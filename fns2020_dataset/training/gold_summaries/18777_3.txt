Chairman’s statement
The Group’s balance sheet and liquidity 
position is continuing to improve and whilst 
market conditions are fragile, we are confident 
about our strategy for the future.
IntroductIon
I am pleased to report that the year ended 30 June 2010 
saw market conditions change dramatically during the 
second half. Demand for land with planning consent 
improved, leading to a significant increase in turnover, 
which in turn has improved the Group’s liquidity position 
and returned it to profitability. We also raised a small 
amount of new equity during the early and latter part 
of the year to improve our working capital in a climate 
where securing bank finance has proved to be 
extremely challenging. 
results
Total turnover resulting from sales, rental income and 
management fees was £16.5m (2009: £5.2m). Operating 
profit was £2.0m (2009: operating loss of £7.7m) and profit 
before tax was £1.1m (2009: loss before tax of £10.5m). 
operatIonal revIew
The results demonstrate that the market for land in the 
South East of England has improved significantly with the 
larger housebuilders showing more interest in purchasing 
land to replenish their land banks within their local regions. 
We have disposed of most of the smaller sites within our 
portfolio and our strategy is to secure larger sites which 
will predominantly be purchased with joint venture partners. 
Our priority has been to generate cash flow in order to reduce 
both bank debt and settle outstanding deferred land payments. 
During the year ended 30 June 2010 we sold 158 building 
plots (2009: 25 building plots) and ten completed apartments 
at our development in Byfleet. On the planning front we 
were successful in obtaining planning permission on all 
but four sites within our portfolio. In May 2010, a resolution 
to grant planning permission subject to the signing of 
a legal agreement was received at West Drayton for 773 
units and 55,000 sq ft of commercial space comprising 
a nursing home, a primary care trust and some office 
space. The legal agreement has now been signed and 
the planning permission issued. 
The land bank under our control currently comprises of 1,357 
consented residential plots and 163,000 sq ft of consented 
commercial space including 80,000 sq ft for two care homes. 
We have a further 600 plots and 100,000 sq ft of commercial 
space being processed through the planning system.  09

notice of annual general meeting
Since the year end we have completed the sale of one site 
and exchanged contracts on two others with a total value 
of £9.4m. We have also completed the sale of ten residential 
units since the year end with forward sales of ten residential 
units either reserved or exchanged. Looking forward, we 
have also agreed the sale of 89 plots and 40,000 sq ft of 
commercial space for approximately £12.7m which has 
no associated debt.
FInancIal summary The net profit for the year ended 30 June 2010 was £1.2m 
(2009: net loss of £12.7m) which represents earnings per 
share of 0.68p (2009: loss per share of 7.83p). The interest 
expense increased significantly over the previous year as it 
includes various professional fees that we have had to incur 
to conclude the renewal of our revolving credit facility with 
RBS which currently stands at £8.0m against a drawn down 
position of £5.2m. As at the year end we had outstanding 
deferred consideration payments of £6.0m (2009: £13.0m) 
of which £2.0m has been paid and the balance is due to be 
repaid by March 2011. Net assets at the year end were £44.5m 
which translate to 24.3p per share (2009: 24.9p per share). 
Net debt stood at £6.7m (2009: £6.5m) with gearing (including 
outstanding deferred consideration payments) reduced 
to 34.2% (2009: 47.3%).
Investments
Our associate company, Howarth Homes PLC has seen 
trading improve over its last financial year to 31 July 2010 
having refinanced its loans out of RBS. Howarth has returned 
to profitability and is currently developing five sites with a 
total of 111 units which includes a site of 51 units in a joint 
venture with Inland. In addition, the company has construction 
contracts in hand valued at £24m. 
outlook
Whilst the current economic uncertainty, lack of mortgage 
finance and shortage of bank funding for land are a concern 
for the Group, we are pleased that the Group’s existing 
sites are located in areas of good demand and will continue 
to generate cash flow and profitability. Our strategy is to 
pursue larger opportunities in partnership with others and 
where appropriate small scale residential developments. 
The Group’s financial and liquidity position is continuing 
to improve and whilst market conditions are fragile, 
we are confident about our strategy for the future.

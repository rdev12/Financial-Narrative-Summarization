 Chairman’s letter
Financial performance
easyJet has delivered a resilient financial 
performance this year, despite a number 
of events that have disproportionately 
affected easyJet when compared with 
other airlines.
easyJet grew its passenger numbers 
to a new high of 73.1 million, showing 
continued strong demand for its 
services. This record level of flying 
generated slightly reduced revenues 
of £4,669 million in 2016, as passengers 
benefitted from low fares, with a 
reinforced programme of cost controls, 
that delivered savings ahead of target 
of £95 million. easyJet's profit before 
tax was £495 million.
Strategy
easyJet's strategy is founded on 
leadership positions at many of Europe's 
foremost airports, providing the 
frequency and wide range of convenient 
destinations demanded by customers 
combined with a relentless focus on cost 
control which allows us to offer excellent 
value fares, making travel easy and 
affordable. Despite challenging market 
conditions characterised by multiple 
terrorist actions, industrial strikes, 
geopolitical instability and currency 
movements as well as excess market 
capacity, easyJet’s lean business model 
and effective strategy continue to 
identify opportunities for highly targeted 
and profitable growth, which will deliver 
long-term value to shareholders.
EU referendum
easyJet remains committed to the UK 
and has taken steps to secure the future 
of the business following the outcome 
of the EU referendum. We are in the 
process of selecting a preferred country 
in which to obtain an EU-based Air 
Operator Certificate (AOC), securing 
flying rights in Europe. easyJet will 
continue to work closely with the UK 
Government and the EU to maintain 
a liberal aviation market in Europe.
People
easyJet’s focus on its culture and people, 
its "Orange spirit", is a key contributor to 
easyJet’s success. In a very difficult year 
it has been this spirit of commitment to 
passengers, particularly by front-line staff, 
that has ensured easyJet remains 
amongst the strongest airlines in Europe.
During the year Chris Browne joined 
as a Non-Executive Director and, with 
a strong background in aviation, has 
made a significant contribution to board 
discussions. I am pleased that she has 
easyJet has delivered 
a resilient financial 
performance this year, 
with record passenger 
numbers showing 
continued strong 
demand for its services. 
We are investing for the 
future in order to deliver 
sustainable long-term 
value for shareholders.
JOHN BARTON
Chairman
now accepted an executive role in the 
business as our Chief Operating Officer, 
in which I believe she will make a major 
contribution in developing that part of 
the business.
Shareholder returns
In May, the Board increased the dividend 
payout ratio to 50%. This is a further 
demonstration of its confidence in the 
future of the business. Since starting 
to pay a dividend in 2011, easyJet has 
steadily increased the ratio. In total 
easyJet has returned more than £1 billion 
in dividends to shareholders since 2011 
and the Board is pleased to recommend 
a dividend for the year of 53.8 pence 
per share.
Looking ahead
Looking ahead to 2017, easyJet expects 
the European short-haul aviation market 
to continue to grow. However, with 
continuing uncertainty in the economic 
and political outlook, we will remain 
vigilant with regards to changes in 
demand and market behaviour.
In the meantime, easyJet is investing in 
initiatives that will drive efficiency and 
innovation to support long-term revenue 
growth and mitigate the effect of factors 
that are outside of the airline’s control, 
such as disruption and the impact of 
foreign exchange rate changes on 
demand and on the cost base.
We firmly believe that our business 
model, cost position and strong balance 
sheet mean that our strategy is the right 
one to deliver sustainable long-term value 
for shareholders.

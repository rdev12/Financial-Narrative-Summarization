BUSINESS REVIEW 
Chairman’s statement 
 
It has been a challenging year for 
Kingfisher, but I am pleased to report that 
we finished the year in good shape, with 
a strong balance sheet, higher market 
share in Europe and with our medium 
term programme of self-help initiatives 
(Creating the Leader) progressing well.  
Our reported results were affected by 
adverse currency movements, and the 
particularly poor summer weather in 
Northern Europe literally dampened 
customer demand during our peak 
season. Add to this the economic 
uncertainty our customers are facing 
across Europe and it is no surprise that 
2012 was difficult for retailers in general.  
But our teams have worked hard, actively 
managing the business, focusing on 
improving our customer offer and 
optimising our cash generation in these 
difficult markets. These are the right 
things to do to ensure we can deliver 
value for shareholders over the medium 
term. We achieved growth in France, our 
most significant market, and continued to 
expand in Poland, Russia, Turkey and 
Spain. Whilst B&Q found the UK 
consumer market difficult, our trade 
businesses in the UK, Screwfix and 
TradePoint, grew strongly. We remain 
confident in our future prospects and it is 
for this reason that we are proposing to 
raise the dividend by 7.0% despite 
adjusted pre-tax profits being down 
11.4% to £715m. 
We have also continued to make good 
progress on our sustainability agenda, 
with the launch in October of our Net 
Positive plan. You can read more  
about Net Positive on page 16. 
I would like to welcome two new directors 
who joined the Board in October. Karen 
Witts joined as Group Finance Director 
and brings with her a wealth of financial 
and operational management experience 
from her previous roles at Vodafone and 
BT, among others. Philippe Tible, a 
highly experienced retailer, who is 
responsible for our Castorama and Brico 
Dépôt brands across Europe, also joined 
the board. Euan Sutherland stepped 
down from the Board in January to take 
up a CEO role outside the Group and we 
wish him well in his new position. 
I would like to thank our 78,000 staff for 
their hard work and commitment during 
these difficult economic times. They have 
done an excellent job providing the level 
of service which customers expect and  
ensuring that we start the new year  
with confidence.

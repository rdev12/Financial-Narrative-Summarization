London Bridge 
station contract
The redevelopment of London Bridge 
station is a key part of the Thameslink 
Programme, which aims to increase 
significantly the total frequency of trains 
through the station per hour. Work 
is due to commence in full in 2013 and 
is scheduled for completion in 2018.

remains fully operational at all times 
to minimise disruption to passengers.
£150m 
Highways contract
Costain was awarded a contract worth 
£150 million by the Welsh Government 
to construct the A465 Heads of the 
Valleys road in South Wales.
In partnership with Atkins, Halcrow and 
RPS Group, Costain will design and 
construct an 8km section between 
Brynmawr and Gilwern. The project 
will present significant engineering and 
environmental challenges as the road 
passes through a number of Sites of 
Special Scientific Interest including 
the Clydach Gorge within the Brecon 
Beacons National Park.
Promanex
In August 2011, Costain announced 
that it had acquired Promanex, an 
industrial support services business 
providing facilities management, 
installation, repair and maintenance 
and general asset management 
in a number of high-growth, 
specialist markets such as power, 
petrochemicals and nuclear.
Mark Dixon, Managing Director of 
Promanex, said: “We are delighted 
to be joining Costain. Costain rightly 
has an outstanding reputation for 
applying technological expertise and 
innovation to add value to customers. 
Allied with Promanex’s proven 
capabilities and market leading 
position in our core sectors, 
we will make a formidable team. 
“Costain has an exciting future and 
we are very much looking forward 
to being a part of it.”

A strong  
and growing 
business
Through our network of 1,315 neighbourhood stores, our 18,685 dedicated 
colleagues serve some 4.75m customers every week. We aim to continue 
to strengthen and grow our business by building on the key part our 
neighbourhood stores play in many people’s daily lives.
Convenience 
Our 799 convenience stores provide a 
great range of essential everyday products 
and services to local people living in 
neighbourhoods across the UK.
From a pint of milk in the morning to an 
evening meal, from an open-all-hours 
post office to a great selection of fresh 
fruit and vegetables and food-to-go, from 
the newspapers delivered to your door to 
internet collection and returns around 
the corner – our convenience stores are 
at the heart of the UK’s neighbourhoods.
Newsagents 
With 516 newsagents across the country,  
we are the UK’s No1 specialist confectioner, 
tobacconist and newsagent. 
Our newsagents are not only a strong and 
established part of the business but also 
provide a valuable foundation for our 
continued growth in convenience through 
our ongoing programme of conversions to 
convenience stores.

Our 800th 
convenience  
store opened in 
December 2014
Shortly after the end of the 
2014 financial period we 
acquired an independent 
convenience store with post 
office in Shiney Row, Tyne 
and Wear, achieving the 
milestone of our 800th 
convenience store.
We continue to offer 
our customers more
We are always looking 
to offer our customers an 
ever greater range of the 
products they want and 
this year was no exception 
– we again extended our 
range, notably of fruit and 
vegetables, sandwiches 
and chilled food.
Growing off  
licence business
769 of our convenience 
stores offer beers, wines and 
spirits to complement our 
range of meal solutions.

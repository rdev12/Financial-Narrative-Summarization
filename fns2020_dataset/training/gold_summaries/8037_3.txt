Introduction
In our interim statement I referred to the increase in level of orders for our Industrial
products. I am pleased to be able to report that this improvement in business,
continued in the second half of the year. In particular, the activity in December
increased as anticipated to generate the company’s first month in Operating Profit.
During the year significant organisation and product changes have been made. These
changes are starting to be reflected in improved product sales. We have strengthened
our industrial sales operation with additional sales resource and recovered access to
the medical market by exiting the exclusive distribution agreement.
The successful fund raising in December puts the Company in a strong position to
build on the improvements made to accelerate the rate of growth.
Results for the year
Turnover for the year reduced by 9.8% to £616,000 (2002: £683,000). After adjusting for
one off exclusivity payments, received in 2002, like for like product sales increased by
27%.
Sales in the second half year grew 68%, compared with the same period last year,
arising from both increased enquiry levels and improved conversion rates.
Control of the cost base kept administrative expenses (before exceptional items) 16%
below 2002 at £951,000 (2002: £1,134,000), leaving an operating loss before exceptional
items of £684,000 (2002: £981,000). After restructuring and exceptional costs of £134,000
and net interest income of £16,000 (2002: £42,000) the loss before tax was £802,000 (2002:
£739,000).
As a result of the fund raising completed at the end of 2003 the year end cash balance
was £5,047,000 (2002: £897,000).
Dividends
I have previously reported the Board’s intention to devote the Company’s financial
resources to business development. This intention, which the Board believes to be in
the shareholders’ best interest, has been pursued during 2003 and will continue for the
foreseeable future. Therefore the Board does not expect to declare a dividend during
the Company’s continuing formative period.
Management
As announced in January 2004, Ian Smith has joined the Board as Finance Director.
In planning for the next phase of growth we will strengthen the operational
management team further by appointing divisional managers to head up the Industrial
and Medical groups.

INDITHERM plc
Employees
We continue to invest in and expand our work force to ensure that we have the
appropriate skill levels to meet the increasing level of business activity . On behalf of the
Board I thank all of our staff most sincerely for their sustained support.
Outlook
We have commenced the year with a strong level of enquiries in the Industrial market.
This will fuel the growth as expected at the time of the fund raising. These prospects
are enhanced with the opportunity of providing under pitch heating to sports grounds
following a recent order from Falkirk Community Stadium.
Our medical business has been restructured following the exit from the exclusive
distribution agreement. Direct sales are being achieved within the UK for our
Operating Theatre and Physiotherapy products.
Following the successful fund raising we are well positioned to invest in the business
to accelerate the rate of growth seen in the second half of 2003. We have therefore taken
the opportunity to increase selling resources with the introduction of new people and
further marketing support.
With the focus on Industrial and Medical, the Custom Products group has become a
lower priority, whereby we respond reactively to enquiries.
Overall, we expect healthy sales growth and further development of the infrastructure
of the business in 2004.

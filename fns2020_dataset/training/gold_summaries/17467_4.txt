 Xchanging plc
Annual report 2012  
Company overview 01-15
We have particular expertise in complex and critical 
business processing services. We have unique 
domain knowledge in insurance where we process 
policies and premiums as well as handling claims. 
We are also specialists in financial services where  
we handle securities processing, investment account 
and fund administration. We hold a strong position 
in the London insurance market where there are 
currently no other providers and no comparable 
offerings within this market.
In 2012, Xchanging launched Netsett, a global  
net settlement solution to handle the cash flow 
between brokers, cedents and carriers efficiently, 
including effective management across borders  
and currencies.
We provide technology support that is often critical to 
the functioning of a customer’s business. Xchanging 
has a strong track record in integrating business 
critical systems.
In 2012, Xchanging’s technology, delivery expertise 
and international domain knowledge were utilised 
when we formed a joint venture with YTL: Xchanging 
Malaysia Sdn. Bhd.. This initiative was focused on 
developing and delivering enhanced mobile internet 
and cloud-based hosting offerings in Malaysia.  
This year, Xchanging re-launched Xuber, our software 
for the insurance industry, the culmination of a  
£20 million+ investment. Xuber is the only single 
platform solution with global capability available 
today. Our offering boasts unparalleled configurability 
and flexibility with unrivalled expertise in the market.
By leveraging our supplier relationships and applying 
our trading experience and buying power, we are able 
to drive savings to our customers’ bottom lines and 
improve visibility and control over spend. Xchanging 
offers a Gainshare Procurement model: an innovative 
commercial model that enables Xchanging to share the 
risks and reward with the customer. Value is realised 
through any savings generated from sourcing of 
indirect goods and services at a lower cost compared 
to the customer’s own sourcing costs. These savings 
are shared with the customer. 
In 2012, Xchanging developed Vault: an innovative 
custom-built technology platform. Vault has the ability 
to measure, track and report realised savings helping  
to ensure planned savings are delivered.

 The Chief Executive’s Review fully describes the operations of the company over the last year.
I would highlight the fact that we are now debt-free and that the board feels confident in
increasing the final dividend from 2.5p to 4.5p, partially to recognise the loyalty shown by
shareholders who have retained, or acquired their shares over a very difficult period.

Travel
Anite supplies systems to help leisure  
travel companies run their businesses 
efficiently. As a result of market 
consolidation, fewer companies are now 
managing an ever-larger volume of travellers, 
but are finding it difficult to increase profits. 
Our technology helps them to achieve  
that by taking out cost and improving 
productivity while, at the same time, 
offering a greater range of products and 
improving customer service.
Network Testing 
Anite helps network operators and 
manufacturers manage their businesses 
effectively. Our range of tools enables the 
network operators to collect and analyse 
data on coverage and performance; to  
check that networks are strong enough  
to minimise "dropped" calls and to handle 
the increasing amount of data that is 
downloaded by users of smart devices;  
and that devices will work on different 
operators' networks.
Handset Testing
Anite helps manufacturers design efficient 
chipsets and mobile devices, and bring them 
to market quickly and cost-effectively. At a time 
when an ever-increasing number of functions 
are being demanded of devices, development 
and testing are critically important. Our 
systems enable manufacturers to ensure that 
their products not only conform to industry 
standards, but also meet end-customers' 
expectations and are able to communicate 
with other devices on all networks.

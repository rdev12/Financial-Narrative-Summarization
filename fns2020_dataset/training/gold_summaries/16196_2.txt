Capital structure
A US$2 billion refinancing
was secured in March
2009 and a further
US$250 million corporate
facility was finalised in
December 2009. Gross
proceeds of £1.3 billion
were raised from two
successful equity
placings in January
2009 and January 2010.
Coupled with the
anticipated Ugandan
farmdown, the Group
will have successfully
restructured its balance
sheet and put in place a
more appropriate capital
structure for the
medium-term delivery
of its growth strategy.

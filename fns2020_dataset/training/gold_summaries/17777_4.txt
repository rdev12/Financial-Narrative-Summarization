Our operations
Our operations are structured into four business units – 
three with geographic remits and one with a global remit 
(see overviews below). 
This structure has been designed to further enable 
collaboration and promote greater growth opportunities.

projects around 
the world.

two cogeneration plants, 
10 engineering and service 
centres in seven countries 
and employing around 2,500

designs, supplies and erects 
steam generating, auxiliary 
and air pollution control 
equipment, as well as a wide 
range of aftermarket products

Our four markets
Our diversified approach with operations across four markets 
balances risk and maximises opportunity over the long term. 
We provide similar services across our markets (see pages 
24 to 25), winning work through strong customer relationships 
and our proven ability to deliver projects successfully. Many 
of the skills and services we provide to our customers are 
transferable across markets.
Oil & Gas
We are involved in every part of the project delivery phase 
across the oil & gas value chain, but we specifically do not 
operate in early cycle exploration or drilling.
Clean Energy
In renewables we provide a full-service engineering, 
procurement and construction solution on wind, solar, biomass 
and biofuels projects. We also support the full lifecycle of 
nuclear energy and are a respected leader in the design and 
supply of combustion and steam generation equipment.
Mining
We offer mining consultancy (including ore resource estimation, 
mine planning and feasibility studies), design, project and 
construction management services.
Environment & Infrastructure (E&I)
We are a leading consulting, engineering and project 
management firm with strong market positions, especially 
in the water, transportation and infrastructure, government 
services and industrial sectors.

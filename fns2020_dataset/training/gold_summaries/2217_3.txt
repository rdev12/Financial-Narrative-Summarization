Chairman’s Statement.
Overview   
The Group has experienced a difficult 
year in a particularly challenging trading 
environment. Our Chief Executive, 
Neil Gillis, is leading the programme of 
radical change which we believe is now 
beginning to produce the expected 
benefits. Progress has been made in 
rebalancing, rationalising and upgrading 
the store portfolio and in reducing the 
Group overhead base.   
The financial year saw our core Outdoor 
division maintain a sound performance 
in a tough retail market, reporting a small 
reduction in operating profit compared 
to the previous year. By contrast, the 
Boardwear division’s performance 
continued to decline over the previous 
year. With little prospect of an upturn 
in this division’s fortunes we took the 
strategic decision to reduce the Group’s 
presence in the Boardwear market.  
     
 
 “The Outdoor 
division has made 
an encouraging start 
to the new financial 
year reporting 
like-for-like sales 
up by 1.2% in the 
twelve weeks to 
23 May 2009.”
Driven by our customer’s passion for 
style, fashion and their connection with 
the great outdoors, we have made 
great progress with the development 
of our ALS brand. Targeting the fashion 
end of the outdoor market, ALS 
provides unique men’s and women’s 
clothing and accessories for everyday 
use. From heavy gauge knitwear with 
windproof lining to washed combat 
shorts, from summer dresses and 
cami tops to fleeced lined cable knit’s 
the ALS range has grown rapidly.

Our Financials
The Outdoor division, comprising Blacks 
and Millets, achieved an operating 
profit before £2.1m (2008: £3.2m) of 
exceptional items, of £6.3m (2008: 
£7.3m). This reflects continuing progress 
on product availability, improved 
transitional ranges and our success in 
meeting customer needs. The decline 
against the previous year only materialised 
in the latter part of the financial year when 
trading conditions worsened. Despite 
this, Outdoor gross margins were slightly 
better year on year.

The Boardwear division, comprising the 
Freespirit and O’Neill stores and the UK 
wholesale operation of O’Neill product 
ranges, reported an increased operating 
loss before £5.5m (2008: £6.1m) of 
exceptional items, of £7.8m (2008: 
£3.3m). As announced on 10 December 
2008 the Group has agreed to transfer 
the operation of the O’Neill wholesale 
business in the UK to O’Neill Europe 
following the completion of the 
Spring/Summer 2009 season and 
has also rebranded eight Boardwear 
stores to an Outdoor format. 
The early signs of an improved 
performance from these converted 
stores have been encouraging and they 
are being monitored closely ahead of a 
decision on the future of the remaining 
Boardwear stores. 
 
Basic loss per share was 34.63p 
(2008: 14.20p).

Chairman’s Statement.
In order to provide the Group with a 
stable platform whilst working towards an 
appropriate long-term financing solution, 
Lloyds Banking Group continues to 
provide a £35m banking facility, extending 
the term until 31 August 2009.
More details are provided in the 
Financial Review and note 2 to the 
Financial Statements.   
    
 
Strategy    
The Group has a dominant position in 
the Outdoor market. Accordingly, the 
Group strategy is to focus on this strength 
and to manage a structured exit from 
the Boardwear business. A great deal of 
change has occurred over the last year 
and this will continue with a programme 
of upgrading stores and converting 
stores from Boardwear to Outdoor. More 
comprehensive details on these actions 
are given in the Chief Executive’s Review.
 “The Group 
has successfully 
reduced its working 
capital facility 
requirement from 
£40m to £35m.”
The major success of the year was the 
operational progress achieved. The most 
significant element was the improvement 
in controlling operational costs. This has 
been achieved without decreasing service 
levels. Moreover, retail standards and 
customer service levels in our stores have 
been improved.    
    
An improvement in working capital 
through a £5.9m reduction in the level 
of inventory was achieved and new 
processes have been put in place to meet 
and improve on the level of availability 
from this lower level of inventory. Cash 
management had a high level of focus 
through the year with improvements being 
made to our supplier terms and a greater 
focus on collecting our debts. The cash 
outflow from operating activities and 
capital expenditure was mitigated by the 
working capital improvement resulting in a 
cash outflow of £3.2m (2008: £5.8m cash 
inflow) and a closing overdraft position of 
£3.9m (2008: £0.8m). As a result, during 
the year the Group successfully reduced 
its working capital facility requirement 
from £40m to £35m, thereby in turn 
reducing finance charges.   
     
Dividend    
The Board has decided not to declare a 
final dividend for the year, believing that 
the recent performance of the business 
does not warrant the resultant cash 
outlay. We will resume dividend payments 
as soon as the performance of the Group 
permits.     
   
Going concern    
In determining the appropriate basis of 
preparation of financial statements, the 
Directors are required to consider whether 
the Group can continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future.  
    
The Group and Lloyds Banking Group 
are engaged in discussions regarding 
provision of a financial structure which 
will enable the Group to accelerate both 
the exit of the loss-making Boardwear 
business and the development of the 
Outdoor store portfolio.

Board changes
As announced in August, Marc Lombardo 
was appointed to the Board as Finance 
Director. In the same month Nick Samuel 
and Andrew Mallett were appointed 
Non-Executive Directors. Nick was Chief 
Executive of Hobbs Limited, and Andrew 
is currently an Executive Director of Aspire 
Oil Services Limited and a Non-Executive 
Director of Powerleague Group plc. I am 
also pleased that Claude Littner has 
accepted the new position of Non-
Executive Deputy Chairman.
Clive Sherling decided to retire from the 
Board in August and I would like to thank 
him for his highly valued input provided 
during his time at Blacks.
Current trading and outlook  
The Group has made an encouraging 
start to the new financial year. The 
Outdoor division is achieving satisfactory 
like-for-like sales, although trading in the 
reduced Boardwear estate continues to 
be soft.
Total sales for the twelve weeks to 
23 May 2009 decreased by 4.6%, as a 
result of store disposals, and like-for-like 
sales held up well at only a 0.5% decline. 
Outdoor reported a 1.2% like-for-like 
increase and Boardwear declined by 
10.1%. A reduced gross margin of 
52.3% reflects the strategic decision to 
increase promotional activity to drive sales 
growth. The management of cash within 
the business is strong and cost savings 
continue to be made.
The first half outlook will depend on the 
key second quarter and the success of 
our camping and summer clothing lines.
Finally, I would also like to thank our 
staff for their focus and dedication to the 
business during an extremely challenging 
period for our Group.

Further development of the store format has been successfully implemented. The Millets 
‘blue sky’ format delivers the essentially British nature of the brand combined with our 
customers’ desire for good quality, great value Outdoor kit. The ‘cool air’ programme in 
Blacks combines the brand heritage with a modern, mass appeal retail format delivering 
the product brands in a superior environment.

The revenue generating areas for growth fall into three categories  
and demonstrate the Company’s focus on the use of stem cells in

intellectual property built up over the last 14 years in this endeavour.

partner in its search for small molecules that may play a role in assisting 
cell regeneration and in developing cell based therapies for the future.  
Our second objective is to pursue the value existing in our extensive

without the freedom to operate under a licence and will be seeking 
licences from them. Our third objective is to realise the strategic value  
of our specialist stem cell media business. This will most probably be  
with a company specialising in the manufacture, distribution and sales  
of such material. We intend to retain a carried interest in this business  
and will continue to develop new media for the partner.
In research, the Company has some potentially valuable early work in 
genetically engineered rats (taking place in Melbourne) and in the exciting

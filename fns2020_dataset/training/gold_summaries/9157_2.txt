B&Q is the largest  
home improvement and 
garden centre retailer in 
the UK with 358 stores 
across the UK and 
Ireland offering around 
40,000 products for the 
homemaker, occasional 
to serious DIYers, and 
trade professionals.  
In China, the business  
is adapted to the  
local preference for a  
“Do-it-for-Me” model.  
It specialises in the  
fitting out and decoration 
of new apartments. 
 With up to 50,000 
products under one  
roof, Castorama France  
is one of the leading 
home improvement 
retailers in France with 
103 stores. Like B&Q, 
Castorama targets retail 
customers and DIYers 
and has an emphasis on 
style and inspiration for 
homemakers. In Poland 
and Russia there is a 
bigger emphasis on 
projects, as the home 
improvement market  
is at an earlier stage of  
its development. 
 In both France and  
Spain Brico Dépôt is 
primarily aimed at serious 
DIYers and professional 
builders. It operates a  
low-price format which 
offers customers a  
choice of 10,000 
products available in 
larger product quantities.
 Screwfix is the UK’s 
largest omnichannel 
supplier of trade tools, 
accessories and hardware 
to trade professionals and 
serious DIY enthusiasts. 
In addition to its catalogue 
and website, Screwfix 
operates 275 stores 
across the UK.  
 Koçta s ¸, Kingfisher’s  
joint venture in Turkey,  
is now the number one 
home improvement 
retailer in the country.  
Its 37 stores are  
aimed at mainstream 
consumers, homemakers 
and occasional to  
serious DIYers.

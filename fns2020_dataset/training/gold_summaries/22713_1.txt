FIRMLY ON TRACK TO DELIVER 
ON OUR GROWTH TARGETS
GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
the £600,000 Help-to-Buy threshold. We have a 
strong land bank in both divisions but will look to add 
selectively to this, particularly in the Partnerships 
division, where we seek to expand our footprint 
within our existing geographic areas of operation.
OVERVIEW OF THE MARKET
2016 was another positive year for the housebuilding 
sector, with strong customer demand underpinned 
by a structural shortage in housing, supportive 
Government policy and favourable mortgage lending 
conditions. The demand for all tenures of housing, 
particularly in London and the South East, continues 
to be strong and resilient. Political support from 
all parties in the form of Help-to-Buy and planning 
policy reform has both stimulated demand for 
homes and enabled a greater supply of land 
for development.
The availability of public sector land has also increased, 
with estate regeneration opportunities in London 
expanding significantly as local authorities seek to 
monetise their assets and improve their housing stock. 
The mortgage market has also improved over the 
past 12 months, with a wider range of products, 
low interest rates and stable valuation metrics.
There is evidence of the housing market feeling 
the stress of increased taxation, with the revised 
Stamp Duty Land Tax rates having a negative 
impact on higher value homes and Buy-to-Let 
properties particularly in the second hand 
market. This has been more than offset by the 
growth of Help-to-Buy in the new build market 
under the £600,000 value threshold.
The immediate impact of the EU Referendum in 
June 2016 was relatively short-lived, with cancellation 
rates running higher directly before and after the 
vote. Visitor levels remained solid throughout and 
net reservations returned to their previously strong 
performance within a month of the Referendum. 
The medium-term impact of the Referendum as 
EU exit terms are negotiated is yet to be seen.
PERFORMANCE
Both operating divisions have performed well in 
the past 12 months.
Overall, the Group has grown strongly, with total 
completions up 12 per cent to 2,657 (2015: 2,364) 
on the back of construction site starts and open 
sales outlets. This, combined with a 21 per cent 
increase in Group private average selling price 
(“ASP”) to £465,000 (2015: £385,000), resulted 
GROUP STRATEGY
The Group continues to make progress with its 
strategic objectives of sector-leading growth, top 
quartile returns and building resilience through 
the economic cycle. We deliver this strategy through 
our two balanced operating divisions of Housebuilding 
and Partnerships, both of which offer strong growth 
through differentiated models that manage capital 
efficiency and risk. We deliver well designed properties 
at a wide range of price points, from properties 
aimed at first-time buyers to our premium brand 
Millgate homes.
Our Housebuilding model is based on an 
industry-leading strategic land bank, all of which 
is located in economically resilient markets within 
50 miles of London but without exposure to the 
Central London market. Almost 90 per cent of our 
Housebuilding land bank is strategically sourced via 
long-term planning promotion, which ensures over 
20 years’ visibility of future supply, together with 
an average 10 per cent discount to the prevailing 
open market value. Additionally, as 67 per cent 
of this land is controlled via options or conditional 
contracts, it ensures both balance sheet efficiency 
and flexibility through the cycle.
Our Partnerships division operates in the outer 
boroughs of London, the North West of England 
and, from the 2017 financial year, the West Midlands. 
Like Housebuilding, it delivers private and affordable 
homes on larger sites, typically public sector 
brownfield sites or local authority estate 
regeneration. The land is sourced via public 
procurement or direct negotiation and is typically 
low value being developed in partnership with 
local authorities, housing associations or Private 
Rental Sector (“PRS”) providers. As such, it is a 
low capital model offering strong returns and the 
flexibility of long-term development agreements, 
many with phased viability and priority returns. 
The division has an excellent track record of 
winning new work, reflecting over 30 years of 
experience on over 45 regeneration schemes, 
strong relationships with local authorities and 
expertise in placemaking. Typically we secure 
around 40 per cent of bids we submit, which 
gives significant visibility of future work, with a 
current pipeline (land bank plus preferred bidder) 
of over seven years.
We aim to maintain the balance between our two 
divisions depending on market conditions, delivering 
over 80 per cent of our private for sale homes below 
The Group continues to make progress with its strategic objectives 
of sector-leading growth, superior returns and building resilience 
through the cycle. STRATEGIC REPORT
 COUNTRYSIDE PROPERTIES PLC 7
6,434 plots. These included Beam Park (Dagenham), 
Rochester (Kent), Hounslow (London) and a number 
of smaller sites in our Partnerships North region. 
At Group level, adjusted gross margin improved 
30bps to 21.9 per cent (2015: 21.6 per cent). 
Adjusted operating margin improved further, up 
100bps to 15.8 per cent (2015: 14.8 per cent), 
due to greater scale and overhead efficiency. 
When combined with the additional volume, this 
has delivered a 34 per cent increase in adjusted 
operating profit to £122.5m (2015: £91.2m). 
On a reported basis, operating profit increased 
29 per cent to £87.3m (2015: £67.9m). Improved 
capital efficiency, combined with stronger earnings, 
have resulted in return on capital employed increasing 
to 26.8 per cent, up 210bps on the prior year 
(2015: 24.7 per cent).
During the course of the year we experienced 
between three per cent and five per cent build 
cost inflation, initially as a result of higher labour 
costs, although these eased somewhat in the 
second half of the year. We continue to build on 
our strong relationships with our supply chain. 
By giving them excellent visibility over future 
workload, we are able to deliver efficiencies for 
both parties, which helps control our build costs. 
The quality of our business has also been maintained 
throughout this period of growth. Our health and 
safety Accident Incident Rate was 305 (2015: 265) 
and our National House Building Council (“NHBC”) 
reportable items were 0.23 (2015: 0.22) per home. 
Both of these measures are significantly ahead of 
the industry benchmarks. Our customer service 
has improved over the prior year, with our NHBC 
Recommend a Friend score now standing at 
84.8 per cent (2015: 82.7 per cent).
OUTLOOK
Current trading remains robust with sales rates 
and values above year end numbers. The markets 
in which we operate have recovered post the EU 
Referendum and we continue to trade well. We 
remain successful at winning new Partnerships work 
and we had 6,623 plots with preferred bidder status 
compared with 2,957 plots a year earlier. Additionally 
we are working on a potential bid pipeline of a 
further 33,515 plots. Reservations remain robust and 
any softness in higher price points has been more 
than compensated for by our lower priced homes 
and our Partnerships division, which performed 
strongly during the year. Across the Group we 
continue to open new sites, with 43 open sales 
outlets at year end and a further 29 sites under 
construction, giving us great visibility over delivery in 
2017. We have started the year with a record private 
forward order book up 64 per cent and continued 
strong demand which gives us great confidence in 
delivering both our growth plans for 2017 and our 
medium term targets. 
We remain firmly on track to deliver our medium 
term targets of over 3,600 total completions 
per year, an adjusted operating margin of over 
17 per cent and an improvement in return on 
capital employed to in excess of 28 per cent.

in a 26 per cent increase in adjusted revenue 
to £777.0m (2015: £615.8m). On a reported 
basis, revenue increased 23 per cent to £671.3m 
(2015: £547.5m) Our reservation rate per open 
sales outlet remained steady at 0.78 (2015: 0.76) 
despite the increased number of sales outlets 
at 43 (2015: 29) and a short period of more 
cautious consumer behaviour around the 
EU Referendum. At 30 September 2016 we 
had a further 29 sites under construction. 
Our Housebuilding division performed 
well, with total completions up 20 per cent at 
783 homes versus 653 in 2015. Private ASP increased 
14 per cent to £665,000 (2015: £583,000) largely 
driven by product mix and underlying house price 
inflation, particularly in the London commuter 
markets. We saw particular strength in the mid 
priced market and we continue to plan our product 
to ensure it remains affordable for local people. 
Despite a tougher market above £1m, our premium 
brand Millgate delivered another strong performance 
with 81 private completions in the year, up from 
52 in 2015. 
We started on 15 new Housebuilding sites during 
the year, including two new phases at Beaulieu in 
Chelmsford, one of our key strategic sites, and three 
new sites in our Southern Housebuilding region 
as we expand our operations there. 
Our Partnerships division delivered a strong 
performance, with total completions up 10 per cent 
at 1,874 homes versus 1,711 homes in 2015. The 
Partnerships private ASP rose sharply, up 27 per cent 
to £307,000 (2015: £242,000), driven by site mix, 
the effect of placemaking as we continue with our 
large estate regeneration projects and house price 
inflation in the sub £600,000 price points. During 
the year we delivered homes on a number of key 
regeneration schemes, including St. Paul’s Square in 
Bow and Brook Valley Gardens in Barnet, and are 
now on site with four different phases at our 
flagship site in Acton. 
PRS homes delivered the largest element of growth 
for our Partnerships North region in partnership 
with Sigma Capital Group and we continue to see 
PRS as an important method for meeting housing 
demand across the country. In total, we started 
work on 21 new Partnerships sites during the year. 
We see increasing demand for us to work 
in partnership to regenerate public sector land 
delivering mixed-tenure communities evidenced by 
us winning bids during the year which will deliver

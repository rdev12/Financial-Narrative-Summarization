rEcEIpT oF DuplIcATE mATErIAl
There are several reasons why you might get more than one copy of material from Intec.
If you bought shares on separate occasions, you might have different entries on the register (e.g. John Smith and John James Smith).  
A review of material received will indicate if this is the case. The registrar is not permitted to amalgamate accounts without written  
authority. Please contact the registrar directly.
Alternatively, the same information might be sent from different sources. For example, did you join the Alert Service on Intec’s website prior 
to becoming a shareholder? If so, you will need to revisit the website to amend your alert options.

Chairman’s 
statement
Twelve months into the merger of bwin 
and PartyGaming, the combined enterprise 
is ahead of schedule in integrating the 
businesses and delivering the synergies 
expected and is on track to extend its reach 
into new areas of digital entertainment. 
Integration and regulation
The rapid evolution of the online 
gaming industry is continuing, driven 
by advances in technology and changes 
to the regulatory landscape, resulting 
in a business environment that is both 
challenging and full of opportunity.
In such an environment, where the 
competitive landscape is usually settled 
within a short space of time, late entry 
into any newly-regulated market is not 
an option. The enlarged enterprise of 
bwin.party provides a unique platform 
from which to launch into new markets 
with the requisite scale to take full 
advantage of the freedom to advertise, 
often for the first time. As part of our 
goal of participating in all major newly-
regulated markets, we were among the 
first wave of operators to launch on the 
opening of the Danish market at 
the beginning of 2012, as we will be 
when Spain opens later this year. 
Our agreements with MGM and Boyd 
mean that we are well-placed to be in 
the first wave when regulations allow 
entry into the United States, either 
on a federal or state-by-state basis. 
The early performance and the 
potential of bwin.party are 
encouraging, as detailed in the 
‘Co-CEOs’ Review’ on pages 10 to 17, 
where they expand upon the Group’s 
progress and business strategy. In 
addition to reaping the rewards from 
our investment in technology, brands 
and people, we will extend our reach 
into new areas of digital entertainment, 
such as social gaming, by capitalising 
on the Group’s existing resources to 
create new revenue streams.

Governance
As we navigate this critical phase in the 
Company’s development, the Board’s 
approach to corporate governance 
has to be mindful of both the need to 
avoid disrupting the integration of two 
businesses with different governance 
backgrounds and the detailed 
negotiations that led up to the Merger. 
During those negotiations bwin and 
PartyGaming agreed a balanced Board 
would be in the best interests of the 
combined Group, a decision that is 
supported by the success of the 
integration to-date. However, this 
resulted in a Board structure that was 
not in compliance with the Code on 
Corporate Governance in terms of the 
balance between independent and non-
independent Directors.
Despite this imbalance, the Board 
is satisfied that it has maintained 
a sufficient degree of independence 
for the following reasons:
• On the majority of business items 
considered by the Board, a non-
independent Non-Executive Director 
is independent because the interests 
of the relevant founder shareholders 
and the Company do not conflict; 
• On issues when the interests of the 
Company and interests of a founder 
shareholder may conflict, mechanisms 
in the relationship agreement and/or 
letters of appointment for the non-
independent Non-Executive Director 
allow the independent Directors to 
exclude them from the decision-
making process;
• The independent Directors have not 
been and will not be in a minority to 
the Executive Directors;
• The Chairman of the Board was 
independent on appointment; and
• The Board had the appropriate 
balance of skills and experience to 
manage the imbalance appropriately.
This matter, together with details about 
how the Board oversees the interests 
of bwin.party through its operating and 
management structure, is explored in 
more depth in the Governance Review 
on pages 70 to 101 of this Annual report. 
The Board has considered Lord Davies 
of Abersoch’s review, ‘Women on 
Boards’, which requested FTSE 350 
companies to set out aims for having 
women serve on boards. Gender 
diversity is an important factor that we 
will take into account when considering 
any new candidates to join the Board. 
However, gender is only one of many 
issues that have to be considered 
alongside a candidate’s experience, 
knowledge and skills. Our aim is to 
appoint at least one woman to the 
Board by the end of 2013 and to have 
at least two women serving on the 
Board by 2015. 
Directors
Further to the additions to the Board 
that became effective on completion 
of the Merger, Geoff Baldwin replaced 
Rami Lerner as a Non-Executive 
Director of the Company on 15 July 2011. 
Mr Baldwin’s appointment was made 
following a nomination under the terms 
of a relationship agreement entered 
into by amongst others, bwin.party 
digital entertainment plc, Emerald Bay 
Limited and Stinson Ridge Limited that 
was approved by shareholders on 
28 January 2011. All Directors will be 
standing for re-election at the 
forthcoming AGM. 
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final 
dividend of 1.56p per share which, 
together with the interim dividend of 
1.56p per share, makes a total dividend 
of 3.12p per share for the year ended 
31 December 2011 (2010: nil). The final 
dividend, if approved at the Annual 
General Meeting will be payable to 
shareholders on the register of 
shareholder interests on 11 May 2012. 
It is expected that dividends will be paid 
on 12 June 2012. Shareholders wishing 
to receive dividends in Euros rather 
than pounds sterling will need to file 
a currency election and return it to 
the Group’s registrars on or before 
25 May 2012. Further details are 
contained in Share information 
on pages 154 to 156.
Share buyback
Since launching our €75m buyback 
programme in September, the Group 
had purchased 15.7 million shares at 
a total purchase price of £19.9m by 
31 December 2011. As at 22 March 2012, 
we had purchased a further 15.5 million 
shares. All purchased shares have 
been cancelled.
Outlook
Current trading has been robust  
and in-line with our expectations. 
The enlarged Group is in a strong 
position to capture a greater share 
of the expanding digital 
entertainment market.

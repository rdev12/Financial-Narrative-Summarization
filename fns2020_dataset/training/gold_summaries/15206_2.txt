The Group has two operating divisions, the Plastics Division 
(Symphony Environmental Limited or “SEL ”), and the Recycling 
T echnologies Division (Symphony Recycling T echnologies Limited or 
“SRT”). SEL focuses on “making plastic smarter” technologies, and 
continued to advance sales revenue so far solely through the d
2
w 
brand. SRT is, and has always been, an R&D division for tyre recycling 
technologies and systems, and has not yet reached the stage of 
becoming revenue generative.

 a Calculated on a constant currency basis whereby both current and prior period non-euro rental revenue is translated into euro at the exchange rate prevailing in the equivalent month in the prior period.
 b  Underlying excludes net exceptional charges, certain net re-measurement gains and economic hedges (see Basis of Preparation). Underlying is not a defined term under IFRS, and is not intended to be 
a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measures of profit.
 c  Underlying profit before taxation from continuing operations in the comparative period excludes the underlying profit before taxation on the discontinued operation of €2.4 million. Underlying profit 
before taxation including the discontinued operation in the comparative period is therefore €40.0 million. These profit measures exclude exceptional charges of €27.5 million (2007: €22.8 million) and 
certain net re-measurement losses and economic hedging adjustments totalling a loss of €6.2 million (2007: gain of €2.5 million).

The Hunters difference
STRATEGIC REPORT
Established  
brand
Established brand with strong 
reputation
Since the Company’s inception in 1992, 
Hunters has been recognised three 
times in the Sunday Times Best Small 
Companies to Work For survey; won the 
“Best Agent” in the Home Sale Network 
(now the Relocation Agent Network) 
twice; and secured Investors in People 
accreditation at Head Office level. This, 
alongside its strong reputation for good 
customer service and national marketing 
activity, has added stature to the brand.
 
Experienced  
team
An experienced management 
team with a long track record
The Group’s executive management has a 
long track record of operating both sales 
and lettings estate agencies, as owners and 
in developing estate agency franchises. This 
provides in-depth understanding of the 
skills required to manage an estate agency 
business and the challenges that their 
franchisees may encounter.  
Sales and lettings 
combined
Strength in both sales  
and lettings 
Senior management has considerable 
experience running both sales and 
lettings and we believe this puts the 
Group at the forefront for independent 
businesses looking to expand their 
business or develop additional  
revenue streams.
 
Positioned for 
growth
Proven track record of organic 
and acquisitive growth
Having opened its first franchising 
branch in 2006, the Group completed its 
acquisition of the former franchising arm of 
Countrywide plc in 2011. 
Hunters has driven growth organically, 
opening 63 branches in two years to 
December 2015 on top of its acquisition 
of the Country Properties franchised 
network. Network Income increased 
between 2008 and 2015 by a compound 
annual growth rate of 27% (2014: 24%).  
Nationwide 
footprint
A nationwide footprint 
throughout England
The Group has built a nationwide 
footprint over much of England. The 
Group is therefore not over-exposed 
to the performance of any one local 
property market. 
 
Robust model
Proven franchise business model
Start-up costs are borne by franchisees but 
the model makes use of investment made 
by Hunters. This generates scalable growth 
without committing significant capital. The 
franchise agreement(s) contains minimum 
monthly fee(s) due to the Group, regardless 
of the branch’s revenue, guaranteeing a 
minimum level of revenue. 
The Group benefits from having owned 
branches through which it can trial and 
adapt new concepts before rolling them 
out across the network.
The Group implements a rigorous 
Franchisee selection process so as to 
ensure, as far as is possible, that new 
Franchisees are committed to the Group’s 
high standards. Underperforming branches 
can often be reinvigorated through either 
extended training or, if applicable, the sale 
of a franchise to a new team or individual.
The Directors believe that the Group has a number of key strengths underpinning 
past success and promoting strong prospects for growth.

“2015 – Network Income 
has grown by 42%”
Having added 63 branches organically 
in the two years to 2015, we see an 
attractive opportunity to expand 
further our network with new 
franchised branches. As one of the 
largest estate agency and lettings 
networks in the UK, the Group has 
developed sufficient infrastructure and 
support functions to manage a larger 
business. The Directors believe that 
a significant increase in the franchise 
network would require a materially 
smaller increase in central management 
resource whilst providing enhanced 
operational leverage.
“We aim to add up to  
25 agency businesses to  
the network each year. ”
As well as growth of the Group’s network, 
the Directors target an average of 10% 
annual revenue growth from franchisees. 
Strategies for increasing revenue at branch 
level include introducing sales services to 
branches with strong lettings businesses 
and vice versa; the improvement of 
operating practices; and on-going training 
of staff. The average revenue per branch 
increased in this year by 5.6% to £178,000 
(2014: £168,000). The top 25 highest 
revenue branches grew by 12% averaging 
£427,000 (2014: £382,000). 
Our acquisition strategy is designed 
to complement the Group’s network 
and reinforce our geographical and 
strategic reach. Notable acquisitions 
include Countrywide’s former franchise 
operation (acquired in 2011), Hunters 
in the West Midlands (2014) and 
Country Properties, in and around 
Hertfordshire (2015).
The drive for market consolidation 
is covered by both organic growth 
conversions and the opportunity 
for acquisition.
Our objective is to become the UK’s favourite estate agency.
To achieve this goal we plan to pursue organic growth by adding franchise branches to our network and by increasing average 
performance of existing branches through a focus on customer and staff satisfaction, resulting in high levels of retention and 
recommendation. We will complement our organic growth initiatives by seeking targeted acquisitions.

REVENUE
Group revenue for the financial year ended  
31 December 2015 increased by 31% to  
£12.0 million (2014: £9.2 million). This was  
driven by the following factors:
•  First full-year contribution of Hunters Group 
Limited, since they joined the Group in July 
2014. This added £1.8 million of revenue to the 
Group in 2015
•  The acquisition of Country Properties,  
a 23 branch network in and around 
Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and 
Cambridgeshire in May 2015, adding  
£0.2 million of management service fee  
(“MSF”) revenue in 2015
•  MSF from franchised branches, excluding 
Country Properties acquisition, increased by  
29% following the opening of a further 32 new 
branches in 2015. These new branches were a 
mixture of new cold start branches and existing 
branches converting to the Hunters brand
ADJUSTED EBITDA (earnings before 
interest, tax, one off costs and 
depreciation/amortisation) 
Adjusted EBITDA provides a key measure of 
progress made. Adjusted EBITDA for the year to 
December 2015 was £1.57 million, an increase  
of 46% on the same period last year  
(2014: £1.08 million). 
Administrative expenses increased by £2.4 million 
during the year. Higher costs in 2015 were in part 
due to the additional running costs associated with 
being a publically quoted company and also the 
first full year of costs for Hunters Group Limited.
ADJUSTED PROFIT BEFORE TAX 
(adjusted to exclude amortisation, 
amortised finance costs, acquisition 
costs, one off costs and finance income)
Adjusted profit before tax was £1.42 million,  
an increase of 59% over the prior period  
(2014: £0.89 million). 
Amortisation and acquisition costs increased 
significantly during the period, as the Group 
continued to execute its strategy of growth 
through acquisition.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share for the year ended  
31 December 2015 was 2.76p (2014: 1.78p) based 
on a weighted average of 26,317,492 shares  
(2014: 21,292,330) in issue during the year. 
ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE
Adjusted earnings per share, excluding 
amortisation and acquisition costs, finance timing 
and investment income and using standard tax 
rates for the year to December 2015, was 4.74p 
(2014: 3.63p).
DIVIDENDS
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 1.00p 
per share for 2015, which subject to shareholder 
approval at the AGM on the 17 June 2016, will be 
paid to shareholders by 23 June 2016 based on 
the register of shareholders as at 13 May 2016. 
Taking this together with the interim dividend of 
0.5p paid to shareholders on 28 October 2015, 
this equates to a total dividend for the year of 
1.50p. The Company intends to pay a progressive 
dividend going forwards.
 
LIQUIDITY
The Group had cash balances of £1.2 million  
at 31 December 2015 (2014: £1.1 million). 
Since the year end the Group has secured 
further debt funding of £1.2 million to support 
the ongoing expansion of its franchising activities. 
The facility is repayable in full in April 2020, with 
repayments to be made in monthly instalments 
from 13 months after the first drawdown. 
Total bank facilities available to the Group are 
£2.9 million of which £1.7 million is drawn.
FINANCIAL POSITION
The Group has generated strong cashflow from 
operations which is expected to continue in 2016. 
These cashflows, together with undrawn facilities 
available, ensure the Group is in a strong financial 
position from which to carry out its strategy to 
grow the franchise business both organically and 
through acquisition in the coming year.

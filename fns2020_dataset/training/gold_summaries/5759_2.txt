Introduction
Chairman’s statement/Highlights
Highlights
Revenue from 
continuing activities 
up 14% at constant 
exchange rates to 
US$4.1bn.  Organic 
revenue growth of 4%. 
Total EBIT growth of 
15% at actual exchange 
rates to US$945m. 
Continuing EBIT up 
13% at constant 
exchange rates.
EBIT margin of 21.8% 
from continuing 
activities, excluding 
FARES contribution, in 
line with prior year.
Profit before tax of 
US$549m.
Experian’s performance this year 
is undoubtedly testimony to the 
underlying strength of the business 
and to our continued investment 
in our infrastructure, products and 
people, but it is also the mark of an 
exceptionally committed and
hard-working team. Our people had 
to dig deep this year, in the face of a 
challenging environment and some 
tough decisions, and I thank them for 
all their support.
Looking ahead, we are far from 
complacent about conditions in the 
US and UK financial markets, but the 
actions taken by the management 
team this year give me confidence  
in our ability to continue to steer 
through the current disruption.  
I believe that Experian is in good 
shape, strengthened rather than 
weakened by the events of this year, 
and that we can look to the future  
with confidence.

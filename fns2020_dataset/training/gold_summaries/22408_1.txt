 Chief Executive Officer’s review
Extreme emotional behaviour 
I have reproduced on the left a paragraph
from my review at the time of our
Interim Report, not just because the
markets have appreciated significantly
from then, but rather to demonstrate yet
again the extreme emotional behaviour
demonstrated by our asset class.
Placed in context, from the low of 450
in October 2008 the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index (MXEF) rose 75%,
virtually uninterrupted over the next
seven months. You will recall that this
was around the time of some of the
initial references to “green shoots” in
May, which coincided with our year end. 
Since the end of May, MXEF rose to
around 870 in August, an increase of just
over 90% from the low.
Our FuM have appreciated similarly,
from US$1.95 billion in October 2008,
doubling to just over US$4 billion at the
beginning of August. However to
compare like with like, and to measure
the actual progress that we are making, 
I would suggest using straight index
tracking which would mean that we would
be managing US$5.4 billion if we returned
to the high that the index achieved in
October 2007, at which time we were in
fact managing US$4.95 billion. This figure
of “index-adjusted” FuM excludes monies
won via new mandates as yet unfunded
that are referenced under the “New
mandates” heading later in this statement.
Returning to the theme of “extreme
emotional behaviour”, what should
happen over the next few months based
upon precedent is that our asset class
should now take a breather for quite
some time. After the rises of 1999 and
2003 it took at least a year before further
highs were established, and whilst I’m
not suggesting that the circumstances are
similar this time around, the emotional
behaviour of participants within our
asset class will in my opinion be
similarly demonstrated. The index will
have increased in value too far too 
fast and there will be some time taken
for reflection prior to any further
significant advance.
Since the low last October, we have
been focusing our business with two
objectives in mind:
1. Diversification
We have established that our
shareholders, our staff and, I would
suggest, our clients do not like our asset
class’ volatility. Volatility equates to risk
and risk leads to insecurity. Whilst our
shareholders understand both what we
do and how we attempt to mitigate risk,
our staff, even in a year when we
outperform our benchmarks, potentially
receive significantly smaller bonuses. By
diversifying our business, employees, and
in particular our investment management
staff, will benefit in the same manner as
shareholders, and so interests are aligned.
In this regard therefore, we have been
attempting to diversify our business in a
number of ways, some of which have been,
very unusually, successful in the short
term, while other initiatives are taking us
longer to deliver. A recent success has been
the winning of a substantial mandate that
is to be invested in the MSCI All Country
World Index (ACWI) ex US. This is a
Closed End Fund mandate and is
becoming a significant area of focus for us
using the well established volatility of
Closed End Fund pricing as the major
source of alpha generation.
Other areas of diversification involving
our Emerging Markets Closed End
Fund business include the Emerging
Markets Plus Fund which allows us
opportunistically to invest in Developed
Markets when the Emerging Markets are
considered to be too high or when the
Developed Markets are attractively
priced. That Fund, which when initially
funded at the end of March 2009 had

“In my opinion, without
additional new bad news, 
if this market follows its
predecessors, MXEF in
2009 will have appreciated
between 50% and 75%
before there is the first 
sign of good news. This 
is what occurred in 1999
and 2003 after similar falls
under similar emotional
circumstances in our 
asset class.”

assets of US$17 million, is now US$43
million (end August) after an additional
subscription of US$23 million and then
a rebalancing redemption of US$10
million at the end of June.
Our Equities (as compared to Closed
End Funds) Group has also developed.
We recently added both an Asia Value
and Growth spoke to The World Markets
Umbrella Fund (our Dublin based
mutual fund) and created a new
Delaware Statutory T rust called
Emerging Markets Value and Growth,
with the intention of marketing these
funds to institutional investors after they
have established first or second quartile
performance track records.
2. Employees
As referenced in the Interim Report we
have not made any of our staff redundant
during the difficult market conditions of
the past year or so. This is for two reasons
with which you are familiar:
(i) We run a low cost business. We do 
not spend what we consider to be
shareholders’ money unnecessarily. Our
offices are by no means the most fancy,
and when we travel we do not stay in
expensive hotels or use corporate jets!
Neither are we great entertainers, believing
that good investment performance is what
counts as an aid to winning mandates.
(ii)Our business model is (particularly as
our asset class is risky) as risk averse as
possible. We do not agree with very long
term plans, knowing that markets (as we
have just witnessed) can derail them. Also
we do not overstaff. We attempt to use
staff flexibly, increasing the head count
only when we are sure that in so doing
we would not potentially create a
position only to find that we were then
forced to reconsider due to changed
market circumstances.
Obviously we are fortunate in this regard
as we still remain small. I expect that as
we grow some of these values will be
compromised, but to the extent that we
can be careful with the allocation of our
human resources, I would suggest that
this should be for the benefit of our
shareholders, our clients, and ultimately
our staff.
However, having just implied that we do
not take any risks, we have in fact taken
on a number of experienced staff to fill
certain specialist positions in support of
our diversification plans. In this regard
we were taking on staff at a point when
other fund managers were letting staff go
for whatever reason.
The areas involved (all of which are areas
of diversification) are as follows:
Asian Equities, Developed Closed End
Funds, Absolute Return, US Marketing,
Asia Marketing.
Asian Equities, Developed Closed End
Funds and Absolute Return are all
product specific. However US
Marketing, as referenced in the Interim
CEO Review is a new position created as
a result of the end of our agreement with
North Bridge Capital, who have been our
third party marketing provider for many
years. This agreement ends in October
and we decided well over a year ago to
make an internal appointment that
would enable us to benefit and keep
100% of the new fees generated from 
US assets going forward subsequent to
October. There is one exception to this:
one consultant relationship has been left
with North Bridge Capital for one
further year.
In addition, we have made an
appointment in our Singapore office 
to explore marketing opportunities in
Asia. We hope that as we diversify our
business further we will be able to
continue to develop our business in Asia
potentially with new products from our
Equities group.  10 City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2009

Investments
We now hold positions in three CLIM
Funds. These positions have been taken to
facilitate the development of a performance
record in each of these areas. In each case,
at the point that the requisite record has
been established these investments will be
reduced and ultimately liquidated. In the
case of the Global Equity Fund these assets
have been reallocated to the newly-
launched funds. As can be seen below
these investments total US$3.543 million
as of the end of July.

Exercise of options
In my Interim Review I gave notice that 
I would be intending to exercise an option
over 189,000 shares at 29p prior to its
expiry in May this year, and would be
intending subject to market conditions to
simultaneously sell around half of the
resulting shares that I purchased. However,
as a result of changed market conditions 
I took up the entire position and have no
present plans for disposing of any shares.
Market volatility 
Last year I made the point that we had
dealt with a lot of volatility, in fact this
financial year just finished was even worse.
For information I have reprinted last year’s
graph and show it above this year’s.
New mandates
As referenced earlier we have been successful
in winning a number of new mandates. As
of the end of August these were in excess of
US$500 million. We expect these mandates
to be funded over the next few months.

The financial services industry
I really had hoped that our industry had
learnt some lessons as a result of what had
happened over the past few years, but
unfortunately already the signs are not
good in this regard. In many instances (yet
again) the rewards paid to staff seem to be
out of all proportion to the gains left over
for shareholders. In the US it seems that
there is still a need to legislate away
structural weaknesses with more and more
time consuming and expensive regulation. 
I had hoped that the managements of the
companies that have demonstrated some
of the worst excesses would have been
held accountable by shareholders and
thus would not have survived. But in the
event this has not, at least at the present
time, occurred. 
I fear that what will in fact happen is that
when the wake up call arrives the
restructuring of our industry will be
significantly broader and will leave
significantly more scars than anyone could
at present foresee. In my opinion the
barriers to entry within many areas of the
financial service industry are not high and
it is inevitable that what are now
considered very well capitalised emerging
market banks and other institutions will
assume a significant role within this
industry over the next few years. It can be
seen that there are many precedents for
what I am suggesting. You just have to
look around the changing competitive
landscape for other consumer products
around the world (separate from financial
service products) to see the potential.
For our part we are determined to
continue to run a competitive business
that avoids many of the structural
weaknesses demonstrated by our peers.
In my opinion, what we should be
attempting to do is to reward clients
(who pay the bills) with superior returns,
our shareholders (who own the business)
with significant dividends and capital
growth, and our employees (who manage
the business) with relative security and
participation in the firm’s success. If we
can continue to achieve these three goals
relatively fairly I would hope that we will
be one of the survivors as many parts of
our industry are restructured.
Retirement plans
At the end of this year I will be 65, and
subject to approval from the board and also
from my colleagues and from shareholders,
I would like to stay on in my present
position until I am 70, and then to retire.
The exact date of my retirement could
obviously be managed to suit all parties.
Over the next few years I will gradually be
delegating certain responsibilities to ensure
a smooth handover.
CLIG employees
I would again like to thank staff for their
support and hard work in what has
continued to be a volatile and testing
environment.

We have always strived to develop and nurture an investment
process which does not rely on ‘star’ fund managers, but
rather upon a series of analytical procedures that can produce
repeatable and sustainable first or second quartile
performance versus our peers.
Our process employs an array of proprietary tools for analysing and identifying
value. These quantitative tools supplement both macroeconomic analysis and
the trading expertise that has been developed over a period of nearly 20 years. 
Whether it is taking advantage of discount anomalies in closed end funds, or
company specific valuation in our equity business, through three full market
cycles in Emerging Markets, the process has delivered consistent relative
outperformance combined with low volatility relative to the applicable
emerging markets benchmarks.

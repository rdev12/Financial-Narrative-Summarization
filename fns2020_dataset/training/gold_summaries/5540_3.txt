Chairman’s Statement
In the year to 30 September 2009, EBITDA fell by 13% to £445 million and profit before tax and exceptional items 
fell to £208 million, giving adjusted earnings per share of 30.7 pence, a decrease of 22% over the prior year.
A valuation of the entire pub estate has been carried out at the year end in line with our normal practice, which 
resulted in a fall in the valuation of 7%. At the year end the estate comprised 7,399 pubs valued at £5.4 billion.
The Board continues to focus on the Group’s debt reduction programme in order to maximise flexibility when 
refinancing our bank facility which matures in May 2011. As part of this plan and despite the solid operating and 
financial performance of the business, the Board is not recommending the payment of a final dividend.
Trading conditions across the pub industry remain difficult with the economic recession continuing to cause weak 
consumer confidence and put pressure on discretionary spending. Given this challenging environment we have 
worked closely with our licensees and provided unprecedented levels of financial support.
Our operational focus, as always, is to optimise trading profit and to this end we shall continue to invest in our 
pubs and in support of our licensees whilst disposing of those outlets which no longer have a viable future as a 
pub. The disposal programme is expected to continue at a similar or higher level throughout the coming year.
In May this year, the Business and Enterprise Select Committee (BEC) published a report on pub companies. 
Having considered its findings, we have put in place key commitments which we believe will improve the 
relationship with our licensees. 
We are delighted that having examined the issues raised in the super-complaint regarding the UK pub industry by 
the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA), the Office of Fair Trading has concluded that there is no evidence that supply 
ties are resulting in competition problems or that they contribute to higher prices or prevent pubs offering a wide 
choice to consumers.
Given the current economic climate and the reducing size of the estate, we are likely to see some further decline 
in trading profit in the short term. Nevertheless, we remain confident in our strategy and believe that we are well 
positioned to drive the business forward through these difficult times.

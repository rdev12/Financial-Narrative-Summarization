01
A set of six superb Neapolitan tortoiseshell
objects forming a set for a dressing table, each
piece inlaid throughout with minutely detailed
pink gold piqué work of the finest quality.
Piqué work is a technique said to have
originated in Naples in mid-17th century.
It consists of inlaying the tortoiseshell with thin
pieces of gold or silver, and it can be of two
types: piqué posé and piqué clouté or point.
The first consists of cut designs inlaid in the
shell while the latter is small pins inlaid in
order to create patterns and delicate decorative
motifs. The better examples combine the two
techniques, just as this fine suite of pieces,
where the artist applied elegantly the profuse
rococo motifs with small inlaid dots, for
example, in the shell in the side of the tray.

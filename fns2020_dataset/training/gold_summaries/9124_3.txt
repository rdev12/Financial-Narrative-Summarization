an expansion of
geographic markets and,
therefore, the languages
that games content is
localised for and
translated into;
• Growth in social media –
in both digital and boxed
games across social
media, smartphone
platforms such as iOS 
and Android, and the
traditional console and
handheld platforms of
PlayStation 4, Xbox One,
PlayStation Vita and 
3DS, generating more
localisation and testing
across multiple platforms; 
• Dynamic content trend –
the trend towards richer
and more dynamic
content and high quality
standards which require
high calibre localisation
and testing; and
• Increased outsourcing –
the move, by major
publishers, to outsource
their technical services 
as the complexity and 
cost of undertaking 
these in-house becomes
prohibitive.

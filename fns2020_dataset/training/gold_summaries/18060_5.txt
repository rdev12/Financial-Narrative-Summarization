CENTAMIN AT A GLANCE
Centamin’s principal asset, the Sukari Gold Mine, began production 
in 2009 and is the first large scale modern gold mine in Egypt, with 
production ramping up towards c.500,000 ounces per annum by 2017.
process plant
The Sukari plant processed 10.6Mt of ore in 2015, a 26% 
increase on 2014 (8.4Mt), reflecting the steady ramp up 
in ore throughput following completion of the Stage 4 
expansion during 2014. The total annual processed tonnes 
were 6% above nameplate capacity of 10 million tonnes 
per annum (Mtpa). Productivity continued to increase 
throughout the year, with 2.76Mt processed during the 
fourth quarter, achieving the plant’s minimum expected 
long‑term rate of 11Mtpa.

open pit
The open pit delivered total material movement of 
57,766kt for the year, an increase of 28% on the prior 
year. This increase was related to improved fleet utilisation 
and productivity, together with incremental blasting rates 
following the increased daily usage of ammonium nitrate 
(“AN”) from October 2014.
Underground
Ore production from the underground mine was a record 
1,158kt, a 20% increase on 2014. The average head grade 
was 6.5g/t.
A total of 8,501m of development was completed, of which 
6,864m was mineralised (5,389m in Amun, and 1,466m in 
Ptah) and associated with stoping blocks to be mined over 
the coming years. Centamin plc Annual report 2015

Sukari – production upside potential
processing
plant throughput: base case throughput of 11Mtpa with 
potential upside through ongoing process optimisation.
plant recovery: base case of 88% metallurgical recovery 
versus the potential to sustain 90%.
open pit
Fleet capacity: base case of 66Mtpa is below mining fleet 
capacity and therefore offers scope for improved scheduling 
of open pit ore with higher mining rates.
proDUctioN UpSiDe tHroUgH optiMiSatioN
With continued optimisation of the following areas at Sukari 
there is potential for further production growth beyond our base 
case forecasts.

(1)  The potential quantity and grade of the forecast underground production 
is conceptual in nature. There has been insufficient exploration to fully 
define a mineral resource and it is uncertain if further exploration will 
result in the target being delineated as a mineral resource. Strategic report Directors’ report Financial statements Shareholder information

over the coming years as development and exploration continues.

CENTAMIN AT A GLANCE continued
exploration focused growth
There are a number of regional prospects within the Sukari 
exploitation lease which offer potential for satellite deposits 
to feed the existing processing plant.
Sukari Hill exploration
Drilling from underground remains a focus of the Sukari 
exploration programme as ongoing development improves 
access to test the potential high‑grade extensions of the 
deposit. The Sukari Hill ore body has not yet been closed 
off at depth and further underground drilling will take 
place during 2016, predominantly from the Amun and 
Ptah declines.
In addition, there are a number of regional prospects 
within the Sukari exploitation lease which offer potential 
for satellite deposits to feed the existing processing plant. 
Exploration of these prospects continues.
Burkina Faso
The strategy for 2015 was to continue to systematically 
explore and drill‑test the numerous targets along the 
160km strike length of greenstone belt contained within 
our extensive 2,200km
2
 licence holding. This will lead to 
further drilling and resource development during 2016. The 
main focus of the exploration programme is to discover and 
define areas of near‑surface and high‑grade mineralisation.
A signed ministerial decree approving the Tiopolo mining 
licence, which hosts the existing indicated resource of 
1.92 million ounces and inferred resource of 1.33 million 
ounces, was issued on 5 March 2015. A deferral was 
granted by the Ministry of Mines and Energy in November 
2015 in order to continue exploration, as provisioned in the 
Burkina Faso Mining Code.

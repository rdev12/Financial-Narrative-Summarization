development of advanced-stage projects
Cash cost per tonne milled is calculated by 
dividing the aggregate of cash costs by attributed 
ore tonnes milled. We use it to track cash costs 
against productivity. 
Gross profit is calculated by taking our 
revenue and deducting cost of sales. It is used 
to help monitor costs associated with gold 
production and gold sales and our ability to 
manage such costs. It is also used to calculate 
gross profit margin.
EBITDA is the net profit or loss for the period 
excluding: income tax expense; finance expense; 
finance income; depreciation and amortisation; 
and impairment charges of goodwill and other 
long-lived assets. It is a valuable indicator of our 
ability to generate operating cash flow to fund 
working capital and capital expenditures and to 
service debt obligations. 
Cash cost per ounce sold is calculated by 
dividing the aggregate of cash costs by attributed 
gold ounces sold. It is one of the key indicators 
that we use to monitor and manage those factors 
that impact production costs on a monthly basis. 
Adjusted net earnings per share is 
calculated by dividing adjusted net earnings 
by the weighted average number of Ordinary 
Shares in issue. It serves as an indicator of our 
profitability and is often used to determine share 
price and value. 
Attributable gold production is the 
aggregate of the Group’ s equity interest in gold 
ounces produced from its mines and one of the 
key measures used to track progress made in 
increasing our production levels. 
KPIs and relevance to strategy
 EBITDA was US$331 million, a 39% decrease 
on 2011, driven by lower revenue and 
increases in direct mining costs. 
 Cash cost per ounce sold increased to US$949 
per ounce sold, 37% higher than 2011, as 
a result of lower production and increased 
direct mining costs.
 Cash cost per tonne milled increased to 
US$75 per tonne, a 15% increase on 2011, 
due to the same factors as those related to 
the increase in cash cost per ounce sold.
 Gross profit was US$285 million, a 45% 
decrease on 2011, as a result of lower 
revenue, increased direct mining costs 
and increased depreciation.
 Adjusted net earnings per share amounted 
to US25.7 cents, down from US67.0 cents 
in 2011.
 Attributable gold production was 626,212 
ounces, 9% below 2011 production, due to the 
lower grade mined at three of our operations 
when compared to 2011.

RESPONSIBLE MINING
by maintaining our licence to operate through acting responsibly 
in relation to our people, the environment and the communities 
in which we operate is central to achieving our objectives
T otal community investment 
represents the amount of money 
that we invest across our corporate 
social responsibility programmes, 
including investments made under 
various mine site and regional 
initiatives, specific projects 
sponsored by the ABG Maendeleo 
Fund and investments under 
VBIAs/VBAs. It helps us to track 
progress made as regards our 
objective to support socio-
economic development in our 
operating environment. 
T otal reportable injury  
frequency rate (TRIFR) tracks all 
employee and contractor reported 
workplace injuries that require 
medical treatment, including lost 
time and restricted duty. We use it 
to measure progress towards our 
health and safety goal of ensuring 
that every employee goes home 
safe and healthy every day. It is 
calculated as total reportable injuries 
multiplied by 200,000 then divided 
by total number of hours worked.
Operating cash flow per share 
is the cash generated from, or 
utilised in, operating activities, 
divided by the weighted average of 
the number of Ordinary Shares in 
issue. It helps to measure our ability 
to generate cash from our business. 
T otal shareholder return is the 
return on investment a shareholder 
receives over a specified time 
frame based on our share price 
appreciation/depreciation and 
dividends received. It is used to 
compare our performance against 
industry peers.
T otal reserves and  
resources is calculated as the total 
of proven and probable reserves, 
plus measured, indicated and 
inferred resources expressed in 
contained ounces. It measures our 
ability to discover and develop new 
ore bodies and to replace and extend 
the life of our operating mines. 
GROWING
through organic greenfield growth  
and acquisitions in Africa
 Operating cash flow per share was US62.9 cents, down 48% on 2011, 
as a result of decreased revenue. 
 Total shareholder return in 2012 was -1.24%, due to the decrease in 
our share price over the year.
 Total reserves and resources increased to 32 million ounces of gold, 
an approximate 500 thousand ounce increase on 2011, as a result of 
continued progress across exploration drill programmes. 
 Total community investment was US$14.4 million, approximately 95% 
higher than in 2011, as a result of our enhanced community investment 
programme and the introduction of the ABG Maendeleo Fund.
 TRIFR for the year was 0.83, a 30% improvement on 2011, as a result 
of continuous improvement in our health and safety practices.

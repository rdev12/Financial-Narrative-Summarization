  Gordon	P age
Chairman
I am pleased to report a solid financial performance for Hamworthy,  
achieved against a backdrop of a lower order book at the start of the year.  
We have maintained our commitment to product development and once  
again remained strongly cash generative. 
Higher levels of new project activity in our core markets coupled with success 
in increasing our penetration of key market sectors has delivered a significant 
increase in order intake during the year with the closing order book 82% ahead 
of prior year end.
Reflecting market conditions, underlying operating profit was 30% lower at 
£13.8 million (2010: £19.7 million) with underlying basic earnings per share 26% 
lower at 24.1p (2010: 32.6p). Statutory earnings per share decreased 31% to 
23.2p per share (2010: 33.4p).
We have continued to invest in expanding our product portfolio with 
expenditure on research and development increasing by 23% to £4.8 million 
(2010: £3.9 million). This investment in developing new technologies, particularly 
in environmentally responsible products, is a core element of the Group’s strategy 
and will provide a platform for future growth.
Once again the Group has achieved strong net cash flows with positive operating 
cash flow of £19.7 million (2010: £27.0 million) leading to a closing net funds 
balance of £83.9 million (2010: £72.3 million). This provides substantial support 
for both organic development and strategic acquisitions.

Company overview
5 Hamworthy plc Annual report 2011
We remain committed to recruiting, retaining and developing 
the best people and our breadth of talented employees will 
play a critical role in the Group’s future success.
Order intake was nearly three times that of the prior year at 
£290.5 million (2010: £99.0 million) driven by a recovery 
in our core markets and success in growing the Group’s 
position in key target market sectors. In particular the Group 
significantly improved its position in the upstream oil & gas 
market and continues the successful development of its 
Aftersales service and support business. The closing order 
book for the year was £258.1 million (2010: £142.1 million).
The Group has maintained its focus on improving 
operational efficiency with gains made in both 
manufacturing and supply chain and this has provided 
some protection to operating margins, despite the reduced 
revenue whilst enabling the Group to increase its investment 
in research and development.
We are encouraged by the recovery in our end markets 
and the greater visibility of future revenue afforded by the 
increased order book. The Group has a range of substantial 
growth opportunities and the balance sheet strength to 
enable us to exploit these both organically and by added 
value acquisitions. We will continue to pursue operational 
excellence and expect this to deliver improvement in our net 
margin as the Group returns to growth.
These results and our improved outlook are reflected in the 
Board’s commitment to a progressive dividend policy and 
your directors are recommending a final dividend of 6.73p 
which, if approved, would represent a 10% increase in the 
total dividend declared in respect of the year to 10.09p 
per share (2010: 9.17p). Subject to shareholders’ approval 
the final dividend will be paid on 21 July 2011 to all 
shareholders on the register on 17 June 2011. 
On behalf of the Board I thank all of our employees 
for their contributions to another year of significant 
achievement. We remain committed to recruiting, 
retaining and developing the best people and our breadth 
of talented employees will play a critical role in the Group’s 
future success.
We have made good progress during the year and the 
Group is now in a strong position to deliver growth as 
our core markets recover. As a result your Board expects 
a near-term improvement in the Group’s performance and 
looks to the future with significantly increased confidence.

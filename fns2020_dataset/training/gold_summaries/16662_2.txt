Introduct Ion to vesuv Ius Steel division
The continuous casting of steel is a highly demanding 
process that is critically dependent upon consistent product 
quality and optimised production. Vesuvius provides systems, 
products and services that allow steel mills to control the 
flow of molten metal in the continuous and ingot casting 
processes. Our products protect the steel from oxidation and 
chemical contamination, increasing efficiency and productivity, 
enhancing quality, reducing environmental footprint and 
improving the safety of the casting process. 
Steel Flow Control supplies products used to channel 
and control the flow of molten steel from ladle to tundish 
and from tundish to mould; slide-gate refractories for 
furnace, ladle and tundish; slide gate systems; temperature 
measurement and slag level detection; tundish and mould 
fluxes; and control devices to monitor and regulate steel flow 
into the mould. 
These products have been designed to resist extreme 
thermomechanical stress and corrosive environments. The 
majority of these products are consumed during the process of 
making steel and, consequently, demand is primarily linked to 
steel production volumes. 
Products of the Advanced Refractories product line include 
specialist refractory materials for lining steelmaking vessels 
such as blast furnaces, ladles and tundishes. These are in the 
form of powder mixes, which are spray-applied onto the vessel 
to be lined (“monolithics“) and, to a lesser extent, refractory 
shapes (e.g. bricks, pads and dams). Vesuvius is one of the 
world’s largest manufacturers of monolithic refractory linings 
for vessels subject to extreme temperatures, corrosion and 
abrasion. Key success factors in the Advanced Refractories 
product line are installation technologies, products adapted 
to fit customers’ processes and effective and efficient logistics 
services. These factors are successfully combined by Vesuvius’ 
R&D centres, its knowledge of customers’ processes and its 
project management capability to deliver market-leading 
solutions to our customers.
Foundry division
Vesuvius’ Foundry division, trading as Foseco, is a world leader 
in the supply of consumable products and associated services 
for use in the foundry casting industry.  
The foundry process is highly sequential and, similar to 
the continuous casting of steel, is critically dependent on 
consistency of quality and productivity optimisation. The 
Foundry division’s solutions allow foundries to reduce defects 
(and hence reduce labour-intensive fettling and cleaning), 
minimise metal usage requirements (hence reducing 
cost, energy usage and mould size), influence the metal 
solidification process (increasing metal performance and 
reducing the weight of pieces) and automate the moulding 
and casting process for gains in productivity, ease of 
reproduction and overall yield. 
 The conditioning of molten metal, the nature of the mould 
used and, especially, the design of the way metal flows into 
the mould are key parameters in a foundry, determining both 
the quality of the finished castings and the labour, energy 
and metal usage efficiency of the foundry. Vesuvius provides 
consumable products and associated services to foundries 
that improve these parameters.

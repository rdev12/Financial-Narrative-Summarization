Earnings and operating proﬁt numbers are stated, throughout the commentary, before exceptional items and certain re-measurements where applicable – 
see note 2 for deﬁnitions. The Directors believe this measure assists with a better understanding of the underlying performance of the Group. The equivalent
amounts after exceptional items and certain re-measurements are reﬂected in note 4 and are reconciled at Group level in the Group Income Statement. Certain
re-measurements and exceptional items are described in note 6. Adjusted earnings and adjusted basic earnings per share are reconciled to their statutory
equivalents in note 11. All current ﬁnancial results listed are for the 12 months ended 31 December 2006. 
The Group adopted IFRS with effect from 1 January 2005. The comparative data for 2004 has been restated accordingly. IAS 32 and IAS 39 were adopted with effect 
from 1 January 2005, and the comparative data for 2004 does not reﬂect the effect of these standards. Amounts in years prior to 2004 are presented in accordance with
generally accepted accounting standards (GAAP) in the UK prevailing at the time. Turnover prior to 2004 excludes Accord trading revenue. 
All references to ‘the prior year’, ‘2005’ and ‘last year’ mean the 12 months ended 31 December 2005 unless otherwise speciﬁed.

Chief Executive’s Statement
Sales of Tikit 
developed software 
were £1.6m, an 
increase of 100% 
over the prior year 
I am pleased to report that we continue to 
make good progress with the Group’s strategy 
of increasing revenues from our proprietary 
software and support operations. Our leading 
position in the UK legal market sector enables 
us to design software that meets our clients’ 
requirements and provide a depth and breadth 
of support that is unmatched by our competitors. 
Our managed services business performed 
particularly well and made a positive contribution 
to the Group’s results.
It was evident in the spring of last year that the 
weakening economic conditions caused many law 
firms to revise their capital expenditure budgets 
and we saw a subsequent reduction of spend in 
large-scale software projects from June onw ar ds.   
As a result, our consultancy business was 
affected by lower than planned implementation 
revenues and software sales in the second half of 
the year were disappointing.
The Group currently operates and is managed 
across three core business streams: Consultancy, 
Managed Services and Software Sales. Clients 
are delivered an integrated solution based upon a 
managed blend of these three areas of expertise.
The table below summarises Group revenues by 
business category.

Acquisition of TFB
In April 2008, Tikit acquired TFB, a leading 
supplier of practice management systems to 
the mid-market and smaller UK law firms. This 
transaction not only added almost 500 new law

firms to Tikit’s client base, but also enhanced 
the strength of the senior management team. 
In line with our stated strategy, it increased our 
managed services revenues through its strong 
support business and also added important 
Tikit-owned software revenues. The benefit 
of cross-selling opportunities is starting to 
come through and this mid-market expertise 
strengthens the Tikit proposition. Revenues from 
TFB’s contracted managed services now cover 
95% of its overheads, making this a particularly 
strong business in the current environment. The 
benefits of being part of Tikit Group, in terms of 
financial strength and industry expertise, have 
accelerated TFB’s customer mandates against 
weaker competitors in the sector. TFB’s practice 
management software won many awards during 
the year, culminating in its highest accolade 
as the Law Society’s top practice managment 
system (PMS) product.
Consultancy 
Revenues from Consultancy Services were 
maintained at the same level as 2007, which was 
lower than planned as a result of the reduction in 
software capital spend by some of our c us t omer s .  
However, our utilisation and daily rate levels were 
higher than last year, particularly in our financial 
application areas. 
There were two large scale Customer 
Relationship Management (CRM) implementation 
projects undertaken during 2008 at Ashurst 
and Mayer Brown. We believe both will provide 
excellent reference points for other law firms 
considering investment in this application area.
Document Management, the backbone 
application for Tikit over the past 14 years, has 
moved on now to encompass the whole content 
management area within law firms and large 
accountancy practices. Enterprise search and 
web portal access now form an integral part 
of the expertise needed to be credible with 
clients and Tikit are recognised as the leading 
consultants in all of these areas. Significant 
content management and enterprise search 
projects were undertaken at Taylor Wessing, 
Bech-Bruun and Plesner, as well as new 
customers in the financial services market.
Our specialist Practice Management Consulting 
team has now established an excellent 
reputation in its field with law firms and has 
won significant business with larger firms 
such as Allen & Overy and DWF. Additionally, it 
entered into a partnership with Elite, a Thomson 
Reuters business, where Tikit is the preferred 
implementation partner for Elite in Europe.
Managed Services 
Revenues from Managed Services increased by 
30% in 2008 to £12.5 million. (2007: £9.6m). 
Tikit now has approximately 1,000 clients taking 
contracted support services, 18 of which are 
in mainland Europe and 89 of which are in the 
USA. Contract retention rate remains steady at 
approximately 95%. The consolidation of our 
helpdesks into a single client interface and the 
implementation of the Client Care Management 
integrated software have not only improved 
our service to clients but has also improved 
the efficiency of our own operations. Clients 
can now receive self-service support and

Chief Executive’s Statement continued
our management reports guide us to further 
opportunities for Tikit to offer other services, for 
example, training. 
Our technology infrastructure business, NIS, 
had a very good year, implementing a number 
of complex Citrix installations, including 
accountancy client Mercer & Hole. Tikit are now 
established as the leading UK consultancy and 
implementation experts for Riverbed, a product 
used to resolve remote networking performance 
issues and have now successfully deployed this 
exciting product and/or Citrix into 14 large UK 
clients including Kingston Smith, SJ Berwin, 
Clyde & Co and Thomas Eggar.
Software Sales
Revenues from software sales fell to £6.9m 
(2007: £8.1m)as a result of the deferment 
by some clients of capital projects, as well 
as a lower than anticipated take up of newly 
introduced products such as Redwood Analytics. 
The Group has invested considerable resources 
in the development of applications which provide 
‘out-of-box’ workflow solutions to our clients, 
based upon the Metastorm BPM software and 
although some sales were made in the final 
quarter of 2008, the momentum now attached to 
this offering should lead to better levels of sales 
in 2009.
Sales of the market-leading CRM, LexisNexis 
InterAction software, were lower than 
anticipated, with a commensurate shortfall in 
implementation revenues. However, sales of 
our own add-on software, Tikit eMarketing, 
were encouraging following the release of an 
updated version late in 2007. Sales in the USA, 
where there are over 500 potential sites, were 
particularly strong. 
Sales of Tikit developed software, the Intellectual 
Property Rights (IPR) to which are vested in 
the Group, were encouraging, especially in the 
second half. Total sales of Tikit IPR were £1.6m 
including a contribution of £0.7m from TFB, 
an increase of 100% over the prior year 
(2007: £0.8m).
Outlook
Given the tougher trading conditions expected 
over the next 12 to 18 months, we will continue 
to focus on providing excellent service levels in 
order to maintain the high renewal-rate of our 
managed services contracts. Revenues from 
these contracts represented 44% of the Group’s 
revenues in 2008 and are a key element of the 
Group’s strategy.
Our continued focus on Tikit’s own software 
should enable our clients to capitalise on their 
existing investment in CRM and Document 
Management systems as we provide high-value, 
low-cost, add-on applications. In addition, we 
anticipate increased penetration by TFB into the 
mid-size law firm market as a result of it being 
part of Tikit Group.
The operational focus for 2009 will be to 
continue to place particular emphasis on

Tikit-owned software sales, better utilisation 
of resources, strong cost control and cash 
management in order to deliver increased 
margins from an improved business mix.
 
Trading in the first 10 weeks of 2009 has been 
satisfactory and we expect to meet our internal 
first quarter targets. Tight cost control in 2009 
should help to mitigate our exposure to any 
further capital project deferrals by our clients.

I am pleased to report that in the last 12 months 
we have seen continued progress across all areas 
of our business.
2015 proved to be a significant year for ValiRx 
both in terms of restructuring the capital of the 
Company and technical advancements made 
with both our therapeutic compounds, VAL201 
and VAL401. We also saw development in our 
Finnish subsidiary, ValiFinn, which includes TRAC 
and our biomarker technologies.
We have taken a number of steps forward in the 
development of VAL201 in terms of its Phase I/II 
Clinical Trial and we have also completed the final 
preparatory pre-clinical work for VAL401, which 
now means that this drug candidate is about to 
enter a pivotal Phase IIb efficacy trial.
Our Finland–based operation continues to 
generate interest among Clinical Research 
Organisations (“CROs”) regarding our unique 
TRAC gene expression analysis platform 
technology, which we acquired in February 2015. 
We have seen positive enhancements of our 
own biomarker development programme, with 
new European, Japanese and US patents being 
secured during the period.
ValiRx attended the 2015 BIO International 
convention in Philadelphia, USA, which took 
place in June 2015 alongside many other leading 
UK biotechnology and biopharma businesses. 
This invitation to participate in the ‘Market Visit’ , 
organised by the Mayor of London’s Export 
Programme, was very welcome recognition and 
an endorsement of the potential inherent in the 
Company’s product portfolio to answer unmet 
needs in the treatment of cancer. Furthermore, 
the visit enabled us to interface with larger US 
biotech companies and investors and on the 
back of an encouraging response from them, we 
have established a presence in the US with the 
opening in November 2015 of a ValiRx office in 
Cambridge, Boston, Massachusetts. Recently,  
we engaged a leading US investor relations  
firm to further discussions with potential  
partners and these are continuing.
Our financial results show revenues for the year 
at £82,603 (2014: £87,558) with net operating 
expenses falling by 4% to £3,034,139 (2014: 
£3,164,664) after receipts of £203,391 (2014: 
£210,802) of grants towards R&D. The net loss 
for the year decreased to £2,118,335 (2014: 
£3,160,031) resulting in a reduced loss per share 
(basic and diluted) of 6.66p (2014: 13.48p). As at 
31 December 2015, the Group had cash and cash 
equivalents of £232,465 (2014: £452,824); however, 
since the period end, our cash position has 
increased following a further raising of equity  
and debt finance, which we believe positions  
the Group well to reach its goals across all  
areas in 2016.

Looking to the future, I believe the Company is 
making encouraging progress towards achieving 
a number of its goals. The expansion of the 
VAL201 trial into a multi-centre study in prostate 
cancer and other solid tumours, is underway and 
this expansion will expedite the production of 
data within a shorter timeframe. We are poised 
to enter VAL401 into the clinical trial process 
and anticipate the availability of data from this 
pivotal Phase IIb efficacy trial. The opportunity 
for developing and exploiting the compound 
VAL201 for a further indication in the treatment 
of endometriosis or hormone induced abnormal 
cell growth in women, via partnering and 
collaboration, is similarly fast approaching and  
the necessary preparatory steps are underway.

assets, whilst looking to further build on and 
strengthen the Group’s balance sheet.

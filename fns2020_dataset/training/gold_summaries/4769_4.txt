Group’s revenues and arise from cremation
services and the sale of memorials and burial
plots at the Group’s crematoria and cemeteries.

in Britain. We operate 25 crematoria in England
and Scotland and carried out 39,600 cremations
in 2008 representing 7 per cent of estimated

Pre-arranged funeral plans represent 
5 per cent of the Group’s revenues. Income
represents amounts to cover the costs of
marketing and administering the sale of plans.
Pre-arranged funeral plans allow people to
plan and pay for their funeral in advance.

the provision of pre-arranged funeral plans
with 204,000 unfulﬁlled funeral plans as at 
26 December 2008. Dignity works with 
a number of reputable afﬁnity partners.

of funerals and ancillary items such as memorials
and ﬂoral tributes. We operate a network of 544
funeral locations throughout the United Kingdom
trading under established local trading names. 
In 2008, the Group conducted 68,700 funerals,

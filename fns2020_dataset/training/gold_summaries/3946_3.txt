Consort Medical plc  
Annual Report & Accounts  
for the year ended 30 April 2013
This year Consort Medical 
has successfully built 
on the achievements of 
2012, with significant 
developments across  
the business. 
Our financial performance has fulfilled the 
Board’s expectations, ending the year in a 
strong position. After accounting for the sale of 
King in mid-February, like for like total revenues 
from products and services
1
 increased by 1.3% 
to £129.5m (FY2012: £127.8m), and like for 
like total operating profit before special items
1
 
increased by 2.9% to £21.5m (FY2012: £20.9m). 
Adjusted total EPS increased by 5.2% to 54.9p 
per share (FY2012: 52.2p).
Like for like Cash Flow from Operating Activities
1
 
increased to £20.0m (FY2012: £17.6m). 
Following the King Systems disposal, our balance 
sheet has strengthened, with year-end net cash 
at £37.0m (FY2012: Net Debt (£37.7m)).
We have made solid progress in translating 
our development pipeline into firm revenue 
generating growth. The Chiesi NEXThaler 
has launched, and our other programmes 
have progressed through several important 
milestones. A year ago I reported that we had 
secured the development contract for Kind 
Consumer’s Oxette nicotine delivery device. 
This has been successful, and in December 
we secured an exclusive commercial supply 
contract from Nicoventures, who have licensed 
the product from Kind. 
Our Innovations team, which has now been in 
operation for two years, has been expanded 
further, and is generating a significant pipeline 
of innovations which we are confident will lead 
to new commercial opportunities and operating 
leverage.
In December we agreed the sale of the King 
Systems business to Ambu A/S for a cash 
consideration of £79.6m ($123.3m) plus an earn-
out of up to a further £32.3m ($50m) over three 
years. The King business had received significant 
investment and management time, the benefits of 
which were beginning to emerge in the reduction 
of the cost base and the organic growth from 
the King Vision video laryngoscope. The value 
received from the sale fully reflects the returns 
which we expect the business to generate over 
the coming three years. 
Following the sale of King Systems, our Group 
strategy remains largely unchanged, though with 
a stronger focus on the Life Sciences sector. 
We have significant development opportunities 
in front of us which will provide diversified 
growth and operating leverage, both in products 
and in services. In addition to these organic 
opportunities, we will review appropriate and 
complementary inorganic opportunities which 
would provide further execution on our strategy. 
Following the disposal of King Systems, our 
balance sheet strength enables us to consider a 
range of opportunities.

I also thank our shareholders for their continued

I am pleased to recommend that it will be 
increased 5% to 12.71p per share. The dividend 
will be paid on 25 October 2013 to shareholders 
on the register at 20 September 2013, following

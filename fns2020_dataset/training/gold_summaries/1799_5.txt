 08 Balfour Beatty Annual Report and Accounts 2012 Last year our Rail business in Australia strengthened 
our presence in Queensland by securing a contract 
with Bombardier Transportation to provide part of 
the state’s ﬁrst contemporary light rail network 
being delivered by the GoldLinQ consortium. 
The Gold Coast Light Rail system aims to reduce congestion and 
improve public transport at the Gold Coast – one of Australia’s 
fastest growing cities. Our Rail business working with Parsons 
Brinckerhoff will design, procure, construct and commission the 
750V overhead catenary system for Stage One of the system, 
which will be a key component of the transport network for the 
2018 Commonwealth Games.

From 2014, you’ll be able to ride safely to Surfers 
Paradise from one of the 16 stations – with your 
surfboard onboard. The 14 new Bombardier Flexity 
trams can carry up to 10,000 people an hour, each 
carriage with 80 seats and dedicated space for 
wheelchairs and prams.
Gold Coast Light Rail will run 24 hours from Friday to Sunday 
night, with services every 7–8 minutes at peak times. Expected 
beneﬁts include fast, safe journeys, a 10% reduction in private 
vehicle trips, a boost to commerce and a 114,000 tonne cut in 
greenhouse gas emissions in the ﬁrst 10 years.

 Continuing  
to grow
Operational and financial highlights
• In 2015, we delivered growth across a range 
of financial measures – increasing sales, profit 
before tax and EBITDA, whilst controlling 
costs and reducing debt.
• Our focus on neighbourhood convenience 
gained momentum as we moved ever closer 
to reaching our target of 1,000 convenience 
stores in 2016.  To this end, we acquired an 
additional 60 convenience stores and 
converted a further 45 of our newsagents to 
food and wine stores – bringing the period-end 
number of convenience stores to 893. In the 
multiples convenience store segment, we are 
the second biggest player in the UK. 
• As well as increasing our number of 
convenience stores, we also expanded the 
range of products and services our stores 
offer. In particular in 2015, we focussed on 
strengthening our food-to-go offer – notably 
by rolling out 148 new food-to-go modules 
across our stores and opening our first 
Subway franchise.
• We continued to build on our position as the 
UK’ s No.1 post office operator. We acquired 
72 new post offices, taking our total to 520. 
We also continued our programme of 
modernising our post offices – around  
90% are now in the new format.

The Wadi Sawawin iron ore deposits are 
located in the Northern Hijaz region of the 
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia approximately 
125km from Tabuk and 60km from the 
Red Sea port of Duba. London Mining has 
formed a joint venture in order to develop a 
mining and processing operation to supply 
steel production in the Middle East and 
North Africa Region with Direct Reduced 
“DR” pellets.
The Isua project is located approximately 
140km northeast of Nuuk, the capital 
city of Greenland, and about 155km 
south of the Arctic Circle. A revised 
pre-feasibility study for a 10Mtpa 
operation is expected to be completed  
in H2 of 2009. The Isua deposit can 
produce a high grade magnetite 
concentrate suitable for both blast 
furnaces and HYL-type Direct Reduced 
Iron plants.
In April 2009, London Mining formed a 
50/50 joint venture company, China 
Global Mining Resources (“CGMR”), 
with Wits Basin Precious Metals to 
acquire and operate the Xiaonanshan 
(“XNS”) mine and Sudan processing 
plant in the Anhui and Jiangsu Provinces 
of the People’s Republic of China. Work 
is ongoing to fully define the resource to 
JORC standards and optimise production 
from the existing plant.

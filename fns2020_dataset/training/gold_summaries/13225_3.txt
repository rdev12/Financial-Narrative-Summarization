in new markets (such as Senegal, 
Estonia and Mauritius) and in new cities
in existing markets (such as Hiroshima 
and Brasilia). In the year to 31 December
2009, we grew our average available
workstations by 5.3%.
During the ﬁnancial year we opened 
45 centres for a total investment of 
£28.3 million. We will continue to 
pursue low risk targeted investments 
to strengthen our market position.
Dividend
It remains the intention of the Board to
pay dividends at a level which it believes
is sustainable throughout economic
cycles and in line with its progressive
payment policy. Reﬂecting the Group’s
trading performance and conﬁdence in
the future prospects for the Group, the
Board is recommending a 33% increase
in the ﬁnal dividend per share from 1.2p
per share to 1.6p per share This will be in
addition to the interim dividend of 0.8p per
share paid in October 2009 which also
reﬂected a year on year increase of 33%.
Subject to the approval of shareholders
at the 2010 AGM, this ﬁnal dividend will
be paid on Friday 28 May 2010 to
shareholders on the register at the close
of business on Friday 30 April 2010.
Chairman
As announced in December, I will retire
from Regus at the Annual General
Meeting in May when Douglas
This beneﬁts from exceptional net
income from settlement of a legal
dispute of £18.3 million but is after
having returned £20.0 million to
shareholders and invested £28.3 million
in developing our workstation footprint
globally. Both actions reﬂect the ongoing
success of our strategy in creating a well
balanced and resilient business mix. 
Financial performance
Group revenue has marginally decreased
2.1% to £1,055.1 million and gross proﬁt
by 22.9% to £235.6 million. Adjusting for
the impact of new centre growth revenue
and gross proﬁt decreased by 3.8% and
23.7% respectively. Average occupancy
decreased to 77.7% from 82.9% in 2008
and revenue per available workstation
(“REVPAW”) decreased 7.0% to £6,535
from £7,029 in 2008.
We continue to reduce our cost base 
to mitigate the impact of the pressures on
our revenue – in the year to 31 December
2009 we delivered cost reductions of
£54.6 million. 
All of these factors combined contributed
to earnings (proﬁt after tax) declining by
41.1% to £67.7 million and basic earnings
per share decreasing by 40.8% to 7.1p.
Capacity growth
Despite the current trading conditions 
we have continued to identify and pursue
appropriate growth opportunities – both
Sutherland, who joined the Board in
August 2008, will become Chairman. 
I wish Douglas every success and good
fortune in the role. He brings with him 
a wealth of business experience, most
recently as Chief Financial Ofﬁcer of
Skype during its acquisition by eBay in
October 2005 and Chief Financial Ofﬁcer
at SecureWave during its acquisition 
by PatchLink in July 2007. Prior to this,
Douglas enjoyed a career of over 20
years with Arthur Andersen (as a partner
for over a decade). 
I would also like to thank Martin
Robinson, who is also retiring from the
Board at the forthcoming Annual General
Meeting for his signiﬁcant contribution
over the last eight years. 
Over the past eight years of my tenure as
Chairman, Regus has been transformed
into a customer focused, genuinely
international company, now operating 
in 78 countries. The past year has seen
extremely adverse trading conditions 
but Regus is well-placed for the future,
with a strong, international management
team and a consistent strategy which I
am conﬁdent will deliver long term value
to shareholders.

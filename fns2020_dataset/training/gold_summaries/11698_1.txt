and actions subsequently taken there is 
a clear route to delivering a successful 
2012 for Pace. Our focus on operational 
improvement and effi ciency is already 
starting to deliver tangible results and 
will contribute further to our future 
competitive advantage. We continue to 
strategically invest in leveraging our 
technology assets across our markets.”
Mike Pulli 
Chief Executive Offi cer
Chairman’s Letter
Through the ‘ups and bumps’, the Group has made progress 
in key areas during the year, including the successful integration 
of the businesses we acquired during 2010, development of 
advanced technologies such as the set-top box for the “X1” 
platform for Comcast and the Home Media Centre for DirecTV 
and the strong growth we continue to see in developing 
markets, particularly Latin America.
Pace’s core is its engineering excellence, complemented by 
strong customer-focused skills and delivery capabilities.
Following the appointment of Mike Pulli as Chief Executive 
Offi cer in December 2011, we have the right leader to deliver 
on the opportunities to grow shareholder value identifi ed by 
our Strategic Review. It confi rmed that Pace operates in large, 
growing and profi table markets with differentiated capabilities, 
and established as the Group’s primary objectives:
•	 	To	build	on	our	position	as	a	world	leading	set-top	box	and	
residential gateway company;
•	 To	impr ove	on	operational	excellence;	and
•	 	To	accelerate	‘widening	out’	by	pursuing	opportunities	to	
provide Software & Services assets.
Executing on these objectives will lead to a realistic medium 
term operating margin target of up to 9%, as well as increasing 
the Group’s ‘sticky profi ts’ – which translates to enhanced 
quality of earnings and therefore multiple.
Despite challenges experienced during 2011, operational focus 
undertaken since the Strategic Review and confi dence in the 
long-term earnings potential from our markets gives the Board 
confi dence to continue building on the progressive dividend 
policy that was introduced in 2009. Therefore the Board is 
recommending a fi nal dividend of 2.50c per share, giving a full 
year dividend of 3.75c per share, an 11.3% increase on 2010.
If you have any comments on my letter or any part of the Annual 
Report, I would be delighted to hear from you either by writing 
to me at Pace or by email at Allan.Leighton@pace.com
Yours sincerely
Allan Leighton
Chairman
6 March 2012
Dear Shareholder
2011 has been a challenging year 
for Pace but, despite this, the Board 
believes that there is real potential for 
Pace to become a ‘great technology 
company’ and confi dence that the 
areas of focus identifi ed through our 
Strategic Review undertaken during 
the year provides a path to unlocking 
its full value.

Chief Executive
Officer’s Review
Key highlights of the year
Pace’s markets have remained resilient during the year, 
with PayTV continuing to show growth despite difficult 
global economic conditions. Overall digital PayTV 
subscribers are expected to grow at circa 10% CAGR 
between 2011 and 2015*. Over-the-top (OTT) delivery 
is expected to be complementary to continued PayTV 
growth. PayTV in advanced markets has embraced IP 
and internet delivery, with next generation ‘IP fluent’ 
devices having become a market reality. In addition, home 
networking technologies such as Wi-Fi are becoming 
increasingly important as is the emergence of TV 
Everywhere technology. Pace is at the forefront of enabling 
operators to address the opportunities presented by these 
advanced technologies. Further opportunities exist for 
Pace in emerging markets as these continue greenfield 
growth and their conversion to digital.
2011 has been a challenging year operationally for Pace, 
with the Company addressing inventory management 
issues and reduced profitability in Pace Europe as well as 
the impact of two major natural disasters. The disruption 
to Hard Disk Drive (HDD) supply resulting from flooding in 
Thailand was a major challenge in the final quarter of 2011 
and will continue to impact results during 2012, with the 
impact to be predominantly felt during the first half of the 
year. Through keen operational focus, working closely with 
suppliers and customers, the impact of this issue was 
contained to $36m of revenue and $9m of operating 
profit in 2011.
Pace generated 2011 revenues of $2,309.3m, 
up 11.9% on 2010 due to the full-year effect 
of 2010 acquisitions, and adjusted EBITA of 
$141.4m, equivalent to 6.1% of revenues, 
down 1.7ppt on 2010. Our Strategic Review 
highlighted opportunities for improving both 
the level and quality of our earnings; we are 
actively delivering to this plan.
I am pleased to be able to report the 2011 annual results for Pace, the first since my 
appointment as Chief Executive Officer on 14 December 2011. Whilst Pace has faced a 
number of operational challenges in 2011, our Strategic Review identified a number of 
opportunities which, if well executed, will deliver significant value for shareholders over the 
coming years.
All of the businesses acquired by Pace in 2010 have 
been successfully integrated, with the related synergies 
realised ahead of and in excess of our expectations. In 
particular, the acquisition of 2Wire continues to deliver 
benefits to the Group, both through increased revenue 
and profitability, and through the technology assets which 
enable us to offer operators the additional applications 
and services that consumers are demanding. In the more 
developed markets in which Pace operates, there is a shift 
towards the use of internet delivery technology for the 
distribution and viewing of content. The combination of 
Gateway expertise acquired with 2Wire and Bewan, and 
the existing set-top box (STB) technology within Pace, 
provides a strong platform from which to capitalise on 
these opportunities.
North America
The PayTV market in North America is the most 
technologically advanced, characterised by the increasing 
emergence of whole home STBs and VDSL triple-play 
gateways, as services demand higher speeds. We believe 
the digital PayTV market in North America will continue to 
see low single digit annual growth in subscribers for the 
foreseeable future.
Total revenues in North America increased by 27% to 
$1,065m in 2011, driven by the full year impact of the 
2Wire acquisition in October 2010. Organic revenues, 
comprising STB sales in the Cable and Satellite markets, 
decreased by 17.7% to $595m reflecting lower sales 
of Personal Video Recorder (PVR) products and a 
normalisation of our leadership position achieved in 2010 
on certain customer specific products. Volumes of STBs 
in North America increased by 3.3% reflecting a higher 
number of lower-value Digital Television Adapter (DTA) 
shipments in the year. Whilst other STB volumes declined, 
Pace did introduce a number of advanced products in the 
developed North America market, including the STB for 
the “X1” platform for Comcast and a whole home solution 
for DirecTV. These confirmed Pace’s continued position 
of technological leadership in our sector and we remain 
optimistic about the long-term strength of the market for 
our products in North America.
Gateway revenues increased by $294m to $392m 
reflecting the full year of trading from 2Wire; on a like-
for-like basis revenue decreased 8% as a result of a pull 
forward of ADSL product into 2010 (underlying growth 
adjusted for this was 10%). 
Software & Services revenues in North America increased 
by $60m to $78m (up 11% on a like-for-like basis). This 
revenue is primarily comprised of customer care, system 
management products and professional services.
Latin America 
The Latin America market displays strong subscriber growth 
and ongoing conversion to digital and is heavily influenced by 
the US market showing a strong appetite for High Definition 
(HD) products.
Total revenues in Latin America increased by 25% to $469m 
in 2011, with strong underlying growth from both Satellite 
and Cable operators as Pace continued to experience very 
high market share in these expanding markets, particularly in 
Brazil.
Growth was entirely from the organic business and mirrored 
growth in our customers’ subscriber bases. Volume growth 
was ahead of revenue growth at 77% reflecting a higher 
proportion of lower value, Standard Definition (SD) boxes. 
The businesses acquired during 2010 had relatively little 
activity in this region, however there are opportunities in 
these markets to deliver integrated solutions comprising 
Pace hardware and software.
Over the last two years Pace’s performance has been 
particularly strong in Latin America as we have been first to 
market with new products during digital conversion, such 
as HD boxes and PVRs, again demonstrating technological 
leadership in the sector. However, this has resulted in an 
unsustainably high market share in these territories which 
we expect to normalise in the next 12 – 24 months as 
competition in the market for the supply of these products 
increases.
Europe
The market in Europe is characterised by high levels of 
HD and PVR penetration, addition of hybrid services and 
increasing levels of home networking.
Revenues in Europe declined by 19% to $458m in 2011, 
driven by a decline in the STB business as Pace ceased retail 
sales and exited from low margin business in Italy.
The well-developed Western European market is primarily 
focused on HD-conversion with over 90% of revenues 
relating to HD products. Furthermore, over 35% of European 
STB sales included a PVR functionality.
Residential gateways remain a small proportion of the 
overall European business with revenue of $29m. Software 
& Services revenue of $18m includes the Latens content 
protection systems, device software and maintenance 
services in support of STB sales. The Strategic Review 
identified significant opportunities among mid-tier operators 
in Europe for integrated solutions incorporating our software 
assets, and we are focused on developing opportunities in 
this segment of the market.

 STRATEGIC REPORT
24 Ebiquity plc | Annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2016
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW
Summary of results
Revenues grew to £83.6 million which 
represents 9.1% total revenue growth over 
£76.6 million recorded over the 12 months 
ended 31 December 2015 (‘CY2015’). 
Ebiquity received a very positive revenue 
benefit from the depreciation of sterling 
against the US dollar and euro. With 33% 
of revenues denominated in euros, and 
26% in US dollars the depreciation of 
sterling against these currencies by 11%, 
both led to a revenue boost of £4.5 million 
or 5.8%. 
Revenue growth was further benefited 
by the impact of the acquisition of 
Fairbrother Marsh Company Limited 
(‘FMC’) in March 2016 and the full year 
impact of our acquisition of Media Value 
SL in March 2015. The impact on revenue 
was to increase revenue growth by 1.2% 
over CY2015. Discounting the impact 
of currency movements and the impact 
of current and prior year acquisitions, 
like‑for‑like constant currency revenue 
growth was 2.1% over CY2015. 
Taken together our Media Value 
Measurement and Marketing Performance 
Optimization practices contributed 72% 
of revenue (CY2015: 68%). Together 
the two practices achieved like‑for‑like 
constant currency revenue growth of 7%. 
Further detail of performance by practice 
is outlined on pages 25 and 26.
Underlying operating profit increased 
by 4.4% from £12.4 million in CY2015 
to £13.0 million and reflected a slight 
decrease in underlying operating profit 
margin from 16.2% to 15.6%. Reported 
operating profit increased from £3.6 million 
in CY2015 to £7.8 million in 2016. The 
prior year included a non‑cash charge 
in respect of the impairment of goodwill, 
purchased intangible assets and related 
capitalized development costs of the 
Reputation business.
Net finance costs were £1.1 million 
in the year to December 2016 
(CY2015: £1.2 million), the reduction 
reflects lower gross debt in 2016 
compared with 2015.
Underlying profit before tax was 5.3% 
higher at £11.8 million in the year to 
December 2016 (CY2015: £11.2 million). 
Reported profit before tax increased by 
£4.1 million to £6.6 million in the year to 
December 2016 (CY2015: £2.5 million), 
due to the non‑cash goodwill impairment 
booked in the prior period.
Earnings per share
Underlying diluted earnings per share was 
11.3p in the year to 31 December 2016 
(CY2015: 10.8p), being an increase of 5% 
comparable with the increase in underlying 
profit before tax.
Highlighted items
Highlighted items total £5.2 million 
in the year to December 2016, 
(CY2015: £8.8 million). Highlighted items 
comprised the following:
• £1.9 million related to purchased 
intangible asset amortization 
(CY2015: £2.0 million);
• £0.6 million share‑based payment 
expenses (CY2015: £0.8 million);
• £2.0 million of acquisition related 
costs, (CY2015: credit £0.1 million) 
including £0.8 million in relation to the 
increase of the Stratigent earn‑out and 
deferred consideration adjustments 
of £0.6 million resulting from foreign 
exchange differences net of the impact 
of discounting to present value; and
• £0.7 million of integration costs, 
(CY2015: £1.6 million) including the 
cost of management restructure of 
£0.5 million and a further £0.2 million 
relating to fees in relation to the 
appointment of the new Group CEO.

Our Media Value Measurement (‘MVM’) practice reported revenue increase up 12.3%, an increase of 3.6% on a like‑for‑like constant 
currency basis. MVM now accounts for 56% of Group revenue. The recent acquisitions of FMC in Ireland and the full year impact of the 
2015 acquisition of Media Value SL in Spain increased revenue by 2.2%. Revenue growth was held back by a decline in revenue from 
our contract compliance business which itself represents less than 10% of total MVM revenue. Excluding contract compliance, the MVM 
practice achieved 6.6% like‑for‑like constant currency revenue growth.

CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER’S REVIEW continued
MVM – Media Value Measurement continued
Operating margin reduced to 25.7% from 28.7% in FY2015 primarily as a result of the revenue decline in the contract compliance 
business which directly impacted operating profit, investment in additional resources in our media business in China to enable sustainable 
revenue growth in that rapidly evolving market and the shift in revenue to lower margin international benchmarking engagements.
MPO – Marketing Performance Optimization (16% of total revenue)

Underlying operating profit      3,739 2,802 1,874
Underlying operating profit margin %      28.7% 28.2% 27.2%
Revenue from our Marketing Performance Optimization (‘MPO’) practice continued to grow strongly, with reported revenue growth 
of 31.2% and like‑for‑like constant currency revenue growth of 21.6%. MPO now accounts for 16% of total revenue (CY2015: 13%), 
which we expect to continue to grow as a proportion of our total business. Operating margins were marginally ahead of CY2015 at 
28.7%, with resources growing largely in line with revenue growth. As we expand our MPO practice into new markets and resource 
for sustainable growth, we anticipate a reduction from current operating margin levels.
MI – Market Intelligence (28% of total revenue)

Underlying operating profit      3,902 3,668 2,070
Underlying operating profit margin %      16.7% 14.9% 12.9%
Revenue from Market Intelligence (‘MI’) declined by 5.2% on a reported basis, and by 8.5% on a like‑for‑like constant currency basis. 
As indicated in our half‑year report and as largely anticipated, revenue from our project‑based research business declined sharply 
during the year and now represents less than 10% of MI revenues. Revenue from Portfolio, our Advertising Intelligence (‘AI’) subscription 
service, and related insight services grew by 1.7% on a reported basis. Eliminating the impact of currency, revenue from AI declined 
1.7% owing to the loss of three contracts in our US business unit at the beginning of the year.
Despite the decline in revenue, operating margins improved by 1.8% to 16.7% in 2016 because of both cost control within the AI business 
and the change in business mix, with costs being managed down with revenue in the lower margin project‑based research business.

       £’000 £’000 £’000
Central costs       (6,806) (6,116) (3,866)
Central costs include central salaries (Board, Finance, IT, Marketing and HR), legal and advisory costs and property costs. Central costs 
have increased by £0.7 million or in 2016 due to increased staff costs, travel costs and IT costs. The increase in travel costs, especially 
in the second half of the year, reflected the need to bring management teams together more often as our matrix organization was 
implemented. 
Taxation
The total tax charge for the year ended December 2016 is £2.2 million (FY2015 credit: £1.3 million) representing a current tax charge of 
£1.8 million (FY2015: credit of £0.1 million) and a deferred tax charge of £0.4 million (FY2015: £1.2 million).
On a calendar year comparative basis, the effective rate of tax on underlying profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2016 is 
21.7% (CY2015: 22.2%). The effective rate of tax is raised by under provision from previous periods. Excluding the release of provisions 
the underlying effective tax rate is 21.0%.
Dividend
It is the Board’s intention to pay a dividend of 0.65p per share for the 12 months ended 31 December 2016, (FY15: 0.4p per share). 
This would represent an increase in dividend per share on a pro‑rata basis and would also represent the continuation of a progressive 
dividend policy which commenced with our maiden dividend paid in October 2015. The dividend will be recommended as a final 
dividend at the Company’s AGM on 10 May 2017.
Equity
During the 12 months to December 2016, 38,063 shares were issued upon the exercise of employee share options. As a result our share 
capital increased to 77,199,751 ordinary shares (31 December 2015: 77,161,688).
Acquisitions
On 11 March 2016, the Group acquired the outstanding 50% interest in its Irish media consultancy associate, FMC. The 50% interest 
in FMC was acquired for an initial cash consideration of €150,000 (£118,000). €643,000 (£500,000) in deferred consideration was 
recognized at acquisition, however the maximum total purchase consideration is up to €2,000,000 (£1,559,000), payable in cash, 
depending on the performance of the FMC business during the period ending 31 December 2020.  Strategic report

Underlying cash from operations represents the cash flows from operations excluding the impact of highlighted items. The underlying 
net cash inflow from operations was £11.3 million in the year ended 31 December 2016 (CY2015: £13.7 million). 
After highlighted items are considered, reported net cash inflow from operations for 2016 was £10.8 million (CY2015: £11.5 million).
Cash conversion has improved significantly since the interim results due to the seasonality of cash flows, but is below the very strong 
cash conversion in CY2015. Improvement in the processes around working capital management remains a key focus for the business 
in 2017.

1. Bank debt in the statement of financial position at 31 December 2016 is shown net of £0.1 million (31 December 2015: £0.2 million) of loan arrangement 
fees that have been paid and which are amortized over the life of the facility. The bank debt stated above excludes these costs. 
All bank borrowings are held jointly with Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland (‘RBS’). The committed facility, 
totalling £40,000,000, comprises a term loan of £10,000,000 (of which £3,750,000 remains outstanding at 31 December 2016 
(31 December 2015: £6,250,000)), and a revolving credit facility of £30,000,000 (of which £29,000,000 was drawn down at 
31 December 2016 (31 December 2015: £29,000,000)).
During the period, the Group continued to trade within each of its banking facilities and associated covenants. Net debt to EBITDA ratio 
was 1.94x at 31 December 2016 (31 December 2015: 2.04).
Statement of financial position and net assets
Net current assets as at 31 December 2016 increased by £3.6 million to £9.2 million (2015: £5.6 million) and total net assets increased 
by £9.7 million to £52.1 million (2015: £42.4 million) as a result of the profit for the year of £4.7 million and foreign exchange gains on the 
translation of overseas subsidiaries. Trade and other receivables increased by £4.1 million to £28.4 million reflecting an increase in trade 
receivables of £3.0 million and accrued income of £1.8 million.
Goodwill as at 31 December 2016 was £58.0 million (2015: £54.8 million) with the increase due to foreign exchange gains on 
retranslation of overseas subsidiaries of £2.8 million and the acquisition of FMC in Ireland adding £0.4 million to goodwill.
Deferred contingent consideration has decreased by £2.9 million since 31 December 2015 to £2.0 million, due to the settlement of 
deferred consideration. Two earnouts relating to our recent acquisitions ended during 2016, and in total £5.1 million was paid to former 
shareholders. At 31 December 2016 of the remaining deferred consideration of £2.0 million, which relates to the recent acquisition of 
FMC and our media business in China, £1.8 million is expected to be settled in the next 12 months.
Outlook
Our delivery on the milestones set out in the Growth Acceleration Plan, coupled with events in the media marketplace – such as the 
debate around the performance of digital advertising – create significant medium‑term growth opportunities. The implementation of our 
plans, the opportunities arising from the changing nature of the industry, make us excited for the future.

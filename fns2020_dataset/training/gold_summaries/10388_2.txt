 2 MITIE Group PLC
Growing together
Ever since MITIE started, there has been a common theme to our progression as
a company… growth. The Group has not only grown financially. Over the years
we have also grown our people, the number of customers and the level of
service we provide to them.
Central to this commitment is our unique business model. MITIE, which stands for
Management Incentive Through Investment Equity, stands out from its peers
because it offers entrepreneurs the chance to develop a business idea in line
with the core services offered by the Group. With the hard work, enthusiasm and
customer dedication of a small company, and the support and professionalism
of a large plc, these businesses can then develop and grow. 
We place particular emphasis on enabling our people to develop to their 
full potential, in the belief that if we look after them, they will look after our
customers. Our employees are therefore focused on working hard together, and
supporting and listening to their customers. We serve many sectors, both public
and private, and provide an extensive range of services, with one common
focus… our customer.

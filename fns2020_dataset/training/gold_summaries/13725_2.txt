Highlights
– In 2013 Ruspetro initiated a re-appraisal of its field development 
strategy. Following significant changes to strengthen its Board and 
management, the Company emerges with a clear set of strategic 
decisions as it re-initiates the development of the Company’s reserves 
and resources.
– The Company, in technical partnership with Schlumberger, revised 
its geological development model to incorporate the use of multiple 
fractured horizontal wells utilising best-in-class tight oil practices.
– Russian Federal tax relief for a substantial reduction in the Mineral 
Extraction Tax (‘MET’) for tight oil reservoirs was passed into law 
and effective from September 2013.
– Production averaged 4,797 barrels of oil equivalent per day (‘boepd’) in 
2013, an increase of 3% from 2012 despite significantly lower drilling 
activity. Natural decline in base production was mitigated through the 
implementation of our waterflood programme.
– EBITDA of US$13.0 million in 2013 compared to negative US$6.2 million 
in 2012 primarily due to a reduced MET effective from September 2013, 
lower operating expenses and higher production.
– The Company entered into a one-year prepayment facility with 
Glencore for US$30 million with the obligation to export 15,000 
metric tonnes of crude oil per quarter.
– The Company also successfully extended the maturity of its Sberbank 
credit facility to 2018. As at year-end, total debt was US$403.2 million, 
including shareholder loans, and cash was US$15.8 million.
– According to DeGolyer & MacNaughton estimates as at 31 December 
2013, the Company had proved reserves of 225 million barrels of  
oil equivalent (‘mmboe’), of which 191 mmboe was crude oil and 
condensate and 34 mmboe was natural gas.

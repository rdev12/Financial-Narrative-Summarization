Strategic Report
Chairman’s statement
Key points in this section:
 – Organic sales increased by 
2% to £667 .2 million*
 – Adjusted operating profit 
increased by 4% at constant 
currency to £152.4 million* 
 – Un f a v o ur a b le c ur r e n c y 
movements reduced sales 
and operating profit by 4%
 – Adjusted operating profit 
margin improved to a record 
22.8%
 – Increase in the total Ordinary 
dividend of 7% to 69.0p 
per share
Adjusted operating profit increased by 
4% at constant currency to £152.4 million. 
Profit was strongly ahead in  
Watson-Marlow. In the steam specialties 
business, there was good progress at 
constant currency in EMEA, largely offset 
by a reduction in Asia Pacific; the Americas 
was flat. Unfavourable currency movements 
reduced Group operating profit by 4%, 
leaving reported profit broadly flat compared 
with operating profit of £153.0 million in 
2014. The adjusted operating profit margin 
improved by 40 bps at constant currency, 
to a record 22.8%.
Net finance costs reduced from £3.0 million 
to £1.5 million but the total income from 
Associates reduced from £1.2 million to 
£0.2 million due to the sale in March 2015 
of our investment in India, ahead of the 
start-up of our wholly owned direct sales 
operation. The Group adjusted pre-tax 
profit was therefore £151. 1 million, 4% 
ahead at constant currency. Adjusted basic 
earnings per share was ahead 2% at 142.6p 
(2014: 140.4p) and was up 6% at constant 
currency, in part due to the number of 
shares in issue being reduced by 3.6% 
with effect from 15th June 2015, following 
the special dividend and associated share 
consolidation of 28 existing Ordinary shares 
into 27 new Ordinary shares.
The pre-tax profit on a statutory basis was 
£139.7 million (2014: £144.8 million) and 
includes a number of non-operational items 
explained more fully in Note 2. The statutory 
basic earnings per share was 129.9p 
(2014: 132.8p).
Cash and dividends
Cash generation was robust, with very 
good cash conversion and we finished the 
year with net cash of £5 million, despite the 
payment of £91 million on 15th July 2015 in 
respect of the special dividend for 2014 of 
120p per share.
The interim dividend for 2015, which was 
paid on 6th November 2015, was raised 
by 6.7% to 20.8p per share (2014: 19.5p 
per share). The Board is recommending 
an increase in the final dividend of 7 . 1% to 
48.2p per share (2014: 45.0p), with a total 
of £35 million payable on 27th May 2016 to 
shareholders on the register at 29th April 
2016. The total Ordinary dividend for the 
year, subject to approval by shareholders 
at the AGM on 10th May 2016 of the final 
proposed dividend, is therefore 69.0p per 
share, an increase of 7 .0% over the 64.5p 
per share for the prior year. The proposed 
dividend is in line with the Group’s dividend 
policy, which is to progressively increase 
the dividend to appropriately reflect the 
underlying trading performance, the 
maintenance of a healthy dividend cover, 
the level of cash generation and the capital 
requirements of the business.
Governance and Board  
changes 
In October 2015, we announced that David 
Meredith will retire at the conclusion of 
the AGM on 10th May 2016 after nearly 
24 years as Group Finance Director and 
after a total of 27 years of service to the 
Group. On behalf of our shareholders 
the Board acknowledges with gratitude 
the significant contribution to the Group’s 
growth and prosperity made by David over 
multiple economic cycles. During his time 
with the Company, David’s knowledge 
and experience have been instrumental 
in helping to guide the business through 
significant changes and challenges, earning 
him the highest respect from shareholders, 
the Board and colleagues. We understand 
David’s desire to step down after such a 
long and successful period of service and 
wish him the very best in this new chapter 
of his life.
“I am pleased to report a solid set of results in 
2015 against a background of progressive 
deterioration in the rate of global industrial 
production growth.”
Bill Whiteley 
Chairman
Performance
Organic sales increased by nearly 2% 
to £667 .2 million. Additional sales from 
acquisitions were broadly matched by 
a reduction from the disposal of M&M 
International (M&M) in the period, with a net 
contribution of 0.5%. Currency movements 
were again unfavourable, reducing sales 
on translation by 4%, leaving reported 
sales down 2% compared with sales of 
£678.3 million in 2014. We achieved strong 
9% organic sales growth in our  
Watson-Marlow Fluid Technology Group 
(WMFTG or Watson-Marlow) spread across 
all regions, while the Spirax Sarco steam 
specialties business was flat, with progress 
in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) 
and the Americas offset by a decline in 
Asia Pacific.
*  Unless otherwise stated, all profit measures exclude 
certain non-operational items, as set out and explained 
in the Financial review and in Note 2 on page 130. 
Organic measures are at constant currency and exclude 
acquisitions and disposals. Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc

Chairman
on behalf of the Board of Directors 
2nd March 2016
As previously announced, we are pleased 
that Kevin Boyd will join the Company on 
1 1th April 2016 and succeed David as 
Group Finance Director and Executive 
Director on 1 1th May 2016. Kevin is both 
a Chartered Accountant and a Chartered 
Engineer and is currently Group Finance 
Director of Oxford Instruments plc, the 
leading provider of high technology 
instrumentation, with sales broadly spread 
around the world across a number of 
sectors and listed on the London Stock 
Exchange. He is a highly experienced 
Finance Director with a strong international 
track record. Previous experience included 
Group Finance Director of Radstone 
Technology plc and before that he held 
senior ﬁnance positions with TI Group (now 
Smiths Group plc). Kevin is a Non-Executive 
Director of EMIS Group plc.
During the year an independent Board 
effectiveness review was undertaken by 
Dr Long CBE of Boardroom Review Ltd. 
Following this review, we have placed 
increased emphasis on Board succession 
planning to ensure the Board is refreshed 
in accordance with the Code. By starting 
this work now, we will achieve a phased 
approach for the succession of key roles 
over the next few years, with adequate 
handover periods to ensure a smooth 
transition. We are committed to appropriate 
engagement with shareholders throughout 
the process.
Employees
On behalf of the Board, I thank all our 
employees in the 57 countries around the 
world in which we have a direct presence. 
Our strategy for growth recognises that 
people are our most important asset 
and through their dedication, hard work 
and personal advancement, we achieve 
success for all stakeholders in the business.  
We value and celebrate the individual 
contributions to the solid results in 2015.
Prospects 
Steam as a heat source, and niche pumps 
and associated ﬂuid path technologies, 
are widely used across different industry 
sectors, geographic regions and customers. 
This leads to our markets being strongly 
inﬂuenced by the level of industrial 
production and changes in its rate of growth 
during the year, with a typical time-lag of a 
few quarters. Global industrial production 
growth progressively slowed from mid-2014, 
reaching no growth by the end of 2015, with 
the deceleration noticeably more marked 
in emerging markets. The likely path of 
global industrial production growth remains 
uncertain, with successive projected upturns 
being continually pushed back.
We have historically outperformed our 
markets, increasing sales ahead of 
general market growth, whilst exhibiting 
considerable resilience in more difﬁcult 
economic conditions. Our strategy 
is focused on self-generated growth, 
to reduce our reliance on the market. 
Our strategic initiatives are targeted at 
increasing the effectiveness of our highly 
trained direct sales force, broadening our 
geographic presence, leveraging our new 
product development and optimising our 
supply chain. We are investing resources 
into these strategic priorities and developing 
a more sector-aligned organisation.
In 2016, we will beneﬁt from the full-year 
effect of the actions taken in 2015 to reduce 
costs and will reinvest these beneﬁts in 
the execution of our strategy for growth, 
including the creation of the new Spirax 
Academy. If recent exchange rates prevail 
for the remainder of the year, sales will 
increase by 3% on translation into sterling 
compared to 2015.

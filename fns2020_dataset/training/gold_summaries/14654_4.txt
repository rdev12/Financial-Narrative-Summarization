Spirent at a glance
Spirent has a broad portfolio of innovative 
products and services and is organised into 
three operating segments:
Networks & Applications
Spirent’s networks and applications solutions put 
innovation to the test within labs, networks and 
IT organisations. 
We enable our customers’ success in development and deployment  
of communications networks, services and applications. Our broad 
solutions portfolio addresses data centers, cloud computing, 
virtualized environments, security, high speed Ethernet networks 
and services, and infrastructure test optimization.
Wireless & Service Experience
Spirent’s wireless and service experience solutions apply 
our innovation to functional and performance testing of 
4G/LTE and 3G mobile devices, services and infrastructure, 
and satellite positioning devices, under real-world 
conditions in the lab prior to commercial launch. 
The portfolio also includes tools and services for end-to-end 
measurement of the mobile experience on live networks, on any  
device and on any operating system. These solutions help our 
customers to minimise the risks associated with deployment  
of new technologies, devices and services. 
Service Assurance
Spirent’s service assurance solutions allow service 
providers to diagnose, troubleshoot and determine how 
to resolve issues with networks and systems within the 
live network. 
Building on the expertise gained through testing technologies and 
systems in the lab, Spirent enables service providers to deploy 
and maintain efficient, cost effective and high performing networks, 
helping to reduce subscriber churn by providing better quality 
of experience.  STRATEGIC REPORT

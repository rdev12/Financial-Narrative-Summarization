TROSOLWG
Mae’n bleser gennyf gyhoeddi bod Wynnstay yn parhau i berfformio’n gryf ac 
mai’r canlyniadau ar gyfer y flwyddyn hyd at 31 Hydref 2011 yw’r rhai gorau 
a gyflawnwyd erioed gan y Grw ^p yn erbyn cefndir o farchnad ansefydlog. 
Cynyddodd refeniw ar gyfer y 12 mis 42% i £346.18m a chynyddodd elw 
cyn treth y Grw ^p 17% i £6.94m. Mae’r cynnydd yn adlewyrchu mantais 
caffaeliadau diweddar yn ogystal ag effaith chwyddiant, yn arbennig ar brisiau 
bwyd anifeiliaid a gwrtaith, sydd wedi bod yn nodwedd allweddol yn ystod y 
flwyddyn yn ogystal a twf organig.  
Mae sail fusnes eang y Grw ^p yn parhau i fod yn ffactor pwysig o ran sicrhau twf 
cyffredinol ac o edrych ar draws holl weithgareddau Wynnstay, cyflawnodd ein 
masnach mewn deunyddiau crai, cyflenwadau âr a gweithgareddau manwerthu 
arbenigol oll ganlyniadau arbennig o dda.  
Ym mis Mai 2011 caffaelwyd Wrekin Grain Ltd , cyflenwr annibynnol blaenllaw 
ym maes marchnata grawn a mewnbynnau amaethyddol, a leolir yn Swydd 
Amwythig, ac o ganlyniad atgyfnerthwyd ein presenoldeb yn y sector âr 
ymhellach. Mae’n cynyddu meintiau marchnata grawn Wynnstay yn sylweddol 
ac yn ymestyn ardal fasnachu ddaearyddol y Grw ^p a’i sail cwsmeriaid ffermio. 
Rydym bellach wedi cwblhau’r broses o’i integreiddio â’n gweithgareddau 
masnachu grawn presennol ac wedi ail-frandio a lansio’r busnesau cyfun fel 
“GrainLink Ltd”, gan sicrhau presenoldeb cenedlaethol i ni ym maes marchnata 
grawn.
Yn ogystal ag ehangu ein gweithgareddau sy’n gysylltiedig â chyflenwadau 
amaethyddol, gwnaethom barhau i ymestyn ein hisadran fanwerthu arbenigol 
yn raddol.  Gwelodd yr isadran hon dwf tebyg am debyg da iawn o ran Wynnstay 
Stores, a gynorthwywyd gan ein rhaglen ailwampio. Mae’r siopau hyn, sy’n 
targedu’r gymuned ffermio yn bennaf, er ein bod hefyd yn denu cwsmeriaid 
sy’n byw yn y wlad yn gyffredinol, yn cyflenwi cynhyrchion annewisol fel rheol 
ac felly mae gwerthiannau wedi parhau i fod yn llewyrchus.  Gwnaethom 
barhau i gyflwyno ein cadwyn o gynhyrchion anifeiliaid anwes Just for Pets, 
gan agor tair siop arall yn ystod y flwyddyn. Mae canlyniadau ein siopau mwyaf 
diweddar yn galonogol ac 19 yw cyfanswm y siopau Just for Pets erbyn hyn ac 
rydym yn bwriadu agor tair siop newydd arall yn 2012.
CANLYNIADAU	ARIANNOL
Yn ystod y flwyddyn a ddaeth i ben 31 Hydref 2011, cynyddodd cyfanswm 
y refeniw 42% i £346.18m (2010: £243.74m). Cyfrannodd gweithgareddau 
cyflenwi nwyddau amaethyddol y Grw ^p refeniw o £274.57m (2010: 
£178.02m) a chyfrannodd masnach arbenigol £71.32m (2010: £65.47m) 
at y canlyniad hwn. £6.94m (2010: £5.95m) oedd elw cyn treth y Grw ^p, 
cynnydd o 17% o gymharu â’r llynedd.  Cyfrannodd gweithgareddau cyflenwi 
nwyddau amaethyddol yn cynnwys canlyniadau’r fenter ar y cyd £3.82m at 
yr elw gweithredol (2010: £3.00m) a chyfrannodd gweithgareddau masnach 
arbenigol £3.70m (2010: £3.46m). Gwnaeth gweithgareddau eraill golled 
fach o £0.19m (2010: colled o £0.13m) a chyfanswm y taliadau cyllid 
net oedd £0.39m (2010: £0.38m). Ar ôl trethiant y Grw ^p o £1.94m (2010: 
£1.71m), roedd enillion net 18% yn uwch na’r llynedd, sef £5.00m (2010: 
£4.23m). Mae hyn yn cyfateb i 30.23c fesul cyfranddaliad (2010: 27.48c) sy’n 
gynnydd o 10% o gymharu â’r flwyddyn flaenorol. 
Mae mantolen y Grw ^p yn parhau i fod yn gryf, gydag asedau net ar 31 Hydref 
2011 gwerth £51.70m (2010: £47.37m) neu tua £3.12 fesul cyfranddaliad 
(2010: £3.08). Mae gerio yn parhau i fod yn isel, er i’r broses o gaffael Wrekin 
gael ei hariannu drwy ddyled ychwanegol, ac mae’n 13% (2010: 7%) ar 
ddiwedd y flwyddyn, yn seiliedig ar ddyled net o £6.67m (2010: £3.47m). 
Cynyddodd elw ar asedau net i 14.2% (2010: 13.5%).
DIFIDEND
Mae’r Bwrdd yn falch o gynnig talu difidend terfynol o 5.20c fesul 
cyfranddaliad, sy’n golygu gyda’r difidend interim o 2.60c fesul cyfranddaliad, 
a dalwyd ar 31 Hydref 2011, gyfanswm difidend o 7.80c ar gyfer y flwyddyn, 
cynnydd o 10% ers y llynedd (2010: 7.10c). Caiff y difidend terfynol ei dalu 
ar 30 Ebrill 2012 i gyfranddalwyr sydd ar y gofrestr ar 30 Mawrth 2012. 
Bydd difidend sgrip amgen ar gael o hyd, fel yn y blynyddoedd blaenorol.  Y 
dyddiad olaf ar gyfer dewis cael difidend sgrip fydd 16 Ebrill 2012.
Y	BWRDD
Yng Nghyfarfod Cyffredinol Blynyddol y Grw ^p ym mis Mawrth 2011, 
ymddiswyddodd y Cyfarwyddwr Anweithredol Edwin Hughes o’r Bwrdd, ar 
ôl cyrraedd oedran ymddeol cytûn y Cwmni. Mae Edwin wedi cael cyfnod 
hir a llwyddiannus gyda’r Grw ^p, ar ôl ymuno â’r Bwrdd yn 1989 pan unodd 
ein busnes â Ffermwyr Dyffryn Clwyd. Mae bob amser wedi bod yn gefnogol 
iawn i’n strategaeth twf ac wedi gwneud cyfraniad sylweddol iawn i’r Grw ^p 
dros y blynyddoedd, yn fwyaf diweddar fel Is-gadeirydd Anweithredol. 
Hoffwn ddiolch iddo am ei holl gefnogaeth ac, ar ran y Bwrdd a’r staff, hoffwn 
ddymuno ymddeoliad hir a hapus i Edwin, ynghyd â’i wraig Jo. 
Yn dilyn hyn, penodwyd Jim McCarthy i’r Bwrdd ym mis Gorffennaf 2011. 
Jim yw’r Cyfarwyddwr Anweithredol annibynnol uwch a chroesawn ef 
fel cyfrannwr newydd gwerthfawr i’r Grw ^p. Daw Jim â chyfoeth o brofiad 
corfforaethol a phrofiad rheoli i Wynnstay, gan iddo wasanaethu mewn nifer 
o rolau uwch â phroffil uchel iawn, yn arbennig ym maes manwerthu.  Ef yw 
Prif Swyddog Gweithredol Poundland Ltd, y manwerthwr stryd fawr, y mae 
wedi’i arwain ers ymuno ag ef yn 2006. Yn flaenorol, ef oedd Cyfarwyddwr 
Cyffredinol Cyfleustra yn J Sainsbury plc, a rhwng 1989 a 2003, Jim oedd 
Prif Swyddog Gweithredol T & S Stores plc, y gadwyn o siopau cyfleustra a 
ddatblygodd nes ei bod yn cynnwys mwy na 1,100 o allfeydd ac a werthodd 
ar ôl hynny i Tesco plc yn 2003. 
RHAGOLWG
Mae’r chwyddiant sylweddol mewn prisiau nwyddau amaethyddol, a 
brofwyd gan y Grw ^p yn ystod y deuddeg mis diwethaf, yn dechrau gostwng. 
Mae cynaeafau grawn da ledled y byd wedi cynyddu stoc o rawn y byd 
ac, o ganlyniad, mae prisiau grawnfwyd wedi gostwng. Mae prisiau bwyd 
anifeiliaid yn adlewyrchu’r tueddiadau hyn ac rydym yn disgwyl i refeniw’r 
Grw ^p ddangos effaith dadchwyddiant yn ystod y flwyddyn i ddod. Er hyn, 
mae tueddiadau macro-economaidd byd-eang, yn cynnwys twf mewn 
poblogaeth, cynnydd yn y bwyd a fwyteir a’r newid i ddeiet gorllewinol yn 
parhau yn ddigyfnewid. Bydd y tueddiadau grymus hyn yn parhau i gynnal 
cryfder sylfaenol galw’r byd am gynhyrchion amaethyddol a chreu cyfleoedd 
i’r diwydiant amaethyddol yn gyffredinol. 
Yn erbyn y cefndir hwn, mae Wynnstay yn parhau i fod mewn sefyllfa dda 
iawn.  Mae’r Grw ^p wedi’i ariannu’n dda ac mae ganddo fantolen gref ac 
mae amrywiaeth ein gweithgareddau yn gryfder mawr. Byddwn yn parhau i 
fwrw ymlaen â’n strategaeth ddeublyg sef twf yn erbyn caffael, yn arbennig 
o fewn ein busnes amaethyddol craidd, ynghyd â thwf organig.  Credwn 
fod y rhagolygon ar gyfer y Grw ^p ar draws ein gweithgareddau manwerthu 
amaethyddol ac arbenigol yn parhau i fod yn gadarnhaol iawn.

INTRODUCTION	
The Group has delivered its best annual results ever in the twelve months 
to 31 October 2011.  This was achieved in a year dominated by inflation 
across all agricultural commodities, which brought both challenges and 
opportunities for the agricultural industry.
As I have noted in the past, Wynnstay’s ability to deliver growth in a 
sustained manner is supported by the broad range of activities in which we 
are involved.  Overall there was an increase in the total volume of products 
traded which, helped by contributions from acquisitions and the significant 
inflation in commodity prices, lifted revenues to a record £346.18 million, a 
42% increase over 2010.  Group pre-tax profits rose by 17% to £6.94 million. 
A notable strength of the Group has been its capacity to deal with inflation, 
through prudent management of working capital and a strong balance sheet.
Our acquisition strategy has continued to support the Group’s expansion.  
During the year, in May 2011, we acquired Wrekin Grain Ltd, a leading grain 
marketing business and subsequently merged it with Shropshire Grain Ltd, 
our existing grain trading business, to form “GrainLink Ltd”.  This established 
a national presence for Wynnstay in grain marketing. The business 
complements our acquisition of Woodheads Seeds Ltd in 2010, the seed 
processor and supplier based in Yorkshire, and further strengthens our arable 
activities.  
Our refurbishment of Wynnstay Stores continued and the operation produced 
good like-for-like sales growth. We opened three further Just for Pets outlets 
during the year and also relocated our distribution centre to a larger facility, 
which will accommodate the continued expansion of the chain.  
Our Chairman paid tribute to Edwin Hughes in his Statement and I would 
also like to add my personal thanks to Edwin for his commitment to the 
Group and the support he gave me during my first years as Chief Executive.  
I wish Edwin a long and happy retirement.  At the same time, I would 
also like to welcome Jim McCarthy to the Board as our new Senior 
independent Non-executve Director.  Jim’s substantial corporate and 
management experience will benefit the Company as we continue to 
develop the business.
REVIEW	OF	ACTIVITIES
Agriculture
Revenues from our agricultural activities increased by 54% over 2010 to 
£274.57 million and the profit contribution rose by 27% to £3.82 million.  
Volume growth benefited from a full year’s input from Woodheads Seeds, 
which we acquired in May 2010, as well as a six month contribution from 
Wrekin Grain, which we acquired in May 2011. This, combined with increased 
trading volume at Glasson and considerable inflation, substantially increased 
the turnover of the Agricultural Division. Feed volumes showed a year on 
year improvement, however, as expected, there was a slippage in demand 
for ruminant feed at the end of the year. 
Chief Executive’s Review
Our acquisition 
strategy has continued 
to support the Group’s 
expansion
Feed Products
Our feed activities continue to benefit from having a presence in both the 
ruminant and monogastric markets. We maintained growth in sales of poultry 
feed, despite poorer egg prices and reduced returns for our customers, and 
our strong relationship with Stonegate, the national egg marketing business, 
continues successfully. Recent increases in egg prices are an encouraging sign 
that the sector will generate more acceptable levels of return for producers.   
With the ongoing volatility in world markets, raw material procurement is an 
important element of the Feed Division. Higher raw material costs, along with 
increased fuel prices, were generally reflected within feed prices during the 
second half. However, margins were squeezed as demand for ruminant feed 
reduced due to extended grazing conditions in the autumn. More recently, 
deflation in grain prices has triggered a reduction in feed prices; nevertheless, 
demand for dairy feeds has been slow to recover. Bibby Agriculture, our joint 
venture business, performed well during the year and maintains an excellent 
reputation for feed supply in the trading area. 
Glasson Group
Glasson Group, our raw material and fertiliser trading operation, outperformed 
our expectations this year. Strong demand, coupled with significant fluctuations 
in raw material prices, contributed to an excellent performance from the 
team. Glasson supplies a wide range of raw materials to the feed compound 
industry as well as added value lines, including wild bird feeds and a range of 
smallholder feeds, to animal feed outlets. Its fertiliser blending operations have 
been very successful and, after the year end, we extended Glasson’s fertiliser 
activity by establishing a joint venture, which trades as “FertLink Ltd”. This new 
business, based in Birkenhead, near Liverpool, will supply fertiliser product both 
within the Group and to other wholesale accounts.
Arable Products
The Arable Division continued to gain momentum during the year. It has 
enjoyed the benefit of a full year’s trading from Woodheads Seeds, acquired 
in the prior financial year, in May 2010. The total volume of seed traded, 
including our pre-existing seed business, has been very encouraging and the 
enlarged activity now forms a very important strand of the Arable Division. 
With the addition of Woodheads Seeds, Wynnstay is recognised as a major 
supplier of cereal seeds and herbage seeds to the UK market.
In May 2011, the Group acquired Wrekin Grain, a grain marketing company, 
operating from Telford in Shropshire. Wrekin Grain has now been integrated 
with our long established grain marketing business, Shropshire Grain, to form 
GrainLink, a business with sufficient scale to create a national presence for 
Wynnstay in grain marketing. I am pleased to report that GrainLink made a 
good contribution in its first few months of trading and it provides a platform 
for further expansion in the arable sector. 
Group fertiliser volumes increased over last year and mirrored wider 
industry trends in the UK, with variable demand during the season.  This 
was closely aligned to weather conditions, particularly within the grassland 
areas. Demand for arable products was strong during the summer months, 
as farmers bought stocks ahead of likely price increases. Livestock farms 
generally have less storage capacity, therefore the recent price increases 
tempered sales during the autumn, however, this should be balanced by 
stronger demand in the spring. We continue to enjoy a strong relationship 
with GrowHow, the only UK manufacturer of ammonium nitrate.
54%
increase in revenue from 
our agricultural activities 12 13 www.wynnstay.co.uk Wynnstay Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011
Specialist	Retail
Our specialist retailing activities, comprising Wynnstay Stores and Just 
for Pets, performed well during the year. Revenues increased by 9% over 
2010 to £71.32 million and the profit contribution increased by 7% to £3.70 
million. Growth was driven by the ongoing store refurbishment programme 
at our country stores chain, Wynnstay Stores, and additional openings of our 
Just for Pets pet stores. 
Wynnstay Stores
Wynnstay Stores delivered another strong performance.  Like-for-like sales, 
adjusted for inflation, increased by 4% year on year, supported by high levels 
of non-discretionary spending by our farming customer base. Our wide range 
of products also attracts a broad cross-section of rural dwellers and these 
sales have been robust. Our store refurbishment programme continued 
during the year.  At Dolgellau in Gwynedd, we repositioned our store within 
its existing site in January 2011 and the store now provides an enhanced 
range of products in a much improved retail environment. At Welshpool 
in Powys, we have taken a site adjacent to the current store to expand 
the range of hardware products the store offers and at Oswestry we have 
relocated to a new flagship store. The site is much larger than the previous 
location and offers a full range of products including a larger gun room with 
an excellent range of products for country sports enthusiasts.
Our stores are recognised as an important source of products within their 
rural communities. Product knowledge is also a key aspect of our offering 
and all our stores have suitably qualified personnel (SQP) to provide 
guidance on animal pharmaceuticals. In addition, we continue to look for 
new products to offer our farming customer base, including the supply of 
alternative energy products.  
We continue to see our Wynnstay store chain, which total 28 stores, as 
providing a one stop shop for agricultural supplies for farmers as well as 
a useful resource for rural dwellers. Our ongoing store refurbishment 
programme is aimed at strengthening our offering and we will seek 
opportunities to expand the geography of the network further.
Youngs Animal Feeds Ltd, acquired in November 2009, has contributed well 
and is recognised as a leading supplier of equine products to a number of 
specialist outlets across the Midlands.
Just for Pets
Sales at our Just for Pets stores continued to grow, up 12% year on year 
reflecting our store opening programme. The pet product sector continues 
to show resilience against the wider retails sales trend and although 
like-for-like sales are down by 3%, we are particularly encouraged by the 
performance of the new stores. The first “easipetcare” veterinary concession 
was opened, in November 2010, at our Burton upon Trent store. A number 
of small pet clinics were established at selected stores during the year and 
we opened a second easipetcare concession at the Kidderminster store in 
December 2011.
We were pleased to receive another award from the Pet Care Trade Association 
during the year, when our Acocks Green store was voted “Favourite pet care 
retailer”. This follows our Malvern branch being voted “Retailer of the year” 
in 2010. These awards demonstrate the commitment of the business and 
Chief Executive’s Review	(continued)
staff to customer service, an approach which is apparent throughout all the 
stores and highly attractive to customers.
We relocated our distribution centre to a new facility at Hartlebury, 
Worcestershire, in September.  The move facilitates further expansion over 
the coming years as the chain continues to grow. There are plans for three 
new stores in 2012, the first of which will open at Yardley in the West 
Midlands in February. 
Joint	Ventures	&	Associate
Our joint ventures and associate businesses continue to contribute to the 
Group and have performed in line with management expectations. 
STAFF	
I would like to record my appreciation of the dedication and commitment 
of all personnel within the Group who are for us our most valuable 
“assets”. The Board is very grateful to all staff for their contribution to such  
strong results.
OUTLOOK
The agricultural industry is a strong and important part of the UK economy 
and the farming community is the Group’s largest customer base.  In the 
short term, there could be some pricing pressures for farmers mainly as 
a result of supermarkets’ commitment to provide essential items such as 
milk and bread at “value” levels. However, the long term outlook for the 
UK agricultural industry is very positive, especially for efficient producers 
in the sector.   
The breadth of our activities has been an important part of the Group’s ability 
to deliver sustainable growth over many years.  It also acts as a buttress 
against volatility in our markets caused by the effect of variable climatic 
conditions on world agricultural production. In addition, Wynnstay has a 
strong balance sheet, which will help to support our growth ambitions and 
as well as targeting organic expansion, we will continue to look for suitable 
complementary acquisitions.  We remain confident that the Group is well 
positioned for continued growth over the new financial year.
I look forward to updating all stakeholders further at our AGM in March.

TRADING	RESULTS
The Group’s trading performance has once again reached record levels in 
terms of revenues, profitability and earnings per share. The improved results 
are a combination of continued volume growth in core agricultural product 
groups and further positive contributions from acquisitions. Revenues have 
been exaggerated by considerable commodity price inflation across many of 
the Group’s main product categories. 
Group revenue was £346.18m (2010: £243.74m), of which £274.57m (2010: 
£178.02m) came from agricultural supplies, which included a contribution from 
the acquisition of Wrekin Grain Limited in May 2011. The precise value of this 
acquired revenue is unavailable because our existing grain trading business 
was hived into the acquired Company, which was renamed GrainLink Limited 
in July 2011, and the separate trading activities became indistinguishable, 
but a reasonable estimate, is £24.00m. The agricultural supplies business also 
includes a full contribution from Woodheads Seeds Ltd, which was acquired 
in May 2010. The revenue of this business in the first half of the year (for 
which period no comparative information has been included as it pre-dated 
the acquisition) amounted to £11.75m, making our estimate of the effect of 
acquisitions on the increase in the revenue of agricultural supplies in these 
results approximately £35.75m. Our retail operations produced revenue of 
£71.32m (2010: £65.47m) which included contributions from three additional 
Just for Pets stores opened during the year. The Group’s operating profit before 
contributions from our Joint Venture and Associate Company activities and 
non-cash charges relating to goodwill impairment and share based payments 
was up 15% at £7.51m (2010: £6.54m). After goodwill impairment and share 
based payments of £0.42m (2010: £0.47m) operating profit was up 17% at 
£7.09m (2010: £6.07m). With a gross contribution from our Joint Venture and 
Associate Company activities of £0.24m (2010: £0.26m), Group pre-tax profit 
before finance costs increased by 16% to £7.33m (2010: £6.33m), with the 
agricultural supplies businesses contributing £3.82m (2010: £3.00m) and the 
retail operations £3.70m (2010: £3.46m). Other activities contributed a loss 
of £0.19m (2010: £0.13m). After net finance costs of £0.39m (2010: £0.38m), 
Group pre-tax profit was £6.94m (2010: £5.95m).
Group Earnings before Interest, Tax, Depreciation & Amortisation (EBITDA) 
rose by 12% to £10.07m (2010: £9.00m).
TAxATION
The Group’s tax charge of £1.94m (2010: £1.71m) represented 27.9% (2010: 
28.8%) of the Group pre-tax profit, which was slightly higher than the pro-
rata standard rate for the period of 26.8%. This was primarily a result of 
depreciation charges on the Group’s freehold buildings not being eligible 
for capital allowances.
 
EARNINGS	PER	SHARE	&	DIVIDEND
Basic earnings per share was 30.23p (2010: 27.48p), based on a weighted 
average number of shares in issue during the year of 16.545m (2010: 15.400m), 
which represents an increase of 10%. The Board proposes to recommend the 
payment of a final dividend of 5.20p per share on the 30 April 2012, which 
when added to the interim dividend of 2.60p per share paid on the 31 October 
2011, makes a total of 7.80p for the year (2010: 7.10p), an increase of 9.9%. 
The total dividend is expected to be covered 3.85 times (2010: 3.87 times) by 
earnings, and continues the Board’s progressive dividend policy.
Finance Director’s Statement
The Group’s trading 
performance has once 
again reached record 
levels in terms of 
revenues, profitability and 
earnings per share
SHARE	CAPITAL	
The only shares issued during the year were to existing shareholders 
exercising their right to receive dividends in the form of new shares under 
the Company’s scrip dividend scheme. A total of 106,263 shares (2010: 
97,295) with an equivalent cash value of £0.368m (2010: £0.269m) were 
allotted in these issues. A small number of employee share options were 
exercised during the year and satisfied with existing shares already held by 
the Company’s Employee Share Ownership Trust.
BALANCE	SHEET
Group net assets at the year end amounted to £51.70m (2010: £47.37m), and 
based on the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year of 
16.545 million, this represented a net asset value per share of £3.12 (2010: 
£3.08). During the financial year the share price traded in a range between a 
low of £2.93 in December 2010 and a high of £3.78 in July 2011. 
Capital investment in fixed assets amounted to £3.36m (2010: £2.22m) and 
during the year, expenditure on new acquisitions, inclusive of acquired net 
cash / (debt), was £2.60m (2010: £4.09m). 
Commodity price inflation, particularly in feed raw materials and fertiliser 
products, has impacted the Group’s working capital requirements, with higher 
inventory and receivables values as a result of higher unit costs in addition to 
greater activity levels. Total inventory values increased by 31% to £23.69m 
(2010: £18.00m), with the acquisition of Wrekin Grain accounting for £0.8m 
of this increase. Trade and other receivables increased to £45.58m (2010: 
£36.00m) with the acquisition effectively responsible for around £5.60m of 
the increase after adjusting for the hive up of the existing Shropshire Grain 
activities into the merged business. The additional funding requirement 
was partly offset by an increase in trade and other payables which stood at 
£48.16m (2010: £36.58m) at the year end.  
CASHFLOW	&	NET	DEBT
The considerable working capital outflow mentioned above, which amounted 
to £4.34m (2010: £1.82m), saw net cash generated from operating activities 
reduce to £3.72m (2010: £4.77m). Total net cash investment, including

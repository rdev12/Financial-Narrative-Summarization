CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
The Innovation Group provides software and outsourcing services
to the insurance industry. Our vision is to provide technology and
best practice for the administration of policies and claims for the
world’s insurers and risk carriers. The Group is totally focused on this
market and delivers its two broad offerings through a single client-
centric organisation. We are a multinational player operating in the
world’s largest insurance markets with a strong proportion of our
clients being international in nature. Our 2,100 people across the
world have extensive insurance experience and they are ably
supported by our partners.
The year in review
During 2007 we continued to make strong progress in all aspects of
our business and have now completed the transition into a
technology-led outsourcing company with recurring revenue now
77% of the business. We delivered signiﬁcant growth in both revenue
and proﬁts reaching our highest ever levels on both counts and we
had strong cash generation with an operating cash inﬂow of £15.2m.
Client satisfaction is the underlying strength of our business and
these client relationships continued to prosper during the year.  
We extended our outsourcing relationships with existing clients and
also won new clients, including our largest ever outsourcing
transaction – a multi year agreement with Royal and Sun Alliance.
In addition, we secured three new recurring software licence projects,
two in the UK and one overseas including one in partnership with IBM.
In December 2006 we made the strategic acquisition of First Notice
Systems (“FNS”) which has provided the Group with an important
entry into the insurance outsourcing market in the USA. 
The integration of FNS has been extremely smooth and has exceeded
all of our internal expectations. The acquisition was funded by a 2 for
5 Rights issue of 180,600,771 new Ordinary Shares to raise
approximately £37.9m (before expenses). In addition, we made six
smaller acquisitions to further extend the reach of the Group. 
In South Africa we secured our status as a Black Economic
Empowered (“BEE”) supplier within that country by introducing a
qualifying equity partner which is majority owned by an employee
trust.
Since the year end we completed the acquisition of Nobilas Claims
and Fleet Solutions Limited (“Nobilas”), the accident management
business of Akzo Nobel, which expands our European footprint into
France, Benelux and Spain and also takes us into the fleet
management and leasing markets. This acquisition joins our existing
Motorcare operations to give us a truly pan-European offering.
Financial results
Revenue for the year ended 30 September 2007 was £110.5m (2006:
£79.7m); recurring revenues increased from £55.4m to £85.0m and
now represent 77% of the total revenue. Outsourcing revenue was
£75.4m (2006: £48.3m) and software and services revenue was
£35.1m (2006: £31.3m). 
Adjusted proﬁt* for the year ended 30 September 2007 was £16.1m
(2006: £10.9m) and profit before tax was £10.4m (2006: £8.5m),
representing adjusted EPS of 1.93p (2006: 1.64p) and basic EPS of
1.17p (2006: 1.28p).
Operating cash flow for the year ended 30 September 2007 was
£15.2m (2006: £10.0m).
The ﬁnancial results for the year are impacted by the strength of
Sterling against, in particular, the US Dollar and the South African
Rand.
*Adjusted proﬁt before tax is proﬁt before tax after adding back the
amortisation charge of £2.9m, impairment charge of £1.1m, a share
based payments charge of £1.5m and utilisation of pre-acquisition
brought forward tax losses of £0.2m as analysed on the face of the
income statement.

Organisation and employees
I would like to pay tribute to the outstanding teamwork and
commitment to clients displayed by our employees during the year .
I would also like to extend a warm welcome to our new recruits and
to partners’ employees who are working with us on client
engagements. During the year we increased our headcount from
1,400 to 2,100 and with the integration of Nobilas this has increased
to 2,300. Innovation continues to attract and retain some of the best
people in the industry and we recognise them as the foundation of
our future success.
The Board and corporate governance
I am pleased to welcome Kurt Lauk and James Morley to the roster
of Non-Executive Directors. Kurt brings considerable global
experience in both the automotive and technology industries, whilst
James has signiﬁcant ﬁnancial and operational experience in the
insurance industry. Chris Banks and David Thorpe continue as Non-
Executive Directors and Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration
committees respectively and I remain as Non-Executive Chairman
of the Board. In line with best practice, I no longer sit on the Audit
and Remuneration Committees but continue to chair the Nomination
Committee. 
Paul Smolinski resigned as Group Finance Director on 31 January
2007. John Sidwell joined the Board as Group Finance Director on 19
March 2007 and resigned on 21 May 2007. Paul Hemsley, who had
been interim Finance Director since December 2006, then joined the
Board as Group Finance Director on 22 May 2007. 
With the exception of the Chairman’s seat on the Audit and
Remuneration Committees until 5 May 2007, the Group has been in
full compliance with the provisions of the Combined Code throughout
the year .
Dividend policy
As advised in our interim statement we have reviewed our dividend
policy and have decided to recommend a ﬁnal dividend of 0.3 pence
per share. This dividend will be proposed at the Annual General
Meeting on 13 March 2008 and if approved paid on 28 March 2008.
The record date is 29 February 2008.
Outlook
The Board is very pleased with the progress of the business and is
encouraged by the current high level of demand for its services
across the globe. This demand, supported by an encouraging pipeline
of prospects and higher than expected levels of future recurring
revenue, led the Group to revise upwards its expectations for 2008. 
We have robust recurring revenue models in both the outsourcing and
software segments. We have an extensive outsourcing client base and
the pipelines remain healthy in each geography. We anticipate growth
to continue in 2008 through our simple objective of delivering more
beneﬁts, to more clients, in more markets. Software licence sales still
remain attractive and we have a better business model through
which to manage the volatility of software licence revenue. Our ﬁve
year relationship with IBM gives us the platform to distribute our
software products on a global basis. We made good progress with IBM
in 2007 and we anticipate seeing further results from this partnership
in the 2008 ﬁnancial year .
In summary, the Group is well positioned as we enter 2008. We aim
to continue the momentum gained throughout 2007 and look forward
to the future with optimism.

RELIABILITY THAT 
MAKES A DIFFERENCE
Innovation Group is our principal outsourcing partner 
and we have had an excellent working relationship with 
Innovation Motorcare for over ten years. The work that 
they do for us in handling our repair claims, containing 
our costs and in conﬁguring bespoke solutions is key 
to the ongoing success of our business.

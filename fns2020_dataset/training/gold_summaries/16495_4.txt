ValiRx Timeline
VAL101
VAL101 is a novel therapeutic based on the Company’s 
proprietary GeneICE (Gene Inactivation by chromatin 
engineering) platform, which attracted a €1.2m 
Eurostars grant to fund its development. It acts to target 
and switch “OFF” the gene that expresses Bcl-2, a protein 
that is implicated in about half of all carcinomas. Bcl-2 
inhibits the critical process of apoptosis (programmed 
cell death), which prevents cancer development. Thus, 
because of its function in anti-apoptosis, the Bcl-2 gene 
has become a major target in the development of new, 
superior anticancer therapies. Pre-clinical studies 
have established VAL101’s efficacy in prostate, 
ovarian and pancreatic cancers, and may also 
have anti-tumour activity against orphan 
oncologic indications.
VAL201
VAL201 is a novel peptide for the treatment of 
hormone refractory prostate cancer and also other 
indications of hormone induced unregulated growth 
including endometriosis. These conditions have major 
unmet clinical needs and the personalised approach 
provided by VAL201 promises to significantly improve 
treatment outcomes. Pre-clinical studies conducted in 
collaboration with Oxford University have also established 
that this compound has the potential to reduce side 
effects as it leaves other hormone-induced activities 
working normally.
ValiRx was awarded a grant 
of £270,000 by the UK’s 
Government Technology 
Strategy Board under the 
Eurostars scheme.
ValiRx secured a global 
distribution agreement for 
diagnostic subsidiary ValiBio 
with US based Bioﬁeld and 
secured €600,000 from 
the sale.
ValiRx signed a full 
license agreement with 
Chroma Therapeutics Ltd to 
commercialise a non-invasive 
diagnostic technology patent 
developed by Chroma. 
ValiRx was admitted onto the 
AIM following the successful 
reverse take-over of Azure 
Holdings plc. The company’s 
valuation on admission was 
£12.8m based on an opening 
share price of 1.45p per share.
We have three advanced divisional companies, ValiPharma, ValiFinn 
and ValiMedix. Their technologies can be applied to numerous other 
ﬁelds and together they make up ValiRx.
Currently, ValiPharma has two lead drug candidates in late stage 
pre-clinical development for three indicators, two of which are: Corporate Governance Business Overview Financial Statements

ValBiomarkers
ValiFinn’s specialist competency lies in epigenomics, 
a rapidly advancing field that enables pairing a prognostic 
and/or predictive biomarker with a targeted drug. This 
is a key part of personalised medicine, particularly in 
cancer patients. The Company is actively discovering, 
developing, and validating functional biomarkers with high 
specificity and sensitivity from its 5 families of patents and 
patent applications and related intellectual property. These 
are diagnostic markers of inhibition of signalling pathways, 
which are target sites for novel drugs to treat cancer, and 
predictive markers of disease progression.
SELFCheck
ValiMedix was established in 2009 to exploit the 
growing “well being” market through the marketing 
and distribution of reagent-based home screening 
tests under the brand SELFCheck. These tests are 
designed to have high sensitivity and specificity to 
detect levels or the presence of a range of biological 
markers e.g. PSA – prostate specific antigen; FSH 
– follicle stimulating hormone; H Pylori antibodies, 
that may be indicators of disease.
Successful placing to raise 
£2.9m will allow VAL201 
to enter into in-human 
clinical trials.
ValiMedix entered into a UK 
distribution agreement with 
First Health Products Limited 
for the distribution and sale 
of ValiRx’s SELFCheck health 
screening products in the UK.
ValiMedix Ltd became 
the exclusive supplier of 
the SELFCheck brand of 
Personal Health Screening 
Tests, which became 
increasingly available in 
pharmacies throughout 
the UK.
ValiRx announced that 
its human papilloma virus 
(HPV) smear test to detect 
the onset of cervical cancer 
in women begun clinical 
sample validation.

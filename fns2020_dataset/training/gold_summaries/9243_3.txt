Chairman’s statement
Strategy
Laird is a leader in the global
electronics and security systems
markets. With the successful disposal
of Laird Plastics in October 2004 the
Group is now focused on its two core
divisions, Laird T echnologies and Laird
Security Systems. Our aim is to deliver
proﬁtable growth by the development
and strengthening of these two
businesses, building a competitive
edge through innovation and technical
expertise, customer service and low
cost manufacturing. We focus on
specialist markets providing
opportunities for growth and where
our global reach and ﬁnancial strength
give us considerable advantages over
our competitors. Our growing
presence in Asia and Central Europe
provides proximity to our customers in
those regions as well as a lower cost
supply base. The Laird strategy is one
driven by the overriding objective of
creating and enhancing shareholder
value, today and for the future. 2004
marked further progress in the
successful implementation of this
strategy, with the refocusing of the
Group to higher growth markets and
the delivery of another year of strong
growth. 
Delivering Strong Proﬁts and Earnings
Growth
In 2004, we again delivered strong
proﬁts and earnings growth, with both
of our divisions, Laird T echnologies
and Laird Security Systems, once
more increasing their turnover and
operating proﬁts. We achieved this
despite the adverse translation effects
of exchange rate movements. We also
successfully completed the
divestment of Laird Plastics and this,
together with the acquisition of
Centurion Wireless T echnologies in
particular , continued our repositioning
of the Group to higher growth
markets. Group proﬁts for 2004,
before exceptional items, goodwill
amortisation and tax, were £47.1
million, 26% up on the £37.4 million
reported in 2003 and 37% up at
constant exchange rates. Earnings
per share on a similar basis were
25.9 pence, up 20% on the 21.6 pence
in 2003 and 30% up at constant
exchange rates. 
Continuing Dividend Growth
In light of the strong results for 2004
your Board is recommending a ﬁnal
dividend of 6.05 pence per share. This
will provide a total dividend for the
year of 9.2 pence per share, compared
with 8.6 pence per share for 2003 and
represents an increase of 7%.
Board Development
Mark Smith, Deputy Chairman and
senior independent Non-Executive
Director , retired from the Board at the
Annual General Meeting in May 2004,
after ten years as a Director . He was
succeeded as senior independent
Non-Executive Director by David
Morton. David will himself retire from
the Board at the Annual General
Meeting in May 2005, after seven
years as a Director , and will be
succeeded as senior independent
Non-Executive Director by
John McDowall CBE. I would like to
thank Mark and David for their
valuable service and extensive
contribution to the development of the
Group. In September 2004 the Board
was strengthened with the
appointments of Anthony Reading and
Andrew Robb as Non-Executive
Directors. Anthony Reading, who was
until recently an Executive Director of
T omkins plc and Chairman and CEO
of T omkins Corporation USA, will
become Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee in
May 2005. Andrew Robb was until
recently an Executive Director of
Pilkington plc, having previously been
Finance Director , and on his
appointment to the Board became
Chairman of the Audit Committee.
In January 2005 the Board was
strengthened further with the
appointment of Martin Rapp, President
and CEO of Laird T echnologies, as an
Executive Director .
Our Employees
Laird employs some 8,500 people of
great diversity, with many different
nationalities and cultures worldwide.
The progress that we have
demonstrated during the year has
been made possible through their
dedication and efforts and the
successes they have achieved. Their
energy and their commitment to
serving our customers are critical to
what makes Laird a successful and
growing Group, and I would like to
take this opportunity to thank them all.
Being a Good Corporate Citizen
All companies today exist in a climate
demanding high standards of
corporate responsibility,
encompassing good governance and
careful management. T oday’s leading
companies must demonstrate
excellence and commitment in these
constantly evolving areas.
Considerable work has been
undertaken to ensure that the Group
meets these challenges. The Group is
also in compliance with all aspects of
the new Combined Code which
became effective in 2004. This is
expanded upon in the Corporate
Governance section later in this
Report. We have continued to engage
our shareholders in full and open
dialogue through an active investor
relations programme. 
We believe that it is important for us
to be good corporate citizens in the
many different locations and
environments in which we work. This
is reinforced through our Group
policies on Ethics, on Health, Safety
and the Environment and on
Employment, and through an ongoing
commitment at the local level. This is
evidenced by the majority of our main
manufacturing facilities being ISO
9001 or ISO 9000 certiﬁed, with their
demanding standards of quality and
safety. In 2004, 16 of our facilities were
accredited to the ISO 14001 standard,
with its additional environmental
requirements, and all of our main
manufacturing facilities will be
certiﬁed to this standard during the
course of this year . Further details of
our activities in all of these areas are
given later in this Report.
Maintaining the Momentum
2004 was another year of signiﬁcant
progress, marked by the further
successful strategic repositioning of
the Group, the continued
strengthening and development of our
two market-leading businesses, and
the delivery of another year of strong
proﬁts and earnings growth. The
strategy we have in place, the strength
of our businesses and the actions we
continue to take leave us well
positioned to maintain the momentum
and leadership position we have
achieved for the Group and we look
forward to making further progress
in 2005.

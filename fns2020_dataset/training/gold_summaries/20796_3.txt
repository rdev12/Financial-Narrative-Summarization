Developments
This year marks Alumasc’s 30
th
 anniversary  
as a public company. For the past thirty years, 
our Annual Report, including my statement 
as Chairman, has covered a diverse group of 
small businesses, operating in several unrelated 
sectors. This year, following the sale of Dyson 
Diecastings, its last remaining engineering 
subsidiary, Alumasc’s continuing business  
now operates within a single market sector.
This concentration of activity within building 
and construction is the outcome of a strategy 
to focus resource where our strengths lie and 
to exchange the historic resilience of diversity 
for the greater possibilities of building on a 
winning formula, while continually developing 
our skills and sharing best practice. This 
approach is discussed in greater detail in  
the Chief Executive’s Review that follows.
In order to counter the resultant risk of 
exposure to a single industry and its cycles, 
we endeavour to direct each business towards 
sectoral opportunities where demand is 
expected to outstrip the industry benchmark 
and to seek opportunities to introduce our 
products and services to new geographic 
markets judged to hold potential. This is not 
a new endeavour; however, it has required 
patience and investment. We believe that it 
has already delivered results during the difficult 
years that followed the financial crisis and,  
with greater focus, will yield greater rewards  
in future years.
Performance
Importantly, Alumasc has delivered another 
strong performance in the review year to 
30 June 2016, with our continuing business 
progressing for the fifth consecutive year. 
The group’s underlying profit before tax from 
continuing operations grew by 7%, from  
£7.7 million to £8.3 million, and statutory profit 
before tax by 59% to £7.7 million. Our balance 
sheet was already strong as a result of this 
improving performance and, following the sale 
of Dyson Diecastings in June, included net cash 
balances of £8.6 million at the year end.
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 
3.8 pence per share (2015: 3.5 pence), to give 
a total of 6.5 pence for the year. This represents 
an increase of 8% over the previous year  
(6.0 pence) and is 2.8 times covered by  
basic earnings per share of 18.2 pence.
Future development
Despite the transformation referred to above 
from diversity to greater focus, Alumasc 
remains a family of specialist businesses,  
each dedicated to satisfying specialist demands 
with specific, frequently bespoke, solutions.

Strategic Focus 
Alumasc is now a strategically focused 
building products group
Building Products order book (£m)
The more we succeed, by providing outstanding 
service to discriminating customers, the more 
we can expect to win market share and grow 
our revenues. Innovation is a vital contributor  
to this process and remains high on the agenda 
of all our businesses. 
In the past, the diversity of our group may have 
provided a buffer against individual sectoral 
decline and cycles but limited opportunity for 
intra-group collaboration. The nuanced market 
focus of our continuing businesses still provides 
a degree of diversity within the sector but one 
where opportunities and best practice can 
frequently be shared. 
These two points – innovation and evolving best 
practice – give our strategy a distinctly ‘organic’ 
flavour, which we view as a strength. The 
complementary strength of our balance sheet, 
and the operational focus on margin and cash 
generation, also provides us with the wherewithal 
to supplement organic growth by acquisition. 
We will be on the lookout for such opportunities, 
where they complement the market focus that 
has been achieved in recent years.
Prospects
Alumasc ended the year to June 2016 with 
positive momentum and with rising order books, 
which have continued to grow since the year 
end to record levels, both positive indicators 
for the new financial year. A major contributor 
to the growth in order books is the success of 
Levolux in the United States, where patient 
groundwork has begun to yield tangible results. 
There are also signs of recovery in the scheduling 
of larger projects, following a quieter period 
during the past year, which will benefit the  
latter part of our new financial year and beyond.
More generally, it is still too close to the June 
referendum to predict with confidence any 
consequential change in prospects for the  
wider economy. 
We assess the impact on our business of the 
fall in Sterling to be limited at current levels 
and our businesses have not detected any 
significant change in demand for their  
products and services. 
At this moment, therefore, given the 
encouraging fundamentals outlined above, 
we continue to believe that Alumasc can 
outperform its underlying markets and that the 
group is well positioned to adapt to reality as 
necessary, with the expectation of achieving 
further progress both short and longer term.

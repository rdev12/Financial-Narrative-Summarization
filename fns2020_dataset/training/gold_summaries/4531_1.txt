Section 2 the Business Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2009
there is no denying that 2009 was a challenging year but i believe
that at Debenhams we met those challenges head on and we are a
stronger business as a result. Our good performance stems from our
attention to detail in all aspects of our business: improving the
design, quality and value of our products; enhancing the customer
experience through both brand rationalisation and instore upgrades;
introducing exciting new own bought brands to target specific
customer segments; and keeping tight control of resources in a
difficult market environment.
Review of theY ear
Market Conditions
2009 was characterised by a high degree of volatility arising out of
wider economic factors and the ﬁnancial year coincided with the worst
of the “credit crunch” period almost in its entirety.trading in the ﬁrst
half in particular was inﬂuenced by high proﬁle collapses in the
ﬁnancial services sector which negatively impacted an already fragile
consumer confidence.
however, the important
Christmas trading
period held up
reasonably well. there
were a number of
competing inﬂuences on
consumer conﬁdence in
the second half. On the
negative side, concerns
over unemployment
depressed confidence.
On the positive side,
lower mortgage payments due to record low interest rates and
lower household energy and fuel bills gave rise to higher disposable
income for some consumers. in the Republic of ireland, trading
conditions were difﬁcult throughout the year in light of the sharp
economic decline.
Financial Performance
Debenhams delivered a strong ﬁnancial performance in 2009,
despite the difﬁcult trading environment with increases in gross
transaction value (Gtv), market share, gross margin and proﬁt. Gross
transaction value was 0.2 per cent higher than the previous year
at £2,339.7 million. Market share gains were achieved throughout the
year (source:tNsworldpanel fashion 24 weeks market share data to
13 september 2009 vs. 2008).
During the last quarter of the year, the largest space moves in
Debenhams’ history commenced, which resulted in c530,000 sq ft of
trading space being converted from concession to own bought ranges.
As expected, this programme caused disruption to sales in the latter
part of the year and like-for-like sales for the year were 3.6 per cent
lower than last year.the shortfall in like-for-like sales was more than
offset by a strong gross margin performance which improved
signiﬁcantly as the year progressed.
Gross margin increased by 70 basis points over last year. this was
driven by higher own bought sales and an ongoing focus on the drivers
of cash proﬁt, including the tight management of costs and stocks and
historically low terminal stock levels which resulted in lower markdown
in sale periods. the adverse impact of sterling’s deﬂation against the
us dollar was reduced to a considerable degree by the Company’s
hedging policy.
headline proﬁt before tax and amortisation from capitalised bank
fees was £125.2 million, an increase of 13.7 per cent over the
£110.1 million achieved last year. Proﬁt before tax of £120.8 million
grew by 14.1 per cent (2008: £105.9 million). eBitDA increased by
3.6 per cent from £268.8 million in 2008 to £278.5 million in 2009.
Basic earnings per share (949 million weighted
average shares in issue following the capital raising)
of 10.0 pence compared with 9.0 pence last year
(860 million weighted average shares in issue).
Cash ﬂow from operating activities before
ﬁnancing, tax and interest during the year was
£156.5 million compared with £160.2 million
a year ago.
the scheduled £100.0 million amortisation
payment of the term loan was made in May 2009
from cash ﬂow. in June 2009, Debenhams raised £303.8 million net
through a placing and open offer capital raising. subsequently, a
£50.0 million pre-payment against the £150.0 million amortisation
payment due in May 2010 was made. A further £61.4 million of debt
was bought back in the market at an average discount of 5.6 per cent.
As a result, net debt at the year end on 29 August 2009 was £590.3
million.this was an improvement of £403.7 million over the position
at the start of the ﬁnancial year.

undertaken throughout our business
over the past couple of years. ”

KPI
Gtv is a measure of overall sales growth for the
business, including concession sales.the board
believes it represents a good guide to the overall
activity of the Company.
Gtv grew by 0.2 per cent during 2009, with
increases from new department stores and
international stores more than offsetting the
like-for-like sales decline.

Like-fOR-Like (LfL)sALes (%)
LfL sales provide a measure of annual sales
performance from stores that have been open
for one year or more.this metric is therefore
an indication of organic sales growth.
LfL sales declined by 3.6 per cent in 2009.
As expected, the extensive space moves which took
place in the fourth quarter caused disruption to LfL
sales in that period which has inﬂuenced the result
for the year.

PBt is the board’s principal measure of proﬁtability.
we use the headline number (which adds back
amortisation on capitalised bank fees) as this is the
metric favoured by the ﬁnancial markets.
headline PBt increased by 13.7 per cent in 2009.
the board believes this is a creditable performance
given the extremely difﬁcult retail and economic
environment which prevailed throughout the period.
tRADiNG sPACe (m sq ft)
the biggest driver of trading space is new store
openings. Our disciplined approach to capital
expenditure for new stores ensures we generate
strong returns from new space.
trading space increased by 342,000 sq ft (3.1 per
cent) in 2009 with the addition of ﬁve new stores
and a sizeable extension to the Cardiff store.
PeRCeNtAGe Of OwN BOuGht sALes (%)
Own bought sales produce higher margins than
concession sales. increasing the percentage of own
bought sales to take advantage of these higher
margins is an important part of Debenhams’ strategy.
the percentage of own bought sales increased from
71.8 per cent in 2008 to 76.0 per cent in 2009 largely
driven by the introduction of new own bought ranges
and departments, expansion of existing brands and
higher own bought mix in new stores.
LABOuR tuRNOveR (%) ChANGe
Attracting and retaining talented, motivated employees
is an important part of Debenhams’ ability to succeed.
Change in labour turnover is a measure of our ability
to retain staff, although it is always likely to be
impacted by macroeconomic factors.
Labour turnover fell signiﬁcantly in 2009.
Although the difﬁcult economic climate and high
unemployment levels have depressed the overall
labour market, we have taken positive action
to increase employee retention.

Brand and Product Strategy
Debenhams gained market share throughout the year. in the most
recently available data for the uk, Debenhams’ total market share in
clothing, footwear and accessories increased by 10 basis points (source
for all market share data: TnS Worldpanel fashion 24 weeks market
share data to 13 September 2009 vs. 2008).the strongest market share
performances were delivered by menswear (up 20 basis points) and
childrenswear (up 40 basis points). womenswear market share for the
period was ﬂat and was impacted by weak concession performance
and the disruption to sales in the fourth quarter
from space moves. Debenhams has continued to
gain a greater share of the market over the past
two years and customers have responded
positively to the signiﬁcant improvements made
to the design, quality and value of Debenhams’
own bought products, as well as an enhanced
shopping experience on the back of improved
instore presentation.
Own bought products accounted for 76.0 per
cent of sales in 2009, up from 71.8 per cent last year and in line with
the strategic aim to increase the own bought product mix.the increase
in own bought mix was largely driven by the introduction of a number
of new own bought ranges and departments, the expansion of some
existing brands both in terms of trading space and product breadth
and higher own bought mix in new stores.
Designers at Debenhams made a strong contribution to sales
during 2009 of some £432 million, an increase of 11.4 per cent over
the prior year. Overall, own bought sales increased by 3.4 per cent.
the weakest category was concessions which overall saw sales decline
by 16.5 per cent.
t owards the end of ﬁnancial year 2009, a major programme of space
moves commenced which was completed by the end of september
2009. in total, c530,000 sq ft of trading space was converted
from concessions to own bought. this included the loss of
c215,000 sq ft from womenswear concessions (including Principles),
c200,000 sq ft from home concessions and c120,000 sq ft from
women’s accessories concessions.the largest increases in own bought
space were womenswear (c165,000 sq ft), sports and leisure (c140,000
sq ft), women’s accessories (c120,000 sq ft) and childrenswear
(c60,000 sq ft).
New ranges introduced during 2009 include Butterﬂy by Matthew
williamson and Mantaray in womenswear, Bluezoo in childrenswear,
sports and leisure for women, men and children and Ben de Lisi in
home. Although it is early days as many of these brands were launched
during the fourth quarter of the year, initial reactions from customers
have been very positive.
in March, a quantity of stock and ﬁxtures and ﬁttings was acquired
from the administrators of Principles, as well as a licence to trade the
brand through that stock.this was done to ensure continuity of supply
to Debenhams through the spring/summer season.
Stock Management
stock levels were managed tightly during the year.t erminal stock was
at a historically low level at year end of 2.7 per cent, arising mainly
from very aggressive
discounting in the post-
Christmas sale. At year
end, total stock was 14.1
per cent higher than the
previous year, of which
10.0% related to the
increase in own bought
space allocation. Like-
for-like stock density
decreased by 5.1%.
Store Portfolio
At the end of 2009, the store portfolio consisted of 144 department
stores and ten Desire stores. the total trading space of the portfolio
was 11,046,000 sq ft, an increase of 3.1 per cent since the start of
the year.
five new stores were opened during the year.these were: Livingston
(60,000 sq ft) in August 2008; westﬁeld London (109,000 sq ft),
wrexham (60,000 sq ft) and Great yarmouth (20,000 sq ft) all in
October 2008; and Bury st edmunds (59,000 sq ft) in March 2009.
Overall, new stores have performed in line with or ahead of expectations.
the new store pipeline for 2010 is secure with six new stores adding
a total of 300,000 sq ft of trading space.two of these stores have now
opened: kidderminster Desire in september 2009 and Monks Cross
Desire in October 2009.

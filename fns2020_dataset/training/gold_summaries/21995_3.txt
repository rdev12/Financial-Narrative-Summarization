 Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Brooks Macdonald Group plc
2
This has been a year of 
significant change, in 
which we have made large 
investments in the Group’s 
future, maintained our 
profits and grown  
our discretionary funds 
under management.
Profit before tax has risen marginally to 
£10.6m, in line with expectations. Earnings 
per share have risen to 69.01p.
The board is recommending a final dividend 
of 19.0p per share which, if approved by 
shareholders, will result in total dividends for 
the year of 26.0p. This represents an increase 
of 16% over the total dividends paid last year 
of 22.5p per share. The final dividend will be 
paid on 28 October 2014 to shareholders 
who are on the register at the close of 
business on 26 September 2014.
Richard Price joined us as a non-executive 
director in August. He is a former partner in 
KPMG and brings us the benefit of his 
considerable experience and expertise in the 
financial services industry.
DPZ Capital Limited (‘DPZ’) became part of 
the Group in April 2014 and now forms part 
of Brooks Macdonald International, based in 
Jersey. This acquisition added £360m of 
discretionary funds under management and 
brings further scale and skill sets to our 
existing offshore offering. After the year end 
we completed the acquisition of Levitas 
Investment Management Services Limited 
(‘Levitas’), further expanding our Funds 
business and also our exposure in the 
growing field of pensions fund 
management, largely stemming from the 
Government’s auto enrolment initiative.
Our discretionary funds under management 
grew strongly over the year and as at  
30 June 2014 totalled £6.55bn (2013: 
£5.11bn), a rise of 28%. Net of the DPZ 
acquisition this represents a rise of over 
21%, compared to the WMA Balanced 
index that grew by 6.2% over the year.
As well as this increase in discretionary funds 
under management we also saw growth in 
all parts of the Group. Advisory assets 
increased to over £450m (2013: £348m), 
property assets under administration grew 
to £1.13bn (2013: £1.04bn) and third party 
assets under administration grew to £200m 
(2013: £140m).
In addition to the acquisitions mentioned 
above the Group has continued to grow 
organically with a combination of strong 
new business flow and by providing risk 
adjusted returns for our clients. We expect 
to continue to invest in the future of the 
business – in further development of our IT 
systems and in our investment and wealth 
management process. The strength of our 
brand and the professionalism of our staff, 
coupled with the continued investment in 
the business to which I have referred, enable 
us to look forward with confidence.

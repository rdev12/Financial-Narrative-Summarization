DEVRO’S BUSINESS AT A GLANCE
Our business model
Our business process
Extracting Collagen
Collagen used for casing is taken from 
the hides of carefully selected animals 
– officially approved for human 
consumption.
Applied Technology
The production of collagen casing is a 
complex technological process. Devro 
combines expertise and innovation to 
produce casings that allow our 
customers to make better sausage.
Manufacture 
Devro is a world leader in the 
manufacturing technology of this  
highly sophisticated process. Our 
casings are consistent, reliable and 
versatile to suit the needs of both 
sausage manufacturers and  
consumer preferences.
Why our business exists
Devro’s collagen casings are used to 
manufacture all varieties of sausage. 
Historically, animal intestines were  
used as casings for sausage, but over 
the past 50 years the use of collagen 
casing has increased, as it enables food 
manufacturers to automate production 
and reduce costs. It is better suited  
to contemporary food hygiene and 
traceability requirements, and technical 
specifications can be determined  
in advance. 
What our customers do
Devro’s customers manufacture  
branded and own-label sausage 
products worldwide, reaching 
consumers through retail and food 
service outlets.
How we create value
Devro creates value by converting a  
basic raw material, collagen, from the 
inner layer of cattle and sow hides, into  
a homogeneous gel and extruding it to 
tightly controlled dimensions, before 
being compressed and packed for supply 
to customers. Devro’s manufacturing 
processes are unique, evolved over  
many years of technical development. 
Who we sell to
Devro’s revenue comes primarily from 
the sale of collagen products directly 
to food manufacturers and, in some 
markets, local distributors. Devro sells to 
over 1,500 customers in more than 100 
countries, with a product range in excess 
of 500 individual items, covering eight 
principal types of application. 
Approximately one-third of Devro’s sales 
are in emerging markets and two-thirds 
are in developed markets. Over 100 
Devro employees work in customer-
facing operations as sales and technical 
advisers.

continents in over 100 countries. We sell 
directly to food manufacturers and via

Customer Products  
to Consumers
Devro’s innovation and casing 
performance allow our customers to 
produce differentiated products for  
the consumer. Our casings consistently 
score highly for appearance, colour, bite 
and overall acceptance in independent 
research and consumer testing.
The market we are in
Devro is one of five significant global 
producers of collagen casings in the 
world market, with a number of smaller 
local or regional competitors. Additional 
value is created for the customer  
by collaborating with specialist food 
machinery manufacturers and suppliers 
of food ingredients, to optimise  
product performance.
What makes us different
Devro differentiates itself from 
competitors by developing innovative 
new products, by working closely  
with customers to enhance their 
manufacturing efficiencies, and by 
providing high-quality technical  
support to customers.
Why our customers 
choose Devro
Getting the balance
To satisfy our customers’ 
demands, we use our knowledge 
of how to manipulate the  
complex chemistry of collagen  
to balance the requirements  
of food producers for  
strength and size stability  
with consumer preferences  
for tenderness and bite.

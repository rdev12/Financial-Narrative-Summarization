 CERES POWER HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2008

Chairman’s Statement
Business overview
I was delighted to assume the 
Chairmanship of Ceres Power in 
January and it is a great pleasure to 
report the Group’s first full year results 
since I took on the role.
As reported in the interim results, this year 
has been a period of transformation  
for Ceres Power in all aspects of the 
business. We signed a major supply and 
distribution agreement with British Gas  
in January which includes a volume 
forward order for the mass market 
uptake of residential Combined Heat 
and Power (CHP) products in the UK.  
In addition, Centrica plc (owner of British 
Gas) became a major new shareholder 
acquiring a stake of approximately  
10% for £20 million. These developments 
demonstrate the confidence both 
companies have in Ceres Power’s 
technology to enable British Gas 
customers to generate cheap,  
reliable, low-carbon electricity in  
their own homes.
The Group has also received 
independent confirmation of the  
core technology performance this  
year and successfully demonstrated  
its wall-mountable CHP product. This  
is capable of generating most of the 
electricity and all of the hot water and 
central heating required for a typical UK 
home. Ceres Power’s unique fuel cell 
technology enables the product to 
match daily and seasonal energy 
demands all year round, substantially 
reducing the need to buy electricity.  
It is manufactured using low-cost 
materials and is designed to produce 
total annual energy savings of around 
25% for consumers. Finally, we have  
also set out and communicated to  
the market our plan to deliver our  
CHP product into the UK market in 2011 
and I am delighted to report that we 
have met the Fuel Cell Module size, 
weight and performance targets. The 
Board and management team are fully 
committed to the delivery of this plan 
which we are convinced will enhance 
shareholder value.
The UK Government has estimated that 
microgeneration products, such as fuel 
cell CHP, have the potential to supply 
over one-third of the country’s total 
electricity needs and help meet its 
environmental obligations. Recent 
research commissioned by the UK 
Government has shown that fuel cell 
CHP has the potential to become the 
microgeneration ‘system of choice’, 
replacing the condensing boiler.
The Ceres Power CHP product is  
based on patented technology that  
is specifically designed for residential 
use – wall-mountable and a similar  
size and shape to existing domestic 
boilers. The units from the Alpha  
phase of our CHP product agreement 
with British Gas will be completed by  
the end of 2008 and we have outlined 
a clear roadmap to take the product  
to volume launch. 
During the year, the Group delivered 
strong growth in commercial  
revenues and continued to invest  
in manufacturing facilities, intellectual 
property and the recruitment of 
experienced employees. The Group’s 
balance sheet remains strong with  
£27.5 million in cash, providing a strong 
financial base from which we can 
continue to develop the business.
Using every unit 
of energy as 
efficiently as 
possible has to 
be our ultimate 
ambition

Energy efficiency 
In addressing climate change, 
renewables are only a partial solution  
in an environment of rising energy costs, 
energy demand and international 
pressure for sustainable economic 
growth. The UK has agreed to contribute 
to the EU’s target for renewables by 2020. 
The Government has stated that energy 
efficiency is the starting point of its 
energy policy, since this can reduce  
the amount of renewable energy 
needed to meet targets by reducing 
overall consumption.
Microgeneration products such as 
residential CHP create electricity at the 
point of use and are highly efficient 
compared with centralised power 
stations, avoiding the heat losses in 
generation and transmission. Ceres 
Power fuel cell CHP products use existing 
infrastructure, unlike renewables, and 
could make a significant contribution to 
meeting energy targets and delivering 
energy savings to consumers.
Improving energy performance in  
homes will play a particularly important 
role. Investing in microgeneration will be 
an important tool in tackling the carbon 
impact of the built environment. 
We welcome the UK Government’s 
acknowledgement that there is the 
potential to encourage more rapid 
uptake of microgeneration products 
through fiscal incentives, building 
regulations and the development  
of appropriate policies. 
People
I would like to thank Philip Holbeche 
who retired as Executive Chairman  
and John Gunn who stepped down  
as Non-Executive Director for their 
substantial contributions to the 
successful development of the Group. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
wish both Philip and John every success 
in their future endeavours.
We were extremely pleased to welcome 
Sir David Brown and Alan Wood as  
Non-Executive Directors of the Group  
in February 2008. As Ceres progresses 
towards mass market delivery of its 
products, their experience in high 
growth technology businesses as 
Chairmen of Motorola UK and  
Siemens UK respectively will be 
invaluable in helping the Group  
build shareholder value. 
The Group continues to build its 
experienced high calibre team to meet 
the challenging targets that the Group 
has set itself. The success of the business 
depends on the hard work and 
commitment of all of its employees  
and on behalf of the Board I would  
like to record our thanks to all of them  
for their outstanding contribution over 
the past year.

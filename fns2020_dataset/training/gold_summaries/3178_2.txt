FOCUS DELIVERY GROWTH
Kounrad Operation
The Group acquired a 60% interest in the 
Kounrad project in September 2007 following 
a tender of the subsoil use rights to develop 
the project with the local Kazakhstan 
authorities. The project is an in-situ dump 
leach with a 10,000 tonne per annum copper 
SX-EW plant. Whilst the project has historically 
been structured as a 60:40 joint venture, 
throughout the development and construction 
phase, it was 100% managed and financed  
by CAML. The Company has been working 
towards 100% ownership of the project 
following the acquisition of the 40% interest  
in KCC on 21 October 2013. This is planned  
for completion in H1 2014. In the 20 months  
to 31 December 2013 the SX-EW plant has 
produced 17,095 tonnes of copper cathode.
Kounrad Resource
The resources at Kounrad have been classified as 
JORC compliant during 2013 following significant 
drilling and sampling works on the dumps 
between 2007 and 2012. It is estimated that the 
dumps contain over 650 million tonnes of ore 
containing copper in excess of 600,000 tonnes. 
The leaching process to extract the copper will 
recover between 35 % and 52% of the contained 
copper depending on the mineralogy of the ore. 
In parallel to the JORC classification the resources 
were also placed onto the approved ‘State 
Balance’ of geological resources during 2013. 
The combination of the eastern and western 
dumps cover a combined area of 22 square 
kilometres and since the commencement of 
leaching in 2012 a total of 1,410km of pipework 
has been installed.
Investment in Chile
The Company acquired a 50% interest in a 
copper tailings project in Chañaral Bay, Chile, 
in late November 2013. This was the Group’s 
first acquisition outside of the Central Asia 
region. From 1938 to 1975, an estimated 250 
million tonnes of tailings from inland copper 
mines were discharged into the Rio Salado 
which outflows into Chañaral Bay. The area is 
heavily polluted as a result and there is 
significant local and national support for the 
project. Studies to-date estimate that there is a 
non-JORC compliant resource in the beach and 
bay area of 116Mt at 0.25% copper equating 
to approximately 290,000 tonnes of copper. 
Conventional metallurgical processing 
methods are proposed to be used and the 
metallurgical studies conducted so far suggest 
that up to 80% of the contained copper may 
be recoverable.
Kounrad Expansion
The Company is well advanced in planning for 
an increase in production capacity at the 
Kounrad site. In late 2013, the CAML Board 
approved a capital expenditure programme of 
$2.6 million for the addition of two new boilers. 
It is anticipated the boilers will be commissioned 
in late October 2014 and the production target 
for 2014 has been increased to 11,000 tonnes. 
Additional plans for expansion will be finalised 
once the Kounrad Transaction is completed and 
the Group owns 100% of the project.

Overall trading in line with expectations for the year, 
excluding the £14m operating profit impact of unprecedented 
weather conditions on First Student and Greyhound in the 
fourth quarter
Group revenue increased by 1.2% on a like-for-like basis after 
adjusting for the UK Bus portfolio changes, disposal of FSS 
and the non-recurring London 2012 Games revenues
1
Adjusted operating profit increased by 5.5%, reflecting 
improved underlying operating performances in four divisions, 
partially offset by slower progress in First Student and the 
extreme weather
Adjusted EPS fell 31.8% due to the dilutive effect of the rights 
issue completed in June 2013
Balance sheet strengthened, net debt: EBITDA ratio reduced 
to 2.2 times from 3.4 times last year and a new £800m five 
year revolving credit facility signed 
ROCE
2
 increased to 8.2% (2013: 7 .0%). Medium term target  
is 10-12%
Dividend – taking together the current stage of the turnaround 
programmes and our commitment to our capital programme, 
the Board has decided to refrain from reinstating a dividend  
at this point
Board changes – including the appointment of three new 
Non-Executive Directors with effect from 24 June 2014
First Student – performance affected by historically severe 
weather; accelerated programmes to address contract 
portfolio pricing and deliver further cost savings 
First Transit – record of good growth and margin 
performance maintained
Greyhound – underlying improvement in demand trends and 
continuation of profitable expansion of Greyhound Express, 
partially offset by weather disruption to the network
UK Bus – step-by-step transformation plan progressing and 
delivering sustainable improvements in key metrics
UK Rail – delivering solid revenue growth underpinned  
by continued passenger volume increases and strong  
operational delivery

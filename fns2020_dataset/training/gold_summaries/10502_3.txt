 8 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
Chairman’s Statement 
Our third year as a public company 
was one of great change. The 
impact of the credit crunch on our 
business, especially our Money 
vertical, was significant. Across the 
whole of the United Kingdom, there 
was a collapse in mortgage and 
secured lending as the banks 
contracted their loan books. 
Against this economic backdrop, the 
Group’s revenue declined by 23% 
from £178.8m to £136.9m for the 
year ending 31 December 2009 and 
adjusted EBITDA declined by 26% to 
£36.0m for the year. 
However, some positives for the 
Group emerged from the crisis. It 
accelerated our transition to a 
professional management team; it 
prompted a significant reduction in 
the cost base; it precipitated a 
review and rethink of everything 
that we do; and it demonstrated the 
resilience of our diversified business 
model with yet another year of solid 
cash flow. 
Peter Plumb was appointed Chief 
Executive Officer in February 2009. 
Graham Donoghue and David 
Osborne were appointed as 
Directors at the same time. All are 
experienced professional managers.
The new management team have 
settled in well. The drop in profitability 
was minimised, the business was 
stabilised, improvements were made 
and by the final quarter our year on 
year profitability was ahead of the 
previous year. We came through the 
worst recession since the 1930’s solidly 
profitable, leaner and better managed.
Each of our verticals were 
significantly enhanced during the 
year and our advertising programme 
changed, initially with Peter Jones 
and then the new programme which 
commenced in January this year 
with Omid Djalili. We retained our 
leading market position in the 
Money vertical, maintaining market 
share, in spite of revenues, 
particularly from mortgage and 
secured lending, falling by 44%. 
We lost some market share in the 
first quarter in our Insurance 
vertical, when some of our site 
enhancements failed to generate 
the improvements expected, but 
held share in the rest of the year. 
Our travel website suffered in line 
with the rest of the market and 
consequently was managed for 
margin. Our Home Services vertical 
performed satisfactorily given the 
greater stability in gas and 
electricity prices in 2009. We 
believe there is good potential to 
switch customers from these to our 
other verticals.
Following a review of the Group’s 
cash requirements in July 2009, the 
Company paid an interim dividend 
of 1.3p per ordinary share on 16 
October 2009, consistent with the 
interim dividend in 2008. In addition, 
the Company paid a special 
dividend on the same date of 4.93p 
per ordinary share reflecting the 
Board’s confidence in the ability of 
the business to generate cash on an 
ongoing basis.
During the year, the business 
continued to generate cash, and we 
ended the year with cash balances of 
£53.8m. With the business stabilised, 
and with the tax changes announced 
in the April 2009 Budget, we have 
decided to recommend another 
special dividend of £25m or 4.91p 
per ordinary share. This brings the 
total dividend for the year to 13.34p 
per ordinary share including the total 
of the special dividends of 9.84p per 
ordinary share. If approved by 
shareholders at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting, this will be 
paid on 1 April 2010 to all 
shareholders on the register as at  
5 March 2010. 
We are a very cash generative 
business, but will run with a 
conservative debt free balance 
sheet to enable us to take advantage 
of the opportunities as our business 
and the economy recovers.
The new year has begun 
satisfactorily and we are quietly 
confident that the worst is behind 
us. It has been a difficult time for the 
Company. Our employees have 
responded magnificently to the 
challenges they have faced and, on 
behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank them for their commitment 
during the year. 
The Annual General Meeting will be 
held at 10.30am on Wednesday 31 
March 2010 at De Vere Carden Park 
Hotel, near Chester, Cheshire, CH3 
9DQ and I look forward to seeing 
you there.

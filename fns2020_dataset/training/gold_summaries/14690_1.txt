 WINNING MOMENTS 18 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007-2008 19
In July 2008, Sportingbet brought 
in-house the operation and 
management of miapuesta.com, 
the Group’s Spanish domain. 
The contract termination payment 
and the cost of setting up the  
in-house operation, has resulted 
in an exceptional charge of £4.7m 
during the period. This move 
provides the Group with operational 
and strategic control over its  
largest market. 
Finally, in October 2008 the Group 
signed a significant extension to  
the contracts with its Greek 
marketing partner.
This partnership has to 
date established Greece as 
Sportingbet’s second largest 
market. This new agreement 
provides the partner with the ability 
to market the Sportingbet brand, 
and its own secondary brand 
vistabet.com, across Greece as well 
as the new markets of Romania, 
Croatia, Slovenia and certain other 
Balkan regions. In light of the highly 
successful historic performance of 
the Greek domains, this extension 
commits a key supplier for the 
medium term whilst increasing the 
geographical footprint of the Group.
The restructuring of these 
marketing arrangements has 
an impact on the structure of 
the Group’s Income Statement.  
Commissions paid to the partners 
are classified as a marketing 
expense. Once these businesses 
are brought in-house, this 
commission will cease to be paid; 
however these savings will be 
largely offset by the Group’s own 
marketing in these regions, an 
increase in the level of reported 
bonuses and additional staff costs.
During the year the European 
region generated poker rake of 
£23.7m (2007: £29.0m), pre bonus 
deductions, down 18.3% year on 
year. Poker now accounts for just 
15% of the Group’s NGR, down 
from 23% in the prior year. Poker 
remains difficult as the environment 
has become increasingly 
competitive with large US-focused 
poker companies using significant 
cash flow and their high liquidity to 
capture the European market. 
MARKETING PARTNER REVIEW
Over the last two years, the Board 
has reviewed its arrangements with 
its European marketing partners.  
These marketing partnerships 
were established a number of 
years ago and provide a variety of 
locally focused support including 
marketing, customer services and 
in some circumstances, payment 
processing, in return for a share 
of the gaming revenue generated 
from those regions. Whilst all of 
these contracts are similar in their 
operation, they each have different 
contractual obligations for both 
Sportingbet and the marketing 
partner. These relationships 
flourished during the early part of 
their tenure providing Sportingbet 
with strong market positions in 
Spain, Turkey, Greece and Bulgaria.  
As these markets have matured 
the benefits from some of the 
arrangements have diminished and 
the Group concluded that some 
should be brought in-house whilst 
others expanded. 
Last year, the Group purchased the 
business and assets of its Turkish 
marketing partner, as well as 
terminating the contract with  
its much smaller Scandinavia  
based partner.
This year, the Board has continued 
this strategic initiative, resulting 
in the purchase of its Bulgarian 
marketing partner in March 2008.
In addition, the contract with its 
Hungarian marketing partner 
was not renewed, resulting in the 
operation of this domain being 
brought in-house in April 2008. WINNING MOMENTS 20 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007-2008 21
BOARD OF 
DIRECTORS
The final element of the Group’s 
restructuring was a review of its 
head office function. Peter Dicks 
returned to the Board as Chairman 
and Non-Executive Director, having 
previously held the position from 
January 2000 to September 2006.  
In addition, Jim Wilkinson joined the 
Board as Group Finance Director 
having previously held the same 
position at Johnson Service Group 
plc and Informa Group Plc. As part 
of this review it was concluded 
that the role of Chief Operating 
Officer was no longer required and 
as a result Dave Hobday, Chief 
Operating Officer, left the Group in 
May 2008.
TRADING OUTLOOK
The Group will continue to 
concentrate on developing its 
sports offering and the imminent 
introduction of live streaming of 
sport to the Group’s customer base 
aims to drive further in-running 
betting volumes. We will continue 
to increase the breadth of markets 
offered, in line with the demands 
of our geographically diverse 
customer base whilst cross  
selling additional revenue streams 
to our customers. Our strong 
balance sheet stands us in good 
stead during these times of 
financial uncertainty. 
Whilst there is no evidence of 
having been impacted by the recent 
turmoil in the financial sector, the 
Group will continue to monitor 
customer performance statistics 
closely. However, the new financial 
year has started well with NGR 
growth in excess of 30% in the first 
two months. As such the Board 
remains cautiously optimistic of  
the outcome for the current 
financial year.
AUSTRALIA
Sportingbet Australia had an 
excellent year with NGR up 55% 
making the business the fourth 
largest territory in the Group, 
accounting for 13% of total 
NGR. The growth was driven by 
a 34% increase in the number 
of customers from 23,094 to 
31,032. The increase in NGR was 
particularly pleasing as there was 
an unprecedented outbreak of 
equine influenza in August 2007 
which curtailed horse racing, the 
Group’s main product in Australia, 
in both Queensland and New South 
Wales, for much of the first half of 
the year.  Despite the interruption, 
the business grew by significant 
volumes to stand clearly as 
Australia’s number one 
independent bookmaker.  
The NGR percentage for the region, 
after betting taxes and product 
fees, was 3.7% (2007: 2.9%), 
amounting to gross gaming revenue 
of £23.5m (2007: £15.8m).
The relatively low margin compared 
to the rest of the Group is due 
to a combination of the betting 
market in general in Australia and 
the large proportion of the Group’s 
business which derives from the 
telephone rather than the internet. 
Typically, internet customers are 
more frequent bettors and generate 
a higher margin, but have a much 
lower average stake size.  
Sportingbet’s Australian business 
operates under a Northern 
Territories licence, which only 
permits sports betting.
Recent developments in the 
States of Victoria and New South 
Wales have removed restrictions 
preventing bookmakers licensed 
out-of-state from advertising within 
these States. As Australia’s largest 
independent bookmaker these 
developments are welcomed and 
will further assist the promotion of 
the business.
The Australian betting industry has 
recently been subject to additional 
charges introduced by State based 
horse racing boards, in particular, 
in 2006 Racing Victoria Limited 
introduced a product charge for 
the approval to publish race cards 
or races held within the State of 
Victoria. A similar turnover based 
fee was introduced by the State of 
New South Wales on 1 September 
2008. Whilst an additional cost  
to the business, these fees have 
been fully factored into the Group’s  
profit expectations. WINNING MOMENTS 22 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007-2008 23

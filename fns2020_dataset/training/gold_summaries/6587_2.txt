Our company
Our technology and engineering are at the heart of vehicles
and aircraft from the world’s leading automotive, offhighway
and aerospace manufacturers.
There are almost 40,000 GKN people in more than 30 
countries and every day we harness our global technology
and manufacturing resources to supply the highest quality
components, systems, structures and services.
When we fulﬁl the trust our customers place in us we can
enrich our shareholders and support the communities of
which we are a part. And because we care for the environment
and the dignity and human rights of others we are all building
a business which can be sustained by future generations.
Every stakeholder in a great company should expect nothing
less. But those with a stake in GKN should expect more.
Expect more from the people of GKN.

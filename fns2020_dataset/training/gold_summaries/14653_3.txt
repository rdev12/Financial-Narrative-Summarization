Chairman
Spirent made significant strategic progress 
in 2012 through organic investment to bring 
new solutions to market, the acquisition 
of new technologies for testing the security 
of application‑aware networks and the 
subscriber experience of mobile devices 
on live networks, in order to expand the 
markets it serves, and by the divestment of 
its last non‑core business. A restructuring 
of the Service Assurance division has 
returned the business to more satisfactory 
levels of profitability. These achievements 
were made against a background of 
economic uncertainty in all regions, 
which in turn tempered growth.
Revenue for the continuing Group was 
similar to last year at $472.4 million (2011 
$470.5 million) and reported profit before 
tax decreased by 3 per cent to $110.7 
million (2011 $114.3 million). The strong 
start to the year was followed by a weak 
demand environment materialising during 
the second quarter, which then persisted 
throughout the remainder of the year. 
Operational highlights included the growth 
in new solutions for 4G/LTE wireless   3
overview business review governance financial statements $52.2 million. Both businesses have 
been fully integrated into the Performance 
Analysis division. The divestment of the 
Systems division in November for a cash 
consideration of $63.2 million has enabled 
the Company to focus on the development 
of its core business. Of the proceeds, 
$27 .2 million was applied to the repurchase 
of Spirent shares in the market for 
cancellation. The Company has no debt 
and cash balances were $248.6 million 
at 31 December 2012.
The Board continues to focus on a high 
return on capital employed in the business. 
The operating return on capital employed 
(excluding cash balances) in the continuing 
Group in 2012 was 52 per cent. The target 
set for return on investment in acquired 
businesses is in line with or in excess of 
the cost of capital. Returns remain low 
to negligible on cash balances, which 
are retained to allow surety of completion 
for acquisition negotiations. While the 
Company expects to continue to invest 
in acquisitions which are in line with the 
strategy, it is also committed to making 
returns through share buybacks. To that 
end, during 2012 13.4 million shares were 
repurchased utilising cash of $30.8 million. 
The intention is to continue the on market 
repurchase programme during 2013, 
envisaged at the time of the divestment 
of Systems, and to offset the dilutive 
effect of share‑based incentives.
The final dividend recommended is 1.83 
cents per share compared with 1.67 cents 
per share in 2011. This brings the total 
dividend for 2012 to 3.22 cents per share 
compared with 2.93 cents for 2011. The 
increase in total dividend per share is 10 
per cent and reflects the strong operating 
margin and cash generation of the Group. 
In sterling terms this represents 2.10 pence 
per share, an increase in the distribution 
to our shareholders of 15 per cent.
development testing, the enhancements 
to new high speed Ethernet test solutions 
and the renewal of large long term service 
assurance maintenance contracts. 
The one significant area of weakness, 
other than Service Assurance, was the 
global navigation satellite system 
emulation products in the positioning 
business which experienced a 26 per cent 
decrease in revenue due to caution in 
government spending and delays to the 
commercial rollout of the specifications 
to a Chinese satellite navigation system. 
This decrease had a 3 percentage points 
negative impact on revenue growth for the 
Performance Analysis division for the year.
Return on sales, based on adjusted 
operating profit, was maintained at 
25 per cent for the continuing Group, 
which is amongst the best in the test 
and measurement industry. This was 
after expanding product development 
expenditure by $2.8 million and sales 
and distribution by $1.2 million. 
Adjusted basic earnings per share grew 
by 4 per cent to 13.38 cents (2011 12.92 
cents); this is before charging exceptional 
items, acquisition related costs, acquired 
intangible asset amortisation and 
share‑based payment. Basic earnings per 
share for the continuing Group decreased 
in 2012 by 5 per cent to 12.46 cents per 
share (2011 13.17 cents).
The Group’s free cash flow generation from 
continuing businesses increased to $84.0 
million (2011 $69.3 million) representing a 
strong increase year‑on‑year; this is a cash 
conversion ratio of 105 per cent of reported 
earnings before non‑cash prior year tax 
(2011 84 per cent). Spirent used its cash 
resources to fund the acquisitions of Mu 
Dynamics, Inc. in April for $39.8 million and 
Metrico Wireless, Inc. in September for

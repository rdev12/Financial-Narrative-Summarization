2015 was $17.56/bbl (based on an oil sales price of $40/bbl),  
a gross margin of 44%.
Our competitive advantage 
First to move
JKX invested in Ukraine over 20 years ago to help meet the 
demand gap and was rewarded with licences covering some 
of the best oil and gas fields in Ukraine. JKX has significant 
experience of doing business in this region.
Sustainable low cost production, cash generative operations
The Company commenced commercial production of oil and 
gas in Ukraine in 1995. It has over 450 experienced local staff 
working there and six producing oil and gas fields.
Our six producing fields and two Gas Processing Facilities 
(‘GPFs’) are located in the Poltava region of Ukraine.

Our Novo-Nikolaevskoye Complex reserves comprise five 
distinct fields producing in to one GPF. In addition we have a 
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (‘LPG’) facility which converts some 
of our gas into LPG for sale into the expanding Ukrainian 
market.
Elizavetovskoye field   
5
Our Elizavetovskoye field and GPF, which are 45km from our 
Novo-Nikolaevskoye Complex, began commercial production 
in 2014. The field currently produces from three wells.
Our investment
We have invested over $550m in Ukrainian oil and gas 
development projects over the past 22 years. We have 
produced and sold gas, oil and condensate locally for the past 
21 years.
Ukrainian reserves

At the end of 2015, our 2P reserves in Ukraine comprised  
158.4 Bcf of gas and 3.3 MMbbl of oil (total 29.7 MMboe).

Market overview – Ukraine
Why are we here?
A huge demand for energy   
1
There is a huge demand for energy in Ukraine and a lack of 
local supply. Historically there has been a lack of investment 
in the development of oil and gas reserves in Ukraine and as 
a result there are good opportunities to develop additional 
reserves in Ukraine by applying the latest exploration and 
production technology. 
Ukraine is the fourth largest consumer in Europe with annual 
gas consumption of 42 Bcm/year. Domestic production is 
steady at 20 Bcm/year. As such, a significant gas demand gap 
will remain in Ukraine for the foreseeable future.
Gas pricing and realisations   
2
Ukraine imports its gas from Russia and Europe. The pricing 
of Russian gas has always been based on an oil-based 
formula. The pricing of gas from Europe is based on gas-
to-gas price competition at European hubs. The dynamic of 
these two pricing philosophies differ significantly and there 
are times when the hub based prices are significantly cheaper 
than the formulaic prices.
This is the arbitrage opportunity for Ukraine and 15 Bcm/year 
of gas can be accessed this way if the commercial incentives 
prevail.
The fundamental base gas price of the Ukraine market 
however will always be at least the oil indexed price or the hub 
price of Slovakia plus the additional cost of reverse flow. As a 
local producer we should always be able to get better netback 
prices than any supplier who has to cover all of these shipping 
costs (circa $20/Mcm).
A default price of European Hub plus $20/Mcm is a good floor 
price for JKX.
Netback analysis   
3
On 2 August 2014, the Ukrainian government increased gas 
production taxes to 55% (from 28%) and oil production taxes 
to 45% (from 39%) initially for 3 months but subsequently 
extended this through to 31 December 2015. From 1 January 
2016 the gas production tax has reduced to 29%.
The netback on our gas sold in Ukraine in 2015 was 
approximately $4.77/Mcf (based on a gas sales price of  
194,000 bpd

Gas market changes in 2015
The balance of gas (20 Bcm/year) is imported and until 2015, 
virtually all of these imports have either been from Russia or from 
other ex-Soviet countries (particularly Turkmenistan) through 
Europe.
In 2015, the market has changed significantly due to the initiation 
of so called “reverse flow” capability from Europe. This entails  
the movement of gas from west to east across the existing border 
crossings between Ukraine and Hungary, Poland and most 
importantly Slovakia.
The last of these (Velke-Kapucharny) has been the major transit 
point for westward-moving Russian gas to Europe for over 40 years.
Redundant capacity in the complex of pipelines and compressors 
at this transit hub have been refurbished and upgraded to allow  
for the movement of gas in the opposite direction to the 
predominant flow.
This new-found technical capacity allows Ukraine to purchase gas 
from Europe and, rather than being completely dependent on 
Russia for imports, Ukraine can now assess competing bids for 
gas imports from Gazprom on the one side and European Energy 
Utilities on the other.
The macro gas world of Ukraine has changed forever.
This change broadens the supply pool in terms of the number of 
companies competing in the market which should in time result in 
more competition. Financial statements

Why are we here?
A huge demand for gas   
1
 
Industrial output in Russia declined through 2015 and there 
has been a proportionate reduction in domestic gas demand. 
However, the south of Russia is defying the general trend and 
in the Krasnodar region, where our Koshekhablskoye gas field 
is located, there has been a sustained increase in industrial 
gas demand in recent years. 
Annual industrial consumption of gas in the Krasnodar and 
Adygea regions is more than four times gas production.
Part of the reason for this is the population growth (and 
hence energy demands) of Sochi – initially as an Olympic 
venue, but more latterly as an expanding city and a favoured 
tourist destination. Gas is used locally in cement production, 
steel construction, glass manufacturing, heating and air 
conditioning – all of which is now abundant in Sochi.
Lack of local supply   
1
In southern Russia, gas demands are partially met by 
transporting gas long distances (at high cost) from production 
centres in the north of Russia. 
In Russia, historical Gazprom gas fields are now all in decline. 
To replace lost production, most investment into gas fields 
is in the development of the Yamal peninsula gas fields 
which are more than 4,000km north of our gas reserves at 
Koshekhablskoye, Adygea in southern Russia.
Forecast gas demand   
2
Due to a rapid industrialisation in southern Russia in the past  
five years, by 2020 gas demands there are expected to double.
Our competitive advantage   
3
First to move 
In 2007, we purchased the licence to rehabilitate and develop 
the Koshekhablskoye gas field in order to participate 
in the rapidly growing independent gas market. The 
Koshekhablskoye gas field is located in the Republic of 
Adygea, southern Russia, where gas resource is scarce, and 
there are high transportation costs from Russia’s main gas 
production area in the far north, some 4,000km away.
Gas realisations   
4
The average increase in Russian gas prices since 2007 has 
been 18%. There was an official 7% increase in the regulated 
maximum industrial gas price in 2015.
Netback analysis   
5
The gas production tax rate in southern Russia is 9%, which 
is approximately one third of the rate in Ukraine (29%). The 
netback on our gas sold in Russia in 2015 was approximately 
$0.70/Mcf (based on a gas sales price of $1.68/Mcf) – a gross 
margin of 41%.

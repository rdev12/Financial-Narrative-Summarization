 “ THIS HAS BEEN A LANDMARK 
YEAR FOR OUR COMPANY .  
TWO YEARS AGO WE 
EMBARKED ON A TRANSITION 
PLAN. I AM VERY PLEASED  
TO REPORT THA T THE FIRST 
ST AGE OF THA T TRANSITION  
IS NOW COMPLETE.”
This has been a landmark year for our 
Company. Two years ago we embarked  
on a transition plan. I am very pleased  
to report that the first stage of that 
transition is now complete. Last year  
81% of our revenue was derived from  
two clients on whose behalf we developed 
games. This financial year 84% of our 
sales (including associated merchandise) 
have come from the consumers who 
bought our self-published game Elite 
Dangerous. In 2016 we expect 100%  
of our revenue to be booked from 
consumers buying our self-published 
games. This transition has involved 
significant internal re-organisation  
as well as adapting from a B2B to B2C 
model. I take this opportunity to thank  
all our employees for their dedication, 
long hours and hard work. In 2015 we 
also released the last of our games 
developed for third parties: Tales from 
Deep Space on behalf of Amazon and 
Screamride for Microsoft. We thank these 
customers and continue to maintain  
a close relationship with them as they 
play key parts in the distribution of our 
self-published games.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
2015 above all else has been the year of 
Elite Dangerous. We have built a virtual 
galaxy with 400 billion star systems in 
which players can engage with each other 
in combat, explore the stars and their 
planets, mine resources and trade them. 
The second step in our transition is  
to take the success of Elite Dangerous  
to become a multi-franchise game 
publisher. We recently announced that 
our second franchise, Planet Coaster,  
is being built on our knowledge and  
long experience of roller coaster games.  
We expect to reveal details of a third 
franchise once Planet Coaster is released. 
This will keep our creative teams busy  
for many years ahead.

STRATEGIC REPORT
02  FRONTIER DEVELOPMENTS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2015 The Group successfully completed  
its outstanding work-for-hire 
commitments during the year, 
developing Screamride on Xbox  
One for Microsoft Game Studios  
and Tales from Deep Space on  
behalf of Amazon.
WORK-FOR-HIRE BUSINESS 
SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED
As well as developing franchises, the  
core of our capability must focus on 
remaining at the forefront of game 
development technology. Our COBRA 
engine, which enables us to release 
games on many platforms, remains  
an important effort. Elite Dangerous  
was one of the first games to showcase  
the possibilities of Virtual Reality (VR)  
and we intend to stay in touch with 
hardware manufacturers of VR systems 
such as Facebook’s Oculus Rift, Valve  
and HTC’s Vive, Microsoft’s HoloLens  
and Sony’s Morpheus as 3D virtual  
reality becomes more commonplace. 
Elite Dangerous has now been released  
on PC, Mac and Xbox One, and we will 
continue to invest in releases to achieve 
the maximum customer reach. 
In last year’s statement I said that  
“In future years, starting with 2015, we  
will see the harvest of the seeds we have 
sown.” We have delivered a transformation 
in our business model, achieved a record  
level of revenue, sold our first developed 
game to 825,000 consumers (the majority 
through our own web store), re-engineered 
our development capability (from third 
party published to self-published) and 
announced a net profit in the financial  
year. Looking ahead I see a multi-franchise 
game developer / publisher with its games 
being distributed on the most modern  
and best hardware platforms, achieving 
sustainable returns for our shareholders. 
Activision Blizzard Inc. and Electronic  
Arts Inc. are good exemplars as to where  
we are heading.
Our Company could not achieve its 
success without the hard work, creative 
talent, dedication and perspiration from 
our exceptional employees. I take this 
opportunity to thank them on behalf of  
all shareholders. Equally, our transition 
would not have been possible without the 
financial support of our shareholders and 
backers. I take this opportunity to thank 
them on behalf of all employees.

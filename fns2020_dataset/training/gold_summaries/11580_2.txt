CHAIRMAN’S 
STATEMENT
CONTINUED
As a result of the reduced revenue, profit before tax and exceptional 
items was $9.2m (FY12: $26.3m) with basic earnings per share before 
tax and exceptional items reducing to 12.8c (FY12: 36.8c).
Cash flow before acquisition and financing activities improved 
significantly in the year, generating $10.5m compared to a $3.1m outflow 
last year due to revenue mix, a higher proportion of capital sales and the 
timing of finance lease receipts. As a result, we were able to reduce net 
debt to $39.4m from $47.9m at the end of the previous financial year. 
During the year, we increased our revolving credit facility to $50m 
providing additional flexibility to fund the business.
I look forward with confidence to next year with Daytona remaining a key 
driver of revenue growth underpinned by strong clinical data that will help 
to increase penetration in the ophthalmology segment. We also expect 
to see a continued reduction in the cost of the Daytona device.
Finally, I would like to thank Louisa Burdett for her contributions 
as Chief Financial Officer and to welcome Robert Kennedy to the 
Board as her successor. I would also like to thank Barry Rose for his 
valuable contribution to the Board over the last eight years both as 
Audit Committee Chairman and Senior Independent Director. As always, 
I would also like to thank our investors for their continued support during 
the past year, and our employees for their outstanding efforts which 
have underpinned the advances achieved within the business.

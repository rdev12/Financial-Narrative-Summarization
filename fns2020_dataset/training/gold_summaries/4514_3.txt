I am pleased to report that De Vere Group
once again made good progress during
the year in a very difficult trading market.
Central to this progress was continued
sales growth despite these testing
conditions, especially in the hotel market,
and Greens moving into profit as
expected. Both our hotel brands continue
to outperform the market with De Vere
Hotels once again increasing its RevPAR
premium. 
One of the key highlights of the year was
the successful staging of the 34th Ryder
Cup Matches at The De Vere Belfry in
September. This event showcased the 
De Vere brand to a global audience and
can only have increased brand awareness
as a result. The expansion of the Group
continues on schedule with the opening
during the year of the 14th Village Hotel
and Leisure Club and four new Greens
Health & Fitness clubs. I am also delighted
to report that the refurbishment of the 
De Vere Cavendish St. James’s has been
completed. 
Group turnover for the year ended 
29 September 2002 was £293.9 million,
an increase of 7.3% (2001: £273.8
million), whilst EBITDA before exceptional
items rose by 7.2% from £70.0 million to
£75.0 million. Operating profit from
continuing operations on a pre-
exceptional basis was up 4.2% to 
£51.9 million from £49.8 million. Profit
before tax was £38.5 million compared
with a loss last year of £18.1 million.
Earnings per share, excluding exceptional
items, were 23.55 pence (2001: 21.22
pence restated).
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final
dividend of 7.35 pence per ordinary
share, which, when taken together with
the interim dividend of 3.95 pence,
represents a total dividend of 11.30 pence,
an increase of 6.6%. This is payable on 
21 February 2003 to shareholders on the
register on 24 January 2003. 
Board
David Reid retired from the Board in 
April 2002 and, on behalf of the Group, 
I would like to thank him for his long 
and valued contribution. In the following
month we were delighted to welcome
Debbie Howard as a Non-executive
Director, who brings an added dimension
to the Board through her experience as
Group Human Resources Director of 
RAC plc.
People
On behalf of the Board, I would like to
thank all the Group’s employees for their
commitment, support and enthusiasm in
playing their part to help the Group
achieve its goals of delivering excellent
service to our customers and, in so doing,
creating value for our shareholders.

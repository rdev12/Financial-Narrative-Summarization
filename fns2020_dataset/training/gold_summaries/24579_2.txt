20% increase in revenue:
Revenue increased by 20% to £159.0 million, being driven by an increase of £24.7 million from the Vantage
division. Vantage revenue has beneﬁted from improved revenue margins on funds, increased assets under
administration and a full year’s revenue on assets secured in the previous year, all of which have more than
oﬀset the fall in revenue margin on cash.  The proportion of recurring revenue i.e. management fees, renewal
commission and interest, remained high at 72% (2009: 70%).  
(*) Adjusted proﬁt excludes one-oﬀ costs relating to the new oﬃce, as detailed in the Financial Review. 
Adjusted operating proﬁt margin of 56.5%: 
Costs have been well controlled during the year.  The Group’s adjusted operating margin has increased by
2.9% to 56.5%.  The increase resulted from 20% revenue growth coupled with an increase to operating costs
of 12%.
£17.5 billion total assets under administration:
The 47% growth in asset values is attributable to strong new business volumes combined with a signiﬁcant
market increase. There was a 17% increase in the FTSE All-Share index during the year.
23% increase in adjusted diluted EPS: 
from 11.3 pence to 13.9 pence
18% increase to total dividend payout: 
from 10.101 pence to 11.88 pence

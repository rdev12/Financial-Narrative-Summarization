www.carpetright.plc.uk | 13 Q.  How do you rate the 
Group’s trading performance 
in the financial year?  
A.  On target.  We are pleased with our 
progress in turning the business around.  
During the year we have successfully 
trialled a number of initiatives and are  
now in a place where we are able to roll 
them out across the estate.  However,  
we recognise we are in a market where 
the competition has intensified and the 
consumer environment is uncertain.
Q.  What were the most 
important achievements  
of the year?  
A.  Hitting the numbers.  I am pleased  
with the progress of the concept stores, 
our growth in hard flooring, which is 
strategically important, as well as  
initiatives such as Interest Free Credit. 
Q.  What progress was  
made with the plans to 
revitalise the brand?  
A.  We are launching the new brand  
look effective from 1 July 2016.  This  
has been extensively researched and we 
have trialled a number of options across 
the country this year.  We believe it delivers 
a more contemporary look and is now 
suitable for roll out.
Q.  Are you moving fast 
enough to keep pace with  
the competition?  
A.  As fast as we can, given all our other 
strategic imperatives and the “day job”.  
Our objective is to tackle competition with 
a number of initiatives, including ensuring 
we have the best team to deal with it, 
refurbishment/refreshment of the physical 
environment and a competitive offer.
Q.  How did customers 
respond to the changes  
made in the trial of the  
new store format?  
A.  Positively – some areas have worked 
especially well, particularly sales of hard 
flooring and premium branded products.  
Customer research has been hugely 
positive on the uncluttered, more 
contemporary, store environment.
Q.  What changes will you  
be adopting as you move  
to refurbish the UK estate?
A.  We intend to prioritise the refit to  
our highest turnover stores, our smaller 
high street stores and areas where we  
are most obviously at a competitive 
disadvantage.  Within twelve months  
we expect around 100 stores to be  
trading under the updated brand. 
Q.  What gives you the 
confidence that you are  
on the right track with  
these plans? 
A.  Sales numbers and customer research 
feedback, as well as what our store staff 
are saying.
Q.  How long will it take for 
the changes you are planning 
to be rolled out across the  
UK estate?
A.  This is a long-term repositioning and 
revitalising of the brand, and the estate  
– it is not an affordable overnight 
transformation.  We are doing this from a 
position of market leadership and believe 
that our actions are sustainable as we 
tackle our legacy property issues and 
educate the consumer on the revitalised 
Carpetright brand.

chief executive’s Q&A continued
Q.  How have hard flooring 
sales progressed over  
the year?  
A.  Progress has been excellent – this has 
been led by fitted laminate up 21.4% and 
luxury vinyl tiles up 18.9%.  While carpet 
retains mass popularity, there is a lifestyle 
shift of spend to this category and our 
early tests on engineered wood have  
also been encouraging.
Q.  How have you  
changed your approach  
to promotions?  
A.  Gone are the days of 70% off 
“Madness” sales.  Our limit is 50% and  
we are more focused on total package 
value for the customer, including the 
product, underlay, accessories and fitting.  
Promotions will always be important for 
big ticket retailers but price compliance, 
integrity and managing promotions 
responsibly is also important in building  
our trust and reputation.
14 | Annual Report and Accounts 2016 Q.  What progress did you 
make with reducing store 
occupancy costs during  
the year?  
A.  Excellent – we closed 43 stores under 
pre agreed pay back criteria.  We still  
have a legacy of too many over-rented 
stores but we have made significant 
progress.  We will be gradually running  
the Storeys brand down during the next 
twelve months – turning these stores into 
Carpetright or “Carpetright Clearance” 
units.  We are opening a number of smaller 
high street stores and the early results  
look very promising.
Q.  Raising service standards 
is a key element of your plans 
– how is that initiative going?
A.  Positive.  Our Trust Pilot score in July 
2014 was 1.7 out of 10.  It’ s now up to 8.7 , 
which is excellent progress but still leaves 
room for further improvement.  Our ‘Do 
We Measure Up’ programme goes from 
strength to strength in understanding and 
acting on customer feedback.  We want  
to raise our Net Promoter Score from the 
current level of 71% and that is a major 
strategic priority.
Q.  How did the competitive 
environment change in  
the year?  
A.  Competition intensified across the  
year, largely as the result of a new market 
entrant which went head to head with our 
established stores on a number of retail 
parks.  We also saw more aggressive 
pricing from other competitors on a local 
basis but this has always been a periodic 
feature of the market – we just have to 
respond on a local level and it’ s very granular .
Q.  Will we see some of the 
changes being made in the 
UK being adopted in your 
Rest of Europe business?  
A.  It’s a very different business in Belgium 
and the Netherlands but the principles  
are still the same.  We are opening some 
new concept stores suited to their local 
market and the results have been very 
encouraging indeed.
Q.  Where do you see the 
biggest opportunity in the 
year ahead?  
A.  The rebranding is an exciting multi-year 
project.  In the short term, the biggest 
sales opportunities are in Hard Flooring 
and Beds.  Resizing the property portfolio 
and delivering more efficient service under 
our ‘Making It Easy’ project, will deliver 
like-for-like growth and the all-important 
customer recommendations.
Q.  What should we expect  
of Carpetright over the next  
twelve months?  
A.  Significant progress against all  
the strategic areas driven by ‘Putting 
customers at the heart of everything  
we do’.  We anticipate a further improved 
performance if the external environment 
and economy stay reasonably solid.
Q.  What are the key risks  
to your growth plans?  
A.  The general economy and  
customer confidence.
Q.  Where do you see  
Carpetright in five years?  
A.  A vibrant revitalised business with  
a much more rational property portfolio 
and a lower fixed cost base.  A refreshed 
brand and workforce delivering consistently 
excellent customer service.

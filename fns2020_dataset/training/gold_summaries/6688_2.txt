GROUP HIGHLIGHTS
Go-Ahead is one of the UK’s leading providers of bus and rail services.Our strategy is to deliver high
quality services in dense urban markets.
GO-AHEAD – A GOOD PLACETO BE...
Focused on bus and rail
We have made good strategic progress over the financial year.
We retained our Southern franchise and launched the UK’s first
domestic high speed rail service in Southeastern; disposed of the
majority of our loss making aviation services division; invested over
£35 million in UK bus acquisitions and started a yellow school bus
joint venture in North America.
Fundamental sector strengths
Public transport plays a key role in building a strong economy,reducing
traffic congestion and air pollution and helps to promote social inclusion.
There is strong political support for public transport and a clear recognition
that the private sector is best placed to deliver and grow these services.
Geographically well located
Most of our operations are in the South East of the UK.This area is
forecast to have the highest economic and population growth rates
in the country.We have also started a small yellow school bus joint
venture in North America and will cautiously assess further
opportunities in this market.
Local high quality services
We operate a devolved management structure which provides a
strong local focus on our passengers and high quality
bus and rail services.
Responsible operator
Operating our companies in a safe, socially and environmentally
responsible manner is a vital part of our business. It is what we do
on a day-to-day basis and is deeply embedded across our
organisation at all levels.
Delivering shareholder value
We are committed to delivering shareholder value through our
clear and effective strategy. Maintaining the amount of dividend per
share through the economic cycle, including those times when
earnings may reduce, is a high priority for us and is supported by
our strong balance sheet and cash generation.

 Countrywide plc Annual Report 2015 04
Strategic report
Chairman’s review
In my second and final term as chairman 
of the Group, I am reporting following a 
significantly tougher year both for the market 
and Countrywide. 2015 was an uncertain 
year and we know that uncertainty does 
not breed confidence, a necessary factor 
to provide stimulus to the UK housing 
transaction market. The May general 
election was the most uncertain election 
in a generation and the anticipated 
post-election boost never materialised.
2015 results delivered income growth of 
4% to £733.7 million but EBITDA fell to 
£113.0 million. While lower than 2014’s 
performance, with poorer results in sales 
and lettings, these figures highlight the 
benefits we continue to derive from our 
broadly based diversification strategy with 
42% of Group EBITDA being delivered from 
Lettings and Commercial, our key recurring 
revenue streams. Other contributors to 
growth were our Financial Services and 
Surveying teams, two areas of the business 
which outperformed the market in 2015. 
In 2015, we confirmed that there would be 
no change to the underlying dividend policy 
which would target a payout ratio of 35–45% 
of the annual reported Group profits after 
tax but before amortisation. In recent years, 
the Group has paid 40% and I can confirm 
that the 2015 cash payment will be held at 
the previous year’s level. In February 2016, 
we sold 8,659,302 Zoopla shares realising 
£19.1 million which will be returned to 
shareholders by way of a share buyback 
programme. We continue to hold 9,234,473 
Zoopla ordinary shares. The Board has the 
potential to re-introduce special dividends 
from 2017. 
As announced on 11 February 2016, 
I am pleased that Peter Long will take over 
as non-executive chairman following the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting on 
27 April 2016. I am proud of my tenure at 
Countrywide and it was always my intention 
to only remain as chairman for a period of 
two years. I believe the time is now right to 
depart, with the arrival of Peter who brings 
a strong customer focus and a wealth of plc 
board experience, which will complement the 
Board’ s expertise and add value to Countrywide 
as it delivers its customer-centric strategy.
As noted in our January 2016 Trading 
Update, the Group achieved an encouraging 
performance in Q4 of 2015. While it is too 
early to accurately predict how the residential 
transactions market will perform in 2016, 
trends are encouraging with momentum 
building and strong pipelines. At this stage 
in the year, I am confident that the Group 
is in a good position to deliver in line with 
the Board’s expectations.

Profit Before Tax
The profit before tax for the year ended 
31 December 2007 was £5,047,000 
(2006: £3,751,000). However, the Directors
believe that an adjusted measure of profit
before tax and earnings per share provides
shareholders with a more appropriate
representation of the underlying earnings
derived from the Mavinwood Group’s
business. The items adjusted for in arriving at
that underlying level are as follows:
2007 2006

Emergency Repair 7,152 4,832
Document Handling 3,886 2,459

*** Excluding share based payments charge
The significant increase in sales and profit in
this division is principally due to the fact that
Independent Inspections and Mono Services
were only included for part of 2006 compared
to a full twelve months in 2007. The 2007
figures include Peter Cox for three months.  
This division includes three businesses which
serve principally the insured repair sector.
Approximately 80% of sales in 2007 were to
leading insurance companies and we also
service a range of housing associations and
commercial companies. Peter Cox currently
carries out little insurance work and most of
its sales leads come from referrals or
household directories.
All four businesses share a common business
process which is:
• Take the emergency call from the
customer or via an insurer
• Arrange a survey to validate or repudiate
the claim and cost out the repair
• Undertake the repair either by directly
employed labour or sub contractors
ANSA specialises in drainage surveys and
repair, Independent Inspections in flooring
surveys and restoration and Mono Services in
building fabric surveys and repairs, often due
to water damage.

Mavinwood plc
ANSA, Independent Inspections and Peter Cox
are national businesses and Mono Services is a
regional business in the North West.  
There is some customer overlap between the
businesses but one of our opportunities
moving forward is to offer all our services to a
wider range of customers.
All these businesses operate to high service
standards. Examples of customer satisfaction
measures that are monitored on a continuous
basis are:
• Response times in terms of contacting a
policyholder after they report an insured
event
• Courtesy of staff and customer satisfaction
• Average cost per claim
There are integration benefits to flow
between the businesses. A range of
integration projects are underway including:
• Optimising the IT platform across all the
operations
• Purchasing initiatives 
• Optimising back office functions
• Reviewing marketing opportunities and
widening the service offering
As well as good organic growth within the
division, we will continue to look for bolt on
acquisitions which would further enhance our
offering.
Turning to the highlights within each
operation:
ANSA
After a strong start to the year, ANSA’s volume
of insurance instructions dropped overall
comparing 2007 with calendar 2006. The heavy
flooding over the summer reduced the number
of blockages we needed to attend. This wet
weather was then followed by one of the
driest autumns on record. This had the effect
of reducing root ingress into the drains.
Without the build up of water a number of
householders would not have been aware their
drains were blocked. Right at the year end,
December saw a sharp drop in volumes. This
pattern was a feature of the whole drainage
industry in the second half of the year. 
ANSA did benefit from an improved mix of
business with an increased proportion of larger
jobs in 2007. 
During January and February 2008, volumes of
instructions received from the insurers have
returned back to the levels seen during the
first half of 2007. 
ANSA has extended its drainage services to a
wider range of customers in the commercial
sector. This is still a relatively small part of the
ANSA business but after extensive trialling in
2007 we have national coverage and are
growing a number of regional and national
accounts.
Operating profit at ANSA has increased due to
an improved mix of business, cost reductions
and productivity gains. Customers have
benefited from strong performance in claims
validation, service delivery and cost control.
From October we renewed a contract with one
leading insurer and this arrangement will run
for three years.
In February 2007, ANSA acquired ESG Limited,
a small drainage contractor for £0.2 million.
This acquisition has helped to increase the
proportion of repair work that is being carried
out by direct labour as opposed to sub
contractors.
ANSA also owned a small business offering
Health and Safety training. Revenue in the first
six months of 2007 was £617,000. The trade
and assets of this operation were sold to the
training management team on 29 June 2007 at
net book value of £556,000.

quarter, a series of cost reduction and profit

211679_pp04-pp11.qxp  18/3/08  19:09  Page 6 improvement initiatives were made. The
summer floods were positive for Independent
Inspections as a large number of floor
coverings were destroyed or damaged. New
income streams were developed later in the
year which has broadened the base of the
business.  
Mono Services
Mono Services sales have increased by
approximately one fifth compared to 2006
due to winning new business, helped by the
storm damage over the 2006/7 winter and
the summer floods. Some of Mono Services’
business has been re-directed via an insurer’s
joint venture partner that has caused some
disruption to our operations. This resulted in
transition and set up costs that reduced
margins during the year. 
The acquisition of Peter Cox with its network
of branches and its integration with Mono
Services will enable us to build a national
building fabric solution for insurers. 
Peter Cox
Peter Cox was acquired on 28 September
2007. It is a national provider of damp and
water proofing, timber preservation and wall
stabilisation for property in the United
Kingdom. Peter Cox has a network of 17
branches in England and Scotland and
employs 287 people. Its revenue is generated
from yellow pages and the commercial sector,
with at present little or no insurance work.
Peter Cox contributed revenue and operating
profit of £4.2 million and £0.3 million in its
first three months. Revenue was 6% up on
the comparable period and operating profit
significantly increased.
We commenced the integration of the back
office systems of Peter Cox into the
Emergency Repair division very promptly after
completion of the acquisition. This was partly
driven by the need to move out of the shared
services environment of the vendor group.
The central functions of Peter Cox have been
relocated to the same offices as ANSA and
Mono Services, in Oldham. During the last
quarter of 2007 there were double running
costs of operating the two environments plus
investment in the IT integration. We estimate
the double running and integration costs
incurred by Peter Cox and Mono Services
were £0.3 million in aggregate.
Emergency Repair Summary
Overall, on a true like for like basis
comparing each business with the
comparable period of trading in 2006, sales
advanced by 10% and operating profit by
18%. After a soft end to the year in volume
terms the division has bounced back in the
first quarter of 2008.
We have built a division which competes
effectively as  a claims fulfilment business for
insurance companies. We are integrating the
operations under one divisional management
team headed by Steve Watkins and
beginning to eliminate duplication in
function across the division. The
implementation of one IT platform across the
division will improve efficiency during 2008
and especially 2009. The integration of Peter
Cox with Mono Services will be a key
initiative for 2008.

Restore and Wansdyke
Restore and Wansdyke serve a wide range of
customers, including law firms, corporates of
varying sizes, financial services companies,
councils and health trusts. Our customers are
mostly based in London and the South across
to Bristol and South Wales. The majority of
sales are the storage and retrieval of archive
boxes but also individual files and other
material such as magnetic media and film. 
Scanning of documents on a selective basis is
also offered to clients. Shredding or pulping
of documents at the end of their useful lives is
currently outsourced, although this would
form a logical product extension.
The key customer satisfaction measures are:
• % accuracy in retrieving items
• % of items retrieved in accordance with
terms of service, such as same day or
next day delivery
We continue to integrate Restore and
Wansdyke and the companies share the same
management team. Approximately £0.1
million of integration costs have been charged
against Wansdyke’s profits in 2007. The
Restore operating system of bar coding is
being applied at Wansdyke and the back
office functions are increasingly being
integrated. Total employees at Wansdyke have
dropped from 75 at February 2006 to 66 at
31 December 2007 by natural wastage as
systems have become more automated.
We operate a combination of freehold and
leasehold sites at Wansdyke and Restore
respectively. Due to the absence of rental
charges, the return on sales at Wansdyke is
higher than that at Restore. 
Having repositioned the business in 2006,
Wansdyke’s sales grew strongly in 2007, by
10%. We are filling up our underground
storage facilities near Bath and in the first half
of 2007 acquired an adjoining underground
space of 16 acres for £0.5m. Once fitted out
this space will provide medium term
expansion for the business through to 2013.
Restore suffered from some disruption and
dealt with a high volume of archive box
intake but the flow through from this new
volume means it is well placed for 2008.
Document Control Services (DCS)
We acquired 100% of the share capital of
Stapledon Holdings Limited, the parent
company of DCS, on 26 March 2007. DCS is a
quality national operation, scanning and
indexing documents with high intellectual
property content. The business has a blue chip
customer base including Network Rail,
Highways Agency, The Crown Estate, oil and
gas companies, city councils and property
companies. DCS made a very strong
contribution in its first nine months.

211679_pp04-pp11.qxp  18/3/08  19:09  Page 8 Document Handling Summary
The market for the physical storage of
archives continues to grow well in excess of
GDP, with especially strong growth in sectors
such as professional services. Overall, on a
true like for like basis comparing each
business with a comparable period of trading
in 2006, sales advanced by 11% and
operating profit by 21%. 
The division is well placed to capitalise on its
pipeline of new business while maximising
the utilisation of its freehold space. Restore
and Wansdyke are effectively being run as
one business and the appointment of Ed
Marshall from DCS as divisional Chief
Executive will help to bind all three
operations together.
Central Costs
Central costs have increased from £969,000 to
£1,439,000 as we now operate two much
larger divisions compared to 2006. 
2007 has been a busy and exciting year for
Mavinwood and we anticipate yet another
year of building on our solid foundations in
2008.

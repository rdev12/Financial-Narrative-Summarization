Chairman’s statement
I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT OUR 
OPERATING PROFIT FOR THE YEAR 
INCREASED BY 38% TO £6.1 MILLION 
ON SALES WHICH GREW BY 12% TO 
£87 .1 MILLION.
Our agency and valuations business, 
Christie + Co, gave a robust performance. 
It continues to benefit from its focus on 
substantial but specialist business areas 
such as licensed, leisure, care and retail, 
to a depth of understanding that cannot  
be matched by any of our competitors. 
A particularly pleasing aspect of the  
year is that the European offices of 
Christie + Co came into profit for the first 
time, having achieved a 54% sales gain 
in the year. The first European office was 
opened nine years ago. Since that time, 
the growth of the European business has 
been supported by strong marketing aimed 
at developing the Christie + Co brand. We 
have also opened other offices in major 
national or regional centres and finally 
we have recruited and developed suitably 
skilled staff members. We now have eight 
offices in three countries (France, Spain 
and Germany). We believe the way ahead 
should prove less arduous. 
In aggregate, the Professional Business 
Services division produced a profit of  
£8.4 million on a turnover of £49.7 million. 
Our software solutions business produced 
an increased loss of £2.4 million. Whilst 
sales increased to £15.1 million, our new 
software was only available for pilot testing 
towards the end of this period, but we 
believe this should generate increasing 
sales orders as the year progresses. 
Our stocktaking division continued to grow, 
but as reported in my interim statement 
in what proved to be something of a 
transitional year, it incurred high training 
costs as part of re-equipping. We won our 
first major food retailer, Co-op, and we 
foresee good growth prospects for us in 
this sector.
In summary, professional business 
services and stock and inventory services 
together generated over £8.9 million 
operating profit and £11.6 million of 
cash. Continued investment in software 
development is programmed for 2007 
and 2008. We intend to meet such costs 
from our existing cash resources, without 
impinging on our ability to fund growth in 
our profitable divisions.
We have enjoyed a very good year, thanks 
to the commitment of our skilled teams, 
and we continue to see scope for further 
improvement.

supporting service organisations
Getronics Nederland BV
Acal Supply Chain Limited (ASC), the leading
independent provider of service part supply
chains in Europe, has signed a three-year
contract with Getronics in the Netherlands to
manage the supply and processing of spare
IT parts for their service organisation.
Building on a ten year trading relationship
across Europe, the contract covers the supply
and management of spare parts inventory and
the processing and repair of returns from the
field (“reverse logistics”).
With a diverse customer base, Getronics
Nederland BV’s service organisation maintains
and repairs a wide range of IT-based products.
ASC adds value by providing the appropriate
parts at the right time.
“Managing the availability of spare parts
inventory without overstocking is a constant
challenge. To be able to provide a lean ‘just in
time’ ﬁnancial model will reduce our internal
costs and aid our growth ambitions. ASC have
simplified this process for us by managing both
supply and logistics while improving the
availability of parts and reducing our stocks. ”

of our strategy in 2014 despite the difficult trading 
conditions. Here we review the key elements of 
our performance and outline the key challenges 
we will be facing in 2015. 
Strategic priorities

performance including the optimisation of inefficient space
• Improving store standards
• Opening new stores in target markets to grow sales and 
market share

2015 challenges
• UK consumer confidence has improved but the cost of living 
is still rising faster than real income

store footfall due to the channel shift

service, including fulfil-from-store

global markets

Russia and Libya

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
NICK SALMON
OVERVIEW
The Group’s performance continued to improve 
significantly in 2011. Continued market 
penetration of newly-developed products 
and the further expansion of our presence 
in developing markets have positioned our 
businesses favourably to benefit from the 
growth in our main end-markets. Accordingly, 
we have recorded strong progress towards 
achievement of the three year performance 
targets we announced in January 2011.
We announced on 23 February 2012 an 
agreement to sell the US Precious Metals 
Processing business which will result in us 
exiting this loss-making business on a cash 
neutral basis.
The challenging global macro-economic trends 
evident through the second half of 2011 had 
only limited impact on our businesses. As 
anticipated, we saw some softening in steel 
production trends in Europe and China in the 
fourth quarter, but momentum in our foundry 
and electronics end-markets was maintained 
through to year-end. For 2012, we anticipate 
mid-single digit growth globally in our main 
end-markets with generally weaker demand in 
Europe being offset by continued growth in the 
Americas and Asia-Pacific.
RENAMING OF THE DIVISIONS AND THEIR 
BUSINESSES
Over the last ten years there have been 
substantial changes in the Group’s portfolio 
and business model. Two of the four main 
businesses within the Electronics division, which 
together represented roughly half the division’s 
revenue in 2003, were sold by 2006. By 2007, 
another twelve smaller non-core businesses 
across the Group had been sold or closed and, 
in early 2008, we completed the major Foseco 
acquisition which was integrated within the 
Ceramics division. Our business model has 
evolved, placing much more emphasis on new 
product development and higher added-value 
products and services targeted to lift margins, 
gain market share and enter new end-market 
segments. As a consequence we have now 
decided to rename the Group’s three divisions 
and the businesses within each division to 
better reflect the value-added nature of their 
operations and the end-markets they serve: 
NEW NAMES PREVIOUS NAMES
Engineered Ceramics  Ceramics 
 Steel Flow Control Steel Flow Control
 Advanced Refractories Linings
 Foundry Technologies Foundry
 Fused Silica Fused Silica
Performance Materials Electronics 
 Joining Technologies  Assembly Materials
 Surface Chemistries Chemistry

divisions or businesses as a result of the name 
changes so segmental financial information 
remains comparable between periods.

Cookson Group plc  
Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011
TRADING PERFORMANCE
Group revenue of £2,826m was 11% higher, 
as reported, than 2010 in part reflecting the 
pass through to customers of significantly 
higher commodity metals prices for tin, silver 
and gold. On an underlying basis (at constant 
exchange rates and commodity metals prices), 
Group revenue increased by 9%, reflecting 
some market share gains and our favourable 
geographic market coverage, with almost 
half of revenue coming from higher growth 
developing countries. Trading profit of £290.2m 
was 15% higher than that reported for 2010, 
with around 60% coming from higher growth 
developing countries. Return on sales margin 
improved to 10.3% (2010: 9.9%). If commodity 
metals prices had remained at average 2010 
levels, the margin in 2011 would have been 
10.9%. 
The Engineered Ceramics division’s revenue of 
£1,686m was 13% higher than that reported 
in 2010 and 12% higher on an underlying 
basis. Within this, the steel production industry 
related businesses of Steel Flow Control and 
Advanced Refractories had revenue of £533m 
and £545m respectively, underlying increases 
of 8% and 11%, which compare favourably with 
growth in global steel production, as reported 
by the World Steel Association, of 6.8%. The 
Foundry Technologies business had revenue of 
£527m, nearly back to the levels recorded in the 
first half of 2008 prior to the start of the financial 
crisis, an underlying increase of 19%. For all 
three of these businesses, raw material costs 
rose significantly during the year, particularly 
graphite, zirconia and magnesite minerals. 
Whilst compensating selling price increases 
were agreed with customers during the course 
of the year, there was some time lag in their 
implementation which had a negative impact 
on margins. Revenue for the smaller Fused Silica 
business of £81m was 6% higher than 2010 for 
the year as a whole, having been 34% ahead at 
the half year, reflecting the previously reported 
sharp fall in demand for Solar Crucibles™ driven 
by excess global inventories of solar panels. 
Decisive steps have been taken to adapt to 
these conditions. In total, the division’s trading 
profit of £193.2m was 9% higher than the 
prior year and the return on sales margin was 
11.5% (2010: 11.9%). Excluding the Fused Silica 
business, the return on sales margin for the 
remaining Engineered Ceramics division was 
11.6% compared to 11.3% in 2010. 
The Performance Materials division’s revenue of 
£814m was 13% higher than 2010, as reported. 
In large part, this increase was due to the pass 
through of higher tin, silver and gold prices. 
On an underlying basis, revenue increased as 
expected by only 1%, reflecting the ongoing 
strategy of exiting more commoditised 
products (such as some types of lower margin 
bar solder), partly offset by continued market 
penetration of innovative, higher value-added 
and higher margin, products. As a result of 
this mix change, the division’s trading profit 
increased significantly to £99.6m, an increase of 
40% over that reported in 2010. The return on 
sales margin rose to 12.2% (2010: 9.8%). The net 
sales value for the division, being revenue less 
the value of tin and precious metals included in 
revenue, was £418m (2010: £410m), an increase 
of 2% and the return on net sales value was 
23.8% (2010: 17.3%).
The Precious Metals Processing division’s net 
sales value (being revenue excluding the 
precious metals content) of £132m decreased 
by 1%, as reported. The European business 
performed well throughout the year, benefiting 
from high levels of reclaimed precious metal 
processing and refining activity. As previously 
reported, having operated around break-even in 
the first half, the US business incurred significant 
losses through the second half. As a result the 
division’s overall trading profit in 2011 of £6.2m 
was £6.5m lower than in 2010. In November 
2011, we announced that we had initiated a 
strategic review and significant downsizing of 
the US operations. Subsequently we entered 
into negotiations with Richline Group, Inc. (a 
subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.) for it to 
acquire these US operations and on 22 February 
the parties signed a binding Sale and Purchase 
agreement, which is subject only to normal 
legal and regulatory closing provisions which 
we anticipate to be completed in the second 
quarter of 2012. The net cash consideration is 
subject to closing balance sheet adjustments, 
but is expected to be sufficient for the exit from 
the loss-making US business to be cash neutral, 
including the restructuring and other costs 
incurred in preparing the business for sale. The 
division’s profitable European operations are 
unaffected by the transaction.

EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS
A net charge, pre-tax, of £49.9m was incurred 
(2010: £32.7m), principally due to charges 
relating to amortisation of intangible assets 
(£17.8m), restructuring charges (£8.9m), finance 
costs (£1.9m), and loss on the disposal of 
businesses (£36.5m, of which £29.0m related to 
the US Precious Metals Processing business that 
was in the process of being disposed of at 
year-end). These charges have been partially 
offset by gains relating to employee benefits 
plans of £15.2m. Of the total net charge, £15m is 
cash-related and £35m is non-cash related. 
TAXATION
The tax charge on ordinary activities was 
£61.4m on headline profit before tax of 
£261.5m, an effective tax rate (before share of 
post-tax profit from joint ventures) of 23.5%. The 
effective tax rate in 2010 was 21.1%, as this 
reflected the benefit of a number of non-
recurring credits. The underlying effective tax 
rate for 2010 was around 24%. It is currently 
expected that the effective tax rate for 2012 will 
remain around 23.5%.
ATTRIBUTABLE PROFIT AND EARNINGS
Headline attributable profit was £194.2m (2010: 
£169.8m), an increase of 14%. Headline earnings 
per share was 70.4p (2010: 61.5p), also an 
increase of 14%.
After taking into account all exceptional items, 
the Group recorded a profit for the year of 
£146.8m compared with £145.3m for 2010.
PENSIONS
At 31 December 2011, the net deficit in the 
Group’s post-retirement defined benefits plans 
was £58.7m (31 December 2010: £113.8m). The 
significant improvement principally arose in 
respect of the Group’s UK pension plan. This 
reflected both strong gains for the plan assets 
arising from our investment and hedging 
strategies plus a gain in connection with the 
change in the UK inflation index (from RPI to 
CPI), more than offsetting the negative impact 
of lower discount rates used to value plan 
liabilities.
An enhanced transfer value exercise is currently 
ongoing in the UK and, as at 31 December 2011, 
a significant number of deferred members with 
liabilities totalling £37m had so far transferred 
out of the UK Plan. 
FINANCIAL POSITION
Net debt at 31 December 2011 was £364m, 
£34m higher than a year earlier. 
Trade working capital cash outflows were £61m 
in the year while reported revenue grew by 
£280m. Hence, the working capital to sales ratio 
increased to 23.1% (2010: 21.1%). Management 
action plans are in place targeted at improving 
working capital performance and we anticipate 
stronger cash generation in 2012. 
Capital expenditure of £85.1m (2010: £57.2m) 
was 1.5 times depreciation and included 
investments to expand our production capacity 
in higher growth markets, notably Brazil, India, 
China and Eastern Europe and in expanding and 
upgrading our R&D facilities. The net debt also 
reflects the acquisition of SERT for €11m (£9m) 
in November 2011.
In April 2011, the Group entered into a new 
£600m, five year revolving credit facility with a 
syndicate of banks to replace the existing 
£511m bank facility which was due to mature in 
October 2012. This followed the successful issue 
in December 2010 of US$250m of private 
placement loan notes with an average maturity 
of 8.7 years.
At 31 December 2011, the ratio of net debt to 
EBITDA was 1.1 times, very comfortably within 
the debt covenant level of 3.25 times, and the 
interest cover ratio was 15.1 times. The Group’s 
financial position is strong with ample liquidity 
under long-term financing arrangements.
OUTLOOK FOR 2012
While the macro-economic outlook remains 
uncertain, feedback from our customers and 
third party industry forecasters continues to 
indicate mid-single digit growth globally in our 
main end-markets in 2012, with generally 
weaker demand in Europe offset by continued 
growth in the Americas and Asia-Pacific. For the 
small Solar Crucibles™ business, we hope to see 
some recovery in the market in the second half 
of 2012, but are currently uncertain on the 
timing and rate of that recovery.
Both our Engineered Ceramics and Performance 
Materials divisions are well positioned to deliver 
further performance improvement based on 
their global market coverage, strong presence 
in higher growth developing markets, leading 
technologies and strong new product pipelines, 
high technical service element and value selling 
competence. The Board is confident of the 
Group’s ability to achieve further progress in the 
current year towards its 2013 targets, driving 
further value for shareholders.

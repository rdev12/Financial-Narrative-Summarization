Our performance
 These were exceptional results 
for the Group with a 67 per cent 
increase in proﬁ t before taxation 
and non-recurring costs to £126.2 
million (2008: £75.5 million) and 
continue a consistent growth trend 
for our business. The Group basic 
earnings per share before non-
recurring costs in the last four years 
have increased by a compound 
annual average of over 44 per cent. 
The principal drivers have been 
third generation formats with many 
products now having a wider 
demographic appeal, the further 
development of our specialist 
credentials, successful international 
expansion and the signiﬁ cant 
beneﬁ ts arising from our acquisition 
of Gamestation.
 We recognise the unusually challenging and 
uncertain economic conditions in which we are 
operating today, and whilst we are not immune 
to wider economic uncertainties, our record 
results during the crucial Christmas period 
provide reassurance about the appeal and 
resilience of the products we sell and therefore 
our business model. We continue to be 
encouraged by the ongoing demand for third 
generation products which is in part being 
driven by their broadening appeal. Video 
games and, in particular, our trade-in and 
preowned offers, which provide consumers 
with a way to buy games for less, offer an even 
more affordable alternative to many other 
family leisure activities. We remain committed 
to delivering our customers the widest choice 
and value for money.
Results
 Group turnover for the 53 weeks ended 
31 January 2009 increased by 32.2 per cent to 
£1,971.9 million (52 weeks ended 31 January 
2008: £1,491.9 million) with lﬂ  sales up by 
8.8 per cent. In the UK and Ireland, total sales 
increased by 25.7 per cent and lﬂ  sales were up 
by 10.7 per cent. In our International operations, 
total sales increased by 50.6 per cent and lﬂ  
sales rose by 4.6 per cent.
The Group’s gross margin improved by 140 basis 
points. The overall improvement was achieved 
through an increase in higher margin new and 
preowned software within the overall sales mix, 
which rose from 59.7 per cent to 62.2 per cent 
and purchasing synergies from Gamestation. 
In addition, later in the period, we delivered 
efﬁ ciency and gross margin improvements 
from our UK preowned business.
Group operating proﬁ t before non-recurring 
costs was £133.1 million (2008: £82.3 million). 
Proﬁ t before tax and non-recurring costs was 
£126.2 million (2008: £75.5 million) and basic 
earnings per share before non-recurring 
costs were 26.61p (2008: 15.88p).

Chairman’s statement
continued
Your Board is proposing a ﬁ nal dividend of 
3.71p per share, an increase of 25 per cent. 
This will result in a full year dividend of 5.50p, 
an increase of 25 per cent. 
Our net cash position as at 31 January 2009 
increased to £81.4 million (2008: £42.1 million). 
The Group continues to be very cash generative 
and has a strong balance sheet.
Business development
Our market and position
 We developed the key differentiators of our 
business to ensure we were well positioned 
ahead of the launch of the latest generation 
of formats:
  Our well established supplier relationships 
allow us to source appropriate quantities 
of “must have” new products and present 
innovative offers to our customers;
  GAME and Gamestation’s specialist retail 
proposition allow us to carry the widest 
range of product on the high street;
  Our well trained and knowledgeable 
employees are instrumental in guiding 
consumers to the products, deals and 
choices that best suit their needs;
  Our GAME Reward Card scheme has over 
12 million members; and
  Our trade-in programme and preowned 
product offer allow consumers to maximise 
their purchases from their available 
cash resources. 
In addition, we have opened stores in the 
right territories and the right locations. We now 
have 1,342 stores across two brands and ten 
countries, reﬂ ecting our strategy of building 
our business in the most appropriate markets.
We continue to invest in our multi-channel 
proposition to ensure we can deliver growth 
in the future and maintain our competitive 
position. Our strategy reﬂ ects customers’ 
increasing adoption of multi-channel shopping, 
and we have invested to ensure that the 
qualities of the GAME and Gamestation offer 
are replicated for our eCommerce customers.
We continue to target the Group’s resources 
towards those markets with the strongest 
return on investment characteristics and where 
we believe our expertise can deliver real 
improvements in performance. 
The third generation consoles are all in good 
supply. Demand has continued to be strong 
and the installed console base has now reached 
record levels at over 22.5 million in the key UK 
market. This level of console ownership has 
been achieved in just over three years, while 
second generation consoles took eight years 
to reach 17 million (source: GfK Chart Track).
An expanded base of hardware in the market 
leads to more software being sold, both to the 
more traditional gamer and to new customers 
entering the market for the ﬁ rst time. The 
consumer appeal of pc and video games is 
broadening with more women and families, 
younger children and more mature customers 
buying games in our stores. 
 “ Our record results during 
the crucial Christmas period 
provide reassurance about 
the appeal and resilience 
of the products we sell 
and therefore our business 
model.”

Our performance
 The UK and Ireland
The market
In the ﬁ nal quarter of the period we saw 
unprecedented changes to the retail landscape 
as some retailers of pc and video games 
ceased to trade. Consequently, we are actively 
focused on securing further proﬁ table market 
share and the early signs are encouraging.
We opened a net 47 stores in the UK and Ireland 
across our GAME and Gamestation brands.
Gamestation
In the UK, we are continuing to develop 
the distinctive dual brand position of GAME 
and Gamestation. 
We acquired Gamestation in May 2007 and 
received Competition Commission clearance 
in January 2008. We have been very pleased 
with the performance of the Gamestation 
business in the ﬁ rst full year under our control 
and it has again exceeded our expectations. 
We have continued to grow the Gamestation 
store portfolio with a focus on locations that 
are complementary to the GAME brand. 
We achieved ongoing synergies of £10 million 
in the 53 weeks ended 31 January 2009 of 
which around £8 million was a reduction in cost 
of sales with £2 million being a reduction in 
operating expenses. We are targeting a further 
£6 million of synergy beneﬁ ts for this year, giving 
an annualised rate of £16 million going forward. 
In order to achieve these synergies there will be 
a total non-recurring charge of approximately 
£16 million related to integrating the acquisition, 
of which £9.5 million has been incurred to 
date with £6.6 million in the 53 weeks ended 
31 January 2009 and £2.9 million in the prior 
year. In addition, the total capital expenditure 
required to integrate the acquisition will be 
£7 million of which £2 million has been incurred 
in the 53 weeks to 31 January 2009. 
Concessions
On 29 September 2008, GAME entered into an 
agreement with Borders to open 20 concessions 
within a number of their stores in the UK. This 
store-in-store concept, which is branded GAME, 
has broadened our consumer reach and will 
complement the GAME standalone stores and 
our other 32 concessions with retailers such as 
Debenhams, Selfridges, Hamleys and Fenwick. 
We will continue to review opportunities to 
expand the concession footprint.
International
The International business continues to perform 
well in all territories despite trading conditions 
deteriorating throughout the period, contributing 
29.6 per cent to the Group revenue and 16.1 per 
cent to operating proﬁ t. 
We opened a net 112 international stores this 
year with 16 of these in France, 45 in Iberia, 
47 in Australia and four in Scandinavia. 
As part of our international growth strategy 
we are continuing to buy-in or close existing 
franchises. During the course of the year, we 
completed the purchase of six of the remaining 
seven French franchise stores for a cost of 
€3.2 million (£2.9 million). We also bought 
in four of our Spanish franchises at a cost 
of €0.9 million (£0.8 million) and closed one. 
There are now only seven franchises within 
the Group.

 eCommerce
Our multi-channel proposition continues to 
evolve very successfully and our sales and 
operating proﬁ ts from eCommerce have grown 
85 per cent and 109 per cent respectively 
to £106.8 million (2008: £57.8 million) and to 
£6.1 million (2008: £2.9 million). Each of our 
International businesses is actively participating 
in this area. In the period, GAME invested 
£8 million in distribution infrastructure and 
further consumer facing development. 
Acquisitions
On 21 August 2008, GAME acquired the Czech 
video games retailer JRC Czech a.s. (“JRC”) for 
Czk112.0 million (£3.6 million) in cash of which 
Czk50.8 million (£1.6 million) was payable 
immediately and the balance is payable 
over the course of the next two years.
JRC, based in Prague, is the leading specialist 
retailer of pc and video games in the Czech 
Republic. JRC provides the opportunity to 
develop GAME’s international business in Central 
and Eastern Europe. The company now 
operates 22 specialist pc and video games 
stores, located in the principal cities in the 
Czech market including six stores in Prague, 
and a transactional eCommerce site 
www.jrc.cz. It is the leading retailer in the market 
with market share in excess of 15 per cent. JRC 
has a committed management team with 
more than 15 years of experience.
The Czech business has contributed £0.5 million 
to Group operating proﬁ ts in the year.
Treasury and capital expenditure
Our net cash, as at 31 January 2009, was 
£81.4 million compared with £42.1 million in the 
prior year. The increase was driven by strong 
operating cash ﬂ ows.
In the 2009/10 ﬁ nancial year average net 
debt is anticipated to be around £64 million 
(2008: £67 million). The Board is committed 
to an efﬁ cient capital structure and continues 
to review the dividend policy and a share 
buyback strategy along with continued organic 
or acquisitive growth of the store portfolio.
We anticipate that our total capital expenditure 
for the current year will be around £35 million 
(FY08/09: £53 million). Store openings, 
refurbishment and information technology 
requirements are expected to cost approximately 
£25 million. In addition we expect to spend 
£5 million on eCommerce development and 
£5 million on the Gamestation integration.
The Board
On 3 July 2008, Dennis Woodside (40) was 
appointed as a Non Executive Director. 
Mr Woodside is a senior executive of Google 
and is presently the head of their North and 
South American operations. 
On 13 January 2009, Terry Scicluna (51) was 
appointed to the Board as Chief Operating 
Ofﬁ cer – UK and Ireland. Terry joined GAME on 
15 October 2008 and has 30 years of experience 
in retail including the management of multiple 
brands. His appointment adds further strength 
to the management team.

Our performance
Employees
Our employees, at all levels, have worked 
tirelessly to engage with our customers, provide 
outstanding customer service and have 
contributed to a great ﬁ nancial performance 
through their signiﬁ cant efforts and enthusiasm. 
It is an enormous tribute to all of our employees 
that GAME was awarded the prestigious accolade 
of Speciality Retailer of the Year 2008 at the 
Retail Week Awards in March 2009. On behalf 
of myself and the Board, I would like to thank 
all of our employees for contributing to 
our success.
Corporate Responsibility 
Corporate Responsibility (“CR”) is right at 
the heart of GAME. As a responsible retailer, 
we recognise that the way we operate as a 
business has a direct impact on our reputation 
and our brand. We are continuing to develop 
our CR strategy and our stakeholder relationships.
Current trading and future prospects
We have made a very encouraging start to the 
ﬁ nancial year particularly given that the strong 
comparative period in 2008 (when Group lﬂ  
sales were 18 per cent) was driven by the 
launch of a number of popular software titles 
such as Mario and Sonic at the Olympic 
Games and Mario Kart Wii.
In the ﬁ rst 11 weeks to 18 April 2009 the Group’s 
total sales were up by 1.0 per cent and lﬂ  
sales were down by 6.3 per cent. The lﬂ  sales 
reduction is less than we had anticipated 
and the demand remains strong.
In the UK and Ireland, total sales and lﬂ  sales 
were down by 2.4 per cent and 6.6 per cent 
respectively. In our International business, 
total sales were up by 9.9 per cent and lﬂ  sales 
on a constant currency basis were down 
by 5.7 per cent. On a reported currency basis, 
Group lﬂ  sales were down by 3.7 per cent.
Current trading performance is ahead of our 
expectations and this is particularly pleasing 
when set against the double digit growth 
achieved last year. Year to date margin has 
also improved, up 150 basis points as a result 
of higher margin products within the sales mix. 
As a result of these factors, we anticipate gross 
margin for the full year will improve by 150 to 
175 basis points compared to last year.
The unprecedented range of products has 
broadened the demographic appeal of 
gaming, attracting new customers from all 
generations. With a large and growing installed 
base of hardware in the market and a solid 
line up of new software launches, the Board 
is conﬁ dent in the outlook for the year to 
31 January 2010.

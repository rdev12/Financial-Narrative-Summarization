Our business 
Synergy’s core services are the sterilisation of 
medical devices, infection control and environmental 
management services, and other niche outsourced 
services such as laboratory services (pathology, 
toxicology, food testing and microbiology). 
Synergy’s strategy in these markets, the majority of 
which are regulated with high barriers to entry, is to 
gain consolidated, competitive positions with scale 
beneﬁts which enable it to leverage pricing power  
with cost leadership programmes. 
In addition, through the quality of its management 
team and the skills of its staff, Synergy seeks to offer a 
differentiated service from its competitors, focusing on 
customers’ desired outcomes and business solutions. 
Our markets 
Synergy’s four regions provide us with a mix of 
established markets, where we continue to invest 
and improve our service offer to our customers, 
and growth markets, where we are establishing a 
signiﬁcant presence and building a strong reputation

a trusted sterilisation provider.

chairman’s statement
I am pleased to report a year of significant progress with a strong
return to overall profitability following the Group’s shift in strategic
focus to a specialist model. The return to profitability has been
achieved through a combination of strong sales growth, increasing
gross margins, better operational efficiency and delivery of the
planned integration synergies arising from the acquisition of BFi
Optilas (“BFi”) in December 2009.
Strategy and acquisitions
The Group strategy of Electronics specialisation has made
significant progress over the last two years. The Board believes
that this strategy will continue to provide further opportunities
for growth and increased shareholder value, adding market share
through a combination of organic growth and selective value
enhancing acquisitions.
The first acquisition since BFi was acquired in December 2009 was
completed in January 2011, with the acquisition of CompoTRON
GmbH (“Compotron”). Compotron has enhanced the Group’s
position in the German specialist electronics market and its
performance since acquisition has been very encouraging.
On 1 June 2011 the Board was pleased to announce the
acquisition of Hectronic AB, a Swedish specialist electronics
business, for a consideration of £1.2m. Hectronic is a specialist
provider of embedded computing technology to industrial
electronic markets and generates revenues across the Nordic
region. We are delighted to welcome them into the Group.
Results
Group revenue for the year increased by 46% to £264.8m (2009/10:
£181.6m) driven by strong like for like sales growth, up 21% over
last year.
Underlying profit before tax was £7.1m, compared to a loss of £0.9m
in the prior year. The second half of the year saw underlying profit
before tax increase 73% sequentially to £4.5m (H1 2010/11: £2.6m).
Exceptional costs for the year totalled £4.4m (2009/10: £4.7m)
comprising £3.6m in respect of the BFi integration, and other net
costs of £0.8m principally related to the completion of the Supply
Chain division integration and the acquisition of Compotron.
Including exceptional items, earn-out costs, amortisation of
acquired intangibles and IAS 19 pension finance charge, IFRS
reported profit before tax was £1.9m (2009/10: loss of £6.3m).
Underlying diluted earnings per share were 18.6 pence
(2009/10: loss per share of 6.3 pence). Including underlying
adjustments, fully diluted earnings per share were 5.7 pence
(2009/10: loss per share of 24.5 pence).
The balance sheet remains robust with net assets at the year end
of £51.3m (2009/10: £51.9m) including net cash of £6.7m (2009/10:
£13.9m). Year end cash balances reduced primarily due to the
acquisition of Compotron and the cost of restructuring and
integrating BFi. The Group has in place committed long term
working capital facilities to manage the inter-month working
capital movements which resulted in net average borrowings
during the final quarter of £0.5m. At the year end, these facilities
amounted to approximately £20m. 03

Integration of BFi
The integration of BFi was completed during the year, delivering
the planned annualised synergies of £4.4m (€5.3m). Operations in
the Electronics division are now on one common infrastructure
with a single management information system, common logistics
and purchasing, while central warehouses have been reduced from
three to two. Offices have been rationalised where appropriate,
with five closures, and management teams have been combined.
There is now one principal legal entity in each country, securing
long term access to approximately £18m of tax losses. Exceptional
costs for the integration totalled £6.0m (£3.6m this year and £2.4m
in 2009/10), in line with the amount originally anticipated.
Dividend
The Board continues to keep dividend policy under review and is
cognisant of the importance of dividends to shareholders. In
setting future dividends, the Board will take account of available
financial resources, current trading conditions, the prospects for
the Group and the level of dividend yield and cover.
At the half year, the Directors declared an interim dividend of
2.33 pence per share (H1 2009/10: 2.33 pence per share). The
Board is now recommending an increased final dividend of
5.14 pence per share being a 10% increase compared to the prior
year final dividend of 4.67 pence per share, and providing a
dividend for the year of 7.47 pence per share, a 6.7% increase
overall. The dividend is payable on 29 July 2011 to shareholders on
the register as at 17 June 2011.
Board and employees
As reported at the time, Simon Gibbins joined the Board in July
2010 as Group Finance Director. Prior to joining Acal, Simon was
Global Head of Finance and Deputy CFO of Shire plc. Simon’s
experience in a specialist business that achieved rapid organic and
acquisitive growth, positions the Group well to address the
opportunities and risks it faces as the Group continues to develop.
This year has seen employees face an enormous integration and
restructuring workload as well as the positive pressures of strong
sales growth. They have managed both admirably, being a credit
to both themselves and the Company. On behalf of the Board, I
would like to thank them for their significant effort and
contribution.
The year ahead
Our strategy remains unchanged as we continue to build Europe’s
leading specialist electronics distributor. Against a backdrop of
improving global economic conditions and a recovering industrial
manufacturing marketplace, the Board remains confident of
further opportunities for both organic and acquisitive growth.

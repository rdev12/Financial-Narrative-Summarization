We are delighted to report that 2013 has been another year of 
significant progress for Tyman plc. 
During 2013 the Group has made further strides towards our 
strategic aim of becoming the leading supplier of components to 
the door and window industry and, following the acquisition of 
Truth, we are now the leading player in the North American 
residential window and door components market. 
This progress has been achieved through a combination of organic 
growth in our core US and UK businesses of Amesbury and 
Grouphomesafe, together with the acquisition of Truth – which has 
increased the size of our North American business by approximately 
40 per cent. As expected, Schlegel International had a more 
challenging year, reflecting difficult markets and the necessary 
investment made in consolidating its manufacturing footprint and 
management structures; however, we are confident that we now 
have the right platform for growth.
Truth has made a strong contribution to the Group in the first six 
months of our ownership, despite Canadian market activity levels 
that were much lower than in recent years, giving us confidence for 
further improvements over the course of 2014. 
Tyman has gone through a great deal of change over the course of 
the last four years and particularly in the last 12 months. The change 
of name in February of 2013 heralded the start of a significant 
period of corporate activity for the Group involving the raising of 
new debt and equity to finance the acquisition of Truth, the move 
from AiM to the Main List of the London Stock Exchange and the 
integration of Truth into our North American business. Since the year 
end we have also completed the acquisition of Vedasil Brasil. 
Managing that change has been a fundamental part of the good 
governance of Tyman and the Board has been closely involved in 
ensuring that the Group’s decision-making processes take into 
account the relevant interests of each of our stakeholders – 
shareholders, providers of finance, employees, customers as well as 
the wider environment.
Corporate developments and strategy 
Four years ago we set out a clear strategy outlining the actions that 
we would seek to take to reshape the Group and rebuild confidence 
with each of our stakeholders. 
A key element of that strategy was to develop our portfolio of 
products in our principal markets. In line with that strategy, we 
announced our intention to acquire Truth, the leading North 
American manufacturer of casement hardware, in May 2013. This 
transaction greatly extended our product offering, enabling us to 
offer a full range of components to our customer base, as well as 
allowing us an operating facility in Canada for the first time.
Chairman’s statement
Our core businesses have continued to deliver a 
solid performance and we have grown our market 
shares in both the US and the UK. Tyman plc

Financial statements
The acquisition completed on 3 July 2013, and we have been 
pleased with the progress made towards the integration of the two 
businesses, as a result of the commitment of teams from both 
Amesbury and Truth. Substantial progress has been made with 
regard to the delivery of synergies identified at the time of the 
acquisition, such that we now have significantly upgraded these 
synergy targets by some 60 per cent. We now have a single 
leadership team for our North American business, comprising 
individuals drawn from both Truth and Amesbury and a combined 
sales and marketing organisation under the leadership of an 
external hire.
Over the past 12 months we have strengthened the organisational 
and management structures in each of our divisions to reflect the 
increased size of the Group and to accord with the greater scope 
and potential of the enlarged businesses. The extent to which we 
have deepened and strengthened our management team across 
the Group is best illustrated by the fact that nearly half of the 
individuals who were awarded LTIP grants in 2013 joined Tyman, 
whether through acquisition or through recruitment, since the date 
of the last grant in July 2012.
Trading performance
Throughout this transformational period, our core businesses have 
continued to deliver a solid performance and we have grown our 
market shares in both the USA and the UK. 
For 2013 we have reported a 30.3 per cent increase in revenue and 
a 40.9 per cent increase in underlying operating profit. Underlying 
earnings per share have increased by 33.0 per cent to 13.71 pence 
and the Truth acquisition was earnings enhancing in the first six 
months of ownership.
The Group as a whole has delivered a material improvement in its 
return on average capital employed of 180 basis points to 9.0 per 
cent, with Truth making a positive contribution in the first six 
months of ownership, much earlier than we expected at the time of 
its acquisition.
Our cash flow performance in the year was excellent, with the Group’s 
leverage of 1.81x at the year end being significantly below the 
expected leverage of 2.00x we announced at the time of the 
acquisition, and well within our core target range of 1.50x to 2.00x. 
Operating cash conversion of 111.9 per cent (2012 restated: 83.6 per 
cent) reflects the tight management of the working capital cycle by 
the divisions despite the increased investments in capital expenditure 
made during 2013.
Dividend
The Board considers the dividend to be an important component of 
shareholder returns and accordingly, is recommending a final 
dividend for 2013 of 4.50 pence per share (2012: 3.50 pence per 
share) which, together with the interim dividend of 1.50 pence per 
share, gives a total dividend for the year of 6.00 pence per share 
(2012: 4.50 pence per share). 
This represents an increase of 33.3 per cent over the prior year and 
a cover of approximately 2.29x in relation to our 2013 underlying 
earnings per share – in line with our policy of cover of between 
2.00x and 2.50x through the cycle. 
Looking forward
In conclusion, I would like to thank all Tyman’s employees, 
especially those who have joined the Group in the past year, for the 
substantial efforts they have made to deliver these results, in what 
has been a very exciting and challenging year. 
In 2014, we look forward to delivering further significant progress.

 Chairman’s statement
Jacques Vert Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 5
The trading environment has been
difficult over the last year which has
affected most areas of the retail
market and against that background
I believe that our brands have
performed well.
Profit before tax for the year of
£5.3 million compares with a profit
of £5.1 million in the prior year. We
have made pleasing progress in
developing the ecommerce business
and it is also worth noting the
Jacques Vert and Precis brands have
both performed particularly strongly.
Our international business also
delivered encouraging growth.
On the operational front we have
taken significant steps forward and
the ongoing investment programme
in new systems and infrastructure
will position us well for the future.
The return to the dividend list
last year was well received by
shareholders and I am pleased to
report the Board is proposing an
increased final dividend of 3% to
0.67p per share in respect of the
year ended 30 April 2011. 
I believe that this financial year
will be challenging but I am pleased
with the start we have made and I
am confident that the business is
well positioned to benefit from any
improvement in the market.
Finally, I would like to extend my
thanks on behalf of the Board to all
our staff for their contribution and
support through the year.

 “We have a strong
team of dedicated
people providing first
class services to an
expanding list of high
quality customers.”
Overview
We are pleased to report trading
results which are ahead of
expectations, further substantial
reductions in net borrowings and a
positive outlook for the year ahead.
This has been achieved against a
difficult backdrop, with most UK-
based manufacturers, including both
our customers and competitors,
facing tougher market conditions
as volumes and margins come
under continued pressure.
By contrast, rapid development of
the Pearl River delta area of South
Eastern China for both sourcing and
OEM inward investment has fuelled
excellent growth in turnover and
earnings at Stadium Asia.
Within the group results from
continuing activities we have also
borne the effects of a weakening
US dollar and additional costs
associated with the funding of 
UK pension obligations.
Results and dividend
Profit before tax, goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items
from continuing activities was 
£1.22 million, based on operating
profits up 59% to £1.49 million
(2001: £0.93 million) less interest
costs of £267,000 (2001: £939,000).
Earnings from these activities was
more than doubled to 4.0 pence 
per share from 1.9 pence. Basic
earnings, after the impact of
discontinued activities, disposals
and goodwill amortisation, were a
loss of 3.0 pence per share against
a loss of 28.3 pence in 2001. 
This reflects the final phase of
implementation of the June 2001
strategic review and further
exceptional costs are anticipated 
to be minimal.
Net borrowings were reduced by
£6.57 million to £4.52 million to give
gearing of 36%. These figures are
expressed without allowing for
deferred consideration receivable
totalling £2.30 million, including
£1.02 million during 2003. Adjusted
gearing net of deferred
consideration was 18%.
The Board proposes a final dividend
of 1.85 pence per share, bringing
the total for the year to 2.8 pence
(2001: 2.8 pence). The final dividend
will be payable to shareholders on
the register on 4 April 2003 and will
be paid on 5 May 2003.

Electronics “We have continued
to invest . . .
attracting more
complex projects.”
Turnover at Stadium Asia increased
by 45% to £11.71 million, and
operating profits increased eight-fold
to £0.78 million. These results were
especially strong in view of the ten
per cent depreciation of the Hong
Kong Dollar relative to sterling during
the year. The increase in turnover is
attributable to the full annual impact
of major automotive and consumer
products contracts won in 2001, 
and the introduction of new
customers including a leading
producer of domestic appliance
controls.
The rapid introduction of new
business brought capacity utilisation
to around 60%, with resulting
benefits in operational gearing. 
We have continued to invest in
developing the capability of the
business, and this is attracting more
complex projects. The level of new
business won towards the end of
the year gives us confidence that
strong growth can be sustained 
in the coming year.
Negotiations are ongoing to
incorporate a new subsidiary in
the Peoples Republic of China with
domestic selling rights. This will
place Stadium in a strong position 
to exploit major opportunities 
in high growth consumer,
telecommunications and automotive
markets in the region.
UK electronics achieved results
slightly better than break even
despite a decline in turnover of 
15% to £13.77 million. This
reduction reflects the continuing
difficult conditions for UK based
manufacturers. Exceptional costs 
of £0.39 million were borne in
closing a number of sites, and our
UK headcount in electronics fell by
almost half from 529 to 275.
Our businesses in the UK are 
lean and well managed, and 
remain an important part of our
service offer to customers, both
in their own right and as a gateway
to Stadium Asia.

Plastics – continuing activities
Operations at Chingford were able

performance.
Investment in additional plastic

turn of the year should provide the
opportunity to maintain progress. Chief Executive’s review continued

Annual Report and Accounts 2002
“ample financing for
future growth”
Balance sheet and cash flow
The full benefits of our restructuring
are now apparent, with major
reductions in fixed and working
capital flowing into dramatically
reduced borrowings. This provides
ample financing for the future
growth of the business, and will
lead to even lower interest costs 
in 2003.
In November 2002 the net
borrowings of the group were
revised to include a US dollar
denominated loan which provides 
a hedge against US dollar linked
assets held in Asia. This provided a
benefit of £0.12 million to reserves
in 2002 and is expected to largely
eliminate further exposure in 2003.
Pensions
During the year the two principal
defined benefit schemes, which
have been closed to new entrants
since 1996, were combined, and a
triennial actuarial review was carried
out as at 7 April 2002.
The resulting charge to profit and
loss account was £0.20 million of
normal contributions for the full
year, and a further £0.26 million
of additional contributions
(representing nine months) to
reflect the accumulated deficit.
This compares to a net pension
credit of £0.11 million in 2001, and
the full cost has been expensed
against continuing activities.
Current trading and prospects
Sales for the current year to date 
at Stadium Asia are substantially
higher than the corresponding
period last year, and the order book
is at a high level. Operations in the
UK remain under some pressure
but we are trading at levels
comparable with last year.
The rate of new business coming
into Asia, and the potential yet to be
realised in the domestic Chinese
market, gives us confidence both in
the short and long term future of
the group.

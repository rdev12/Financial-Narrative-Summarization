Severn Trent Water provides high quality water 
and sewerage services to over 3.7 million 
households and businesses in the Midlands  
and mid-Wales.
Our industry
The water industry in England and Wales 
invests more than £3 billion a year and 
employs over 27,000 people. There are 10 
regional water and sewerage companies in 
England and Wales. We are seeking ways  
to address the long term challenges the 
industry faces, including the possible 
introduction of water trading and other 
measures to improve the national distribution 
of water (see ‘Our industry’ page 6).
Our prices
Every five years, Ofwat, our economic 
regulator, sets annual price limits for each 
water company which determine how 
much income we collect from our 
customers. These five year cycles are 
referred to as Asset Management Plan 
(AMP) periods. We have just reached the 
end of the period 2005–10 (AMP4) and are 
about to enter our next five year regulatory 
period (AMP5). The price limits for 
2010–15 were set in November 2009  
(see ‘Focusing on the next regulatory 
period’ on page 9).
Our performance
Like all water companies we submit a 
detailed annual breakdown of our 
performance to Ofwat each June, known 
as the June Return. This information 
enables Ofwat to monitor and compare 
water companies’ performances.
Our performance is also regulated by the 
Drinking Water Inspectorate, which is 
responsible for ensuring that we comply 
with drinking water quality regulations  
and the Environment Agency, which 
controls water abstraction, river pollution 
and flooding.
In addition, we work closely with other 
agencies, such as the Department for 
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 
(Defra), the Consumer Council for Water 
and Natural England as we aim to achieve 
the highest customer service and 
environmental standards, while offering our 
customers the lowest possible prices.

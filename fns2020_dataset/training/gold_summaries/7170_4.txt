FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS IN 2013
HIGHLIGHTS
We have delivered a resilient ﬁnancial performance 
against the backdrop of fragile market conditions, 
highlighting the strength of our diverse business 
model and our ability to react quickly to fast-
changing markets. At the Group level, both net fees 
and operating proﬁt were down 1%
(1)
, and our cash 
performance was good, with 109% conversion of 
operating proﬁt into operating cash ﬂow
(5)
. Earnings 
per share decreased 6%
(3)
, reﬂecting the lower 
operating proﬁt, higher net ﬁnance charge and  
higher effective tax rate. 
Our fee performance was driven by our Continental Europe &  
Rest of World (CE&RoW) division where, although markets 
remained mixed, we delivered strong net fee growth of 10%
(1)
.  
This included 13%
(1)
 growth in Germany; one of 13 countries which 
delivered net fee growth of over 10%
(1)
. In the UK & Ireland (UK&I),  
net fees were down 1%
(1)
, but we returned this division to proﬁt  
due to the successful delivery of our cost reduction programme.  
In Asia Paciﬁc, net fees decreased 13%
(1)
 as we experienced  
tough conditions in our Australian business, notably a signiﬁcant 
step-down in activity in mining-focused areas.
Group consultant headcount was ﬂat year-on-year
(4)
. We remained 
focused on controlling costs and driving consultant productivity 
around the Group, took action to cut costs where market conditions 
deteriorated and selectively invested to drive growth in stronger areas.

and we saw net fee declines in Asia Paciﬁc, 
this was largely offset by strong growth  
in our CE&RoW division.
Operating proﬁt down 1%

Resilient operating proﬁt performance, 
including a return to proﬁt in the UK, due to 
ﬁrm cost control and selective investment 
approach.

capital management.

 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
14 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’SREVIEW GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT |  2001/2002 15
We regard these inter-related strategies to be the critical
success factors for a tenanted and leased pub business. High
quality properties in good trading locations are essential to
attract the best licensees, while the latter are essential for
ensuring that the business prospers and grows. Finally, a
strong support package and keenness to invest in the fabric of
the estate is important to support the business plans of our
tenants and lessees, and improve their ability to succeed
against their competitors.
The competition for good licensees is intense, given the
significant number of managed pubs currently being
transferred to tenancy across the industry. Fortunately, our
strategy and estate quality is allowing us to attract a
disproportionate share of the best licensees and so maximise
our ability to exploit our trading potential. The success of
this approach is also recognised nationally, with Pub Partners
winning recognition as the ‘Publican’ newspaper’s ‘Tenanted
Pub Company (over 100 outlets) of the Year’ for an
unprecedented second consecutive year.
Brewing and Brands
The financial performance of our beer brands and wholesaling
business was highly positive despite a further intensification in
competitor activity. Turnover rose by 5 per cent to £91.9
million and trading profit by 3 per cent to £11.9 million.
The continued growth in sales of our own brands to major 
on-trade and take-home national accounts customers was
responsible for the slight reduction in trading profit margin
from 13.2 to 12.9 per cent, despite further improvements in
operational efficiency levels. However, the business achieved a
22 per cent return on its invested capital, over twice our cost
of finance, which was a tremendous result.
The continued prosperity of the division is predicated on the
success of our four principal beer brands: Greene King IPA,
Abbot Ale, Old Speckled Hen and Ruddles County. These
brands are leading players within their respective segments of
the traditional beer market and we intend to develop each of
them into strong leadership positions at the expense of their
competitors. This will be done by strengthening their
consumer franchise through consistent marketing support
rather than by over-aggressive discounting, although we
recognise the need to be price competitive.
The year saw high levels of marketing activity in line with
this strategy. Following consumer research, Ruddles County
in cask was repositioned at the start of the year in the mid-
gravity sector, with improved brand presentation and new
advertising, and achieved a big rise in volume.
Old Speckled Hen, which was returned to growth in
2000/01 after having been in decline when we acquired
Morland, benefited from consistent support and registered a
volume increase of 22 per cent, making an excellent 41 per
cent rise over the past two years. Old Speckled Hen is now
clearly established as the nation’s number one premium
bottled ale and is enjoying strong growth in cask as it further
differentiates itself from its competitors.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’SREVIEW 17
Greene King IPA is our flagship beer brand and its continued
health is of critical importance to us. Although the brand
achieved 4 per cent growth during the year, we undertook a
review of what we need to do in future to strengthen further
its consumer franchise. We consequently introduced in the
latter part of the year a radically different advertising
campaign designed to appeal to a broader customer base
without alienating existing consumers. Early results are
encouraging, with Greene King IPA’s pace of growth
increasing in the final months of the year.
Abbot Ale enjoyed its sixth consecutive year of growth with
a 12 per cent gain. A review of future brand strategy conducted
during the year to maintain this growth led to the introduction
of a new brand presentation in terms of both packaging and
advertising, with the intention of further enhancing the
brand’s appeal. Again, the early customer response is very
encouraging with the gaining of additional distribution and a
strengthening of its rate of growth.
The continued progress of our brands enabled us to register
further advances in market share at the expense of our
competitors and to achieve a 5 per cent increase in total own
brewed sales against a market ahead by 1 per cent. This success
is firmly rooted in the consumer appeal of our brands and the
ability of our sales teams to grow distribution, and is
demonstrated by the fact that less than one pint in four of our
own beer is sold through our pub estate, with the balance sold
to external customers. These factors, combined with our proven
strategy, will ensure that Brewing & Brands remains a successful
competitor and important creator of value for our shareholders.
Old English Inns
In this year of acquisition, we are reporting Old English Inns
separately, with the exception of those 13 outlets which
transferred to lease before the year end, so as not to distort
the results of the core business during the initial period of
rationalisation. Old English contributed a trading profit of
£1.7 million on turnover of £36.3 million in its 33 weeks
within the group from the 118 outlets remaining at the end
of the year.
During this period, Old English was subject to an intense
rationalisation programme involving the following activities:
• closure and sale of its head office
• integration of its IT systems 
and supply chain infrastructure
• sale of 5 non-strategic outlets
• letting of up to 32 outlets as tenancies or leases
• start of an investment plan to improve 
the quality of the retained properties.
This process anticipated a considerable disruption to the
trading of the business and margins only started to rise in the
last weeks of the year as the integration synergies began to
come on stream. We anticipate the retained Old English
outlets achieving margins closer to those in the core business
in 2002/03 now that the integration work is largely complete
and the rationalisation process well advanced.
The next challenge is to raise the trading performance by
pursuing our investment plan for Old English Inns in order to
ensure that the quality of its fabric and service standards meet
the high expectations of its affluent customer base. We are
confident that we will be able to generate attractive returns
from Old English’s fundamentally excellent trading sites as we
undertake the development programme over the next two
years and that, once this is completed, the business will prove
a valuable and sustainable addition to our portfolio.

16 GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT |  2001/2002
The well-run pub now has a broader
consumer appeal than ever before
and is
uniquely
well-suited
to the
expectations
of today’s
demanding
customers FINANCIAL REVIEW
18 FINANCIAL REVIEW GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT |  2001/2002 19
Focusing on our economic
fundamentals enables us to deliver
a virtuous circle of increasing
shareholder value and investing to
satisfy our
customers’
rising
expectations
Double digit growth
We have again delivered strong growth in
shareholder income. Indeed, comparable
earnings per share have increased at a
compound rate of 10 per cent over the
last five years and dividends by 11 per
cent. This is in line with our strategy of
growing earnings at a sustained, superior
rate whereby we offer investors an attractive dividend, which is
well covered and increasing. We are pleased with our
achievements, which are reflected in the table overleaf.
Strong cash flow
Cash is the life-blood of our business and this year our free
cash flow, struck after deducting interest, tax and dividends,
amounted to £58.5 million. At this level, we have every
opportunity to invest in our current business, buy other
compatible businesses, pay dividends and selectively buy back
shares. The strength of our cash flow and balance sheet was
sufficient to enable us to fund the purchase of Old English
Inns during the year and, since the balance sheet date,
Morrells of Oxford, using internal resources rather than
looking to our shareholders for additional funds.
Property value
Most of the cash we generate is channelled into our pub
estate, which is mainly freehold and accounts for the lion’s
share of our fixed asset base. Our fixed assets, whose balance
sheet value amount to £810.8 million, provide fundamental
long-term security for our debt providers, to whom we owe
less than half of this amount.
Focus on economic fundamentals
Our business’ focus is to deliver superior like for like profits, to
achieve returns ahead of the cost of capital and to drive down
real unit costs. Growth in economic profit is our principal aim,
whereby profit is only struck once capital employed has itself
been costed. We are convinced that our focus on economic
fundamentals creates significant shareholder value.
Treasury
Our net debt was £387.9 million, higher mainly due to the
acquisition of Old English Inns for £104.8 million. Our interest
cover, nevertheless, improved to 3.9 times demonstrating that
our borrowings are simple to service. Furthermore, we
increased the proportion of our borrowings that are fixed or
hedged to 82 per cent in order to protect ourselves against rises
in interest rates. A 1 per cent increase in short-term interest
rates now adds just £0.7 million to interest costs compared to
£3.9 million were none of the borrowings fixed or hedged.
Further details are provided in note 22 to the accounts.
New accounting standards
We have implemented the FRS 19 accounting standard on
deferred tax for the first time and as a result our effective rate
of tax has increased from 24 to 31 per cent, 1 per cent higher
than the underlying rate of tax. Further details are provided
in note 9 to the accounts.
We have also implemented the initial transition arrangements
for the FRS 17 accounting standard on retirement benefits. If
FRS 17 had been fully implemented, net assets would have
reduced by £18 million, reflecting unfunded pension
liabilities, which will be made good in future years. Further
details are provided in note 7 to the accounts.
Goodwill and exceptional items
Our profit and loss account continues to separate out
amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items to highlight
the underlying performance of the business. Amortisation of
goodwill amounted to £5.2 million, integration costs relating
to Old English Inns amounted to £2.8 million and the surplus
on property disposals amounted to £1.5 million.
Summary
The strength of our cash flow, the value of our property and
our focus on economic fundamentals has led to a strong and
sustained performance over the last five years. Our financial
momentum has been helped by recent acquisitions. We face
the future with confidence..
Consistent press and television advertising, and strong branding,
delivered record market share and 5 per cent growth for our own
beers during the year. GROUP FINANCIAL RECORD

ACCOUNTING POLICIES 25
Basis of  accounting and consolidation
The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting and financial reporting standards.
They are prepared under the historical cost convention modified by the revaluation of property. The group accounts incorporate the
accounts of the company, its subsidiaries under the acquisition method and its associates under the equity method.
Turnover
Turnover represents the value of goods and services supplied to third parties net of discounts and excluding value added tax.
Revaluation of  properties
Fixed asset properties were revalued in earlier years and the surplus reflected in the balance sheet. With effect from 2 May 1999, and
following the implementation of the FRS 15 accounting standard, revaluations are no longer undertaken. Earlier valuations are retained
but not updated.
Depreciation
Freehold land is not depreciated, freehold buildings are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up to fifty years,
long leasehold properties are depreciated to their estimated residual values over periods up to fifty years, short leasehold properties are
depreciated to their estimated residual values over the remaining term of the lease and furniture, fixtures and equipment assets are
depreciated over their estimated lives which range from three to twenty years.
Where the carrying value of properties may not be recoverable an impairment in the value of fixed assets is charged to the profit and
loss account.
Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value and where applicable include an element of production overheads.
Loan capital
Loan capital and equivalent financial instruments include the premium realised on issue, or recognised on acquisition, which is
amortised over the term of the loan to keep the effective interest rate constant.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not been reversed by the balance sheet date
and is calculated using the tax rates at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is not recognised when an asset is sold if it is more likely
than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over. Provisions for deferred tax are not discounted.
Financial instruments
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised as adjustments to the interest expense over the period of
the swap contracts.
Pensions
The cost of providing defined benefit pensions is charged against profits on a systematic basis taking account of actuarial surpluses and
deficits arising which are allocated over the remaining average service life of current qualifying employees. The cost of providing
defined contribution pensions amounts to the value of contributions made.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising from the premium paid on businesses acquired after 3 May 1998 is amortised over its estimated useful life of 20
years. Previously goodwill was written off to reserves and has not been re-instated.
Operating leases
Rental payments in respect of operating leases are charged against trading profit on a straight line basis over the period of the lease. NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE FIFTY-THREE WEEKS ENDED 4 MAY 2002
26 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
1  CHANGES TO ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The FRS 17 (Retirement Benefits) initial transitional arrangements have been complied with. There have been no changes to the
reported figures. Additional disclosure is set out in note 7 to the accounts.

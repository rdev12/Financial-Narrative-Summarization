 By aligning and consolidating our regional 
design, engineering, sales and distribution 
activities closer to our customers we can 
drive innovation and further improve time to 
market. This simplification of our operating 
model will allow us to focus on key activities 
that support our differentiation strategy, 
and leverage common process and 
operational scale that facilitate our growth.
We have drawn upon our extensive 
experience in setting up in new territories 
and expanding existing facilities to execute 
these changes. The programme is already 
underway which also underlines the progress 
we have made in our culture and leadership. 
As stated when we announced our plans 
in October 2015, we anticipate pre-tax 
cash costs to be up to $60m, to deliver 
this change, a significant investment in the 
Group, much of which will be treated as an 
exceptional cost. We will deliver pre-tax cash 
savings of at least $20m per annum, once 
fully implemented. We will self-fund this 
investment and there will be no impact on 
the dividend or any future acquisition plans.
DIVERSIFYING OUR CAPABILITIES AND 
CAPTURING NEW MARKETS
In November we acquired LSR, a wireless 
product design and development 
technology company based in North 
America, for £35.9m. This was successfully 
integrated into our existing M2M business 
within three months of the acquisition 
and is performing well. This acquisition 
delivers on our strategy of expanding our 
capabilities, products and services. It also 
provides us with new routes to market for 
our existing products meeting our objective 
for customer diversification.
In January 2016 we acquired Novero, 
a leading integrated vehicle connectivity 
systems provider based in Germany, for 
£47.1m. We are in the process of integrating 
Novero into our existing Telematics business. 
This acquisition enhances our offering of 
innovative wireless solutions in one of our 
DELIVERING AGAINST OUR 
GROWTH STRATEGY
When I joined Laird in 2012 we established 
clear strategic objectives in order to 
grow our business. These were focused 
on customer diversification, selective 
acquisitions and strategic differentiation 
through innovation, reliable fulfilment and 
speed. We have executed well against this 
strategy and as a result of this, 2015 has been 
another successful year with revenue up 
12% in sterling and up 5% in US Dollar  
on a constant currency basis. This represents 
an average of 7% organic revenue growth 
per annum for the last three years.
C ONNECTING STRA TEG Y AND  EXECUTION
Laird has made considerable progress in 
leadership development, culture, strategy 
and governance. We now have the clarity 
of strategy and organisational capabilities 
to tackle the last key foundation that 
underpins our business, which is why  
we announced in October that we were 
re-designing our operating model. The plan, 
to simplify our manufacturing capabilities in 
Europe and North America into our largest 
facilities, thus reducing our footprint of 
52 sites to 40 sites globally will reinforce 
our ability to deliver reliable fulfilment and 
speed, while leveraging our cost base.

04 OUTLOOK
We enter 2016 confident in our outlook 
for further growth and in our best position 
for several years. This confidence is 
underpinned by an increasingly well 
diversified mix of technologies, customers 
and end markets. Continued progress 
in Wireless Systems and better markets 
within Performance Materials is countering 
headwinds in other areas. This, coupled with 
full year contributions from the LSR and 
Novero acquisitions and the positive benefits 
of our operational improvements, supports 
our expectations for the year as a whole. 
We anticipate a progressive improvement 
in our performance during the year, with a 
steady first half performance and growth 
weighted towards the second half.

core and fastest-growing markets, the 
connected car. We are now one of the leading 
global providers of end-to-end connectivity 
services both into and within the vehicle.
Both LSR and Novero meet our strategy 
by expanding our capabilities in wireless 
connectivity, and most importantly, both 
extend our reach, presence and capabilities 
in the Enterprise Internet of Things (EIoT) 
markets within the Connected Industrial  
and Connected Transport sectors.
As well as expanding our scope through 
acquisitions, we opened a new site in Brazil 
to support our expansion in South America – 
a site which is now operational and, under 
our new operating model, will serve a 
number of our businesses.
MARKETS
We have performed well across our five 
markets in 2015, capturing further market 
share in both Connected Transport and 
Mobile Devices and continuing to make 
progress with customers in Connected 
Medical. At the end of the year our business 
was well balanced with the majority of our 
revenue split across Connected Transport 
(28%), Telecom/Computing (28%) and 
Mobile Devices (21%). Connected Industry 
and Connected Medical are still relatively 
small in terms of revenue (14% in total) but 
these are newer markets for us and both 
have significant scope for growth.
CULTURE
Laird has undergone a cultural transformation 
over the past three years and ‘One Laird’  
is now a strongly embedded ethos within 
the entire organisation. This culture not only 
fosters the exchange of ideas and innovation 
that can lead to new product development 
and customer wins but it also fosters 
collaboration across functions and teams 
which means all employees have a sense of 
ownership. Our all employee share scheme 
saw take-up of more than double the 
expected levels on launch which is testament 
to their commitment to the business.

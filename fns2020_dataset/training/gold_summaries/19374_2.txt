Improvement in operational efficiencies
+9.0% 
Management continue to focus on improving operational efficiencies.  
The Tern Hill pack site was closed in August 2014 and sold in January  
2015 for £2m. Investments in new technology at our remaining packing  
sites helped facilitate this capacity rationalisation. As a result, one of  
our key operational measures, man hours per tonne improved by 9%  
for the second half year, following the final reallocation of volumes  
between sites post the busy Christmas peak.
Continued growth for Restrain
+10.5 %
Sales continue to increase through Restrain, our ethylene storage  
and ripening solution business. The expansion into new markets  
and new products helped increase turnover by over 10.5 % with  
gross margin increasing by a similar percentage when compared  
to prior year.
Increase in daffodil sales 
+7 .4 %
Another very good season for daffodil sales from Rowe Farming  
resulted in an increase in volume of over 7.4% , with total turnover  
up 4.6 % , compared to prior year.

 The Group has made further good
progress during 2013, delivering results
in line with the Board’s expectations
for the year.
This performance reflects the benefits
of our strategic decisions to deploy
capital in those markets that offer
superior growth opportunities,
amplifying our geographic diversity,
and to implement a three year plan
to improve operational efficiency.
As a result we have mitigated both the
impact of the continued economic
headwinds in Europe during the year
and the unusual severity of the winter
months at the start of 2013. With
revenues marginally ahead over the
year, our margins were stable and our
interest charge reduced, improving our
profitability and driving strong growth
in earnings.
As planned, a substantial investment
programme was undertaken during the
year, predominantly directed at expanding
our businesses in France and the Middle
East to meet growing demand and at the
continued refreshment of our European
rental fleet to support our strong market
positions. This investment was fully funded
from our annual cash flows and illustrates
the strong cash generation capabilities
and robust capital structure that the
Group has developed.
As previously reported, our return on
capital employed (“ROCE”) showed a
marginal 10bps decline in the year,
principally due to a weaker than expected
trading performance from our UK
business. We have taken steps to address
this within the UK, strengthening the
organisational structure and management
team, and we are pleased to see these
measures starting to deliver the required
performance improvement. We remain
confident that the Group’s ROCE can be
further improved, in order to meet our
strategic target of being above its pre-tax
weighted average cost of capital of 11%
across the business cycle.
Over the past three years, the Group’s
capabilities have been significantly
enhanced through successfully

capital efficiency programmes. Whilst we
will continue to seek greater efficiency
within our business and are targeting
further operational improvements, our
strategic focus is now on the delivery of
revenue growth in our key markets. We are
confident that growth in revenues derived
from our strong market positions and
differentiated services, when combined
with our improved operational leverage
and self-funded investment, will deliver
substantial shareholder value over the
medium term.
Return on capital employed
The Group’s ROCE was 10.6% for the year
(2012: 10.7%). The calculation of ROCE is
based on the Group’s operating profit
before exceptional items for 2013 and the
average of the opening and closing capital
employed for the year of £300.8 million
(2012: £292.5 million).
Dividend
Given the continued improvement in the
Group’s financial performance and strong
cash flows, the Board is proposing a final
dividend of 2.40 pence per share, making
a total dividend for the year of 3.55 pence;
an increase of 29% over the previous
year (2012: total dividend of 2.75 pence).
The final dividend, if approved, will be
paid on 30 April 2014 to shareholders
on the register at the close of business
on 7 March 2014.
The proposed increase in the dividend for
the year again reflects the Board’s
confidence in the Group’s future and the
continued recognition that dividends are an
important means of delivering shareholder
value. Dividend cover, based on the
proposed total dividend for 2013 and
underlying earnings per share, has been
reduced to 4.0 times (2012: 4.7 times) in
line with our previously stated intention to
increase dividend distributions to a level
that is covered by three to four times by
earnings. Our dividend cover will be
balanced against the Group’s investment
needs and funding requirements as we
move through the business cycle.

Overview Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements Operational and capital
efficiency programmes
Our three year programme to improve the
Group’s operational and capital efficiency
has been successfully concluded, delivering
an annualised benefit ahead of our
expectations of £5.2 million by the end of
2013. These gains were secured through
the combination of better asset utilisation
and pricing, more efficient transport, sales
resource realignment and improved
procurement of goods and services.
An additional phase of operational
improvements has been scoped and a
target of an annualised £1.5 million has
been set to be delivered by the end of
2016. It is expected that these savings will
be primarily derived through further
efficiency from within our transport network
and procurement activity. The delivery of
these benefits will be managed through
our cycle of continuous improvement,
as we seek greater operational leverage
within our business model.
The effective deployment of capital remains
central to the Group’s strategy to improve
ROCE, strengthening market positions and
supporting growth opportunities where
incremental returns are attractive. During
the year additional capital was deployed in
France and the Middle East, as fleets were
expanded to meet growing demand, and we
expect to invest further in these businesses
in 2014. Utilisation of the Group’s existing
fleet capacity was again improved during the
year, reflecting better process management
and increased availability through more
efficient maintenance programmes. The
Group’s new IT platform now covers almost
85% of the Group’s revenues and, with the
initial teething issues in Germany now fully
resolved, is providing an enhanced capability
to drive asset utilisation and returns through
improved visibility and functionality.
The ability to improve returns from our
existing fleet, before allocating additional
capital, is an important factor that can
augment our financial returns as market
conditions improve.
Financial results
The Group’s total revenue for the year
increased by 1% to £237.5 million (2012:
£234.6 million), with rental revenues
increasing by 2% to £225.3 million (2012:
£220.7 million) and revenues from the sale
of new and ex-rental fleet equipment
declining by £1.7 million.
Underlying operating profits increased by
1% to £35.3 million (2012: £35.0 million),
while operating margins were stable at
14.9%. With underlying net interest costs
reducing to £5.3 million during the year
(2012: £7.4 million), the Group’s
underlying profit before tax increased by
9% to £30.0 million (2012: £27.6 million).
This increase in profitability, combined
with a reduced effective tax rate of 20%
(2012: 23%), generated an underlying
profit after tax of £24.1 million (2012:
£21.2 million) and a 12% increase in
underlying earnings per share to
14.42 pence (2012: 12.83 pence).
Amortisation charges in the year reduced
to £3.3 million (2012: £3.8 million), and an
exceptional charge of £3.3 million was
incurred (2012: £3.6 million) relating
principally to the completion of the
restructuring exercise within our German
business. After amortisation charges and
exceptional items, the Group’s operating
profit was £28.7 million (2012: £29.7
million). The Group’s profit before tax was
£23.4 million (2012: £20.8 million) and the
Group’s profit after tax was £19.1 million
(2012: £16.2 million), with earnings per
share of 11.41 pence (2012: 9.80 pence).
Using exchange rates consistent with
2012, the Group’s total revenues for the
year declined by 1% to £233.2 million
(2012: £234.6 million), with underlying
operating profits at £34.7 million (2012:
£35.0 million). Underlying profit before tax
increased to £29.4 million (2012: £27.6
million), while underlying profit after tax
increased to £23.7 million (2012: £21.2
million), with underlying earnings per
share increasing to 14.16 pence
(2012: 12.83 pence).
Cash flow
Underlying earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”)
increased to £76.2 million (2012: £75.6
million), with margins stable at 32.1%
(2012: 32.2%). Although the Group’s fleet
investment programme in the year
increased the net cash outflow relating to
the purchase and sale of rental fleet assets
to £39.9 million (2012: £25.4 million), the
Group still generated a healthy £25.5 million
from operations (2012: £39.7 million). Net
cash generated from operating activities,
after payment of interest and tax, was
£12.3 million (2012: £21.2 million).
Investment
As planned, the Group increased its level of
capital expenditure for 2013 with a total of
£55.1 million invested in the Group’s rental
fleet and operational infrastructure (2012:
£47.9 million). This was partly funded by
the disposal of surplus or retired assets
which generated £10.5 million (2012:
£11.1 million). After reflecting movements
in amounts owing to equipment suppliers
at the beginning and end of the year, this
activity resulted in a net cash outflow
relating to capital expenditure of £44.9
million (2012: £29.8 million), which was fully
funded from annual operating cash flows.
In 2014, it is planned to undertake an
investment programme of similar size to
2013, again funded through annual
operating cash flows.
The investment programme undertaken in
the year has replaced approximately 7%
of the Group’s rental fleet, expanded the
French and Middle East fleets to meet
growing demand, increased the availability
of our BlueSky range of machine
attachments and improved our operational
infrastructure. The overall impact of our
fleet investment and disposal programme
has been a net increase in the Group’s total
fleet size of around 700 units to 20,600
machines by the year end, and a reduction
in the average age of our fleet to 7.1 years
(2012: 7.3 years).
Net debt
The strength of the Group’s operating cash
flows absorbed the planned increase in the
capital expenditure programme for 2013,
and consequently, despite an adverse
foreign exchange movement of £1.6 million,
the Group’s net debt at the year end of
£97.7 million remained broadly in line with
the £97.3 million at the end of 2012.

Private Placement, the Group’s reported
net debt at 31 December 2013 was
£97.0 million (2012: £96.5 million).
The corresponding debt to equity ratio
improved to 46% (2012: 49%), and the net
debt to pre-exceptional EBITDA ratio
(calculated on a rolling 12 month basis)
reduced marginally to 1.27 times (2012:
1.28 times). The Group is operating well
within its banking covenants and has
significant liquidity available from its
combined financing facilities.
Board changes
As the Group moves into the next stage of
its development, the Board have recognised
the need to refresh its composition and add
a wider breadth of skills and experience.
Consequently with effect from 1 March 2014,
we have appointed John Coghlan and
John Wyatt as Non Executive Directors. 
Jan Åstrand, who has been a Non-Executive
Director of the Group since 2010, has
resigned from the Board with effect of
26 February 2014. I would like to take this
opportunity to thank Jan for his advice and
contribution to the Board over the past
three years. Andrew Wood will replace Jan
as the Group’s Senior Independent Director
and John Coghlan will become Chairman of
the Group’s Remuneration Committee.
Summary and outlook
During 2013, the Group’s profitability
continued to improve as strong revenue
growth from our French and Middle East
businesses was combined with the
successful completion of our three year
efficiency improvement programme. The
restructuring exercise in our German
business has been completed, and action
has been taken to address a relatively
disappointing performance from our UK
business in the year; the benefits of these
measures are beginning to be seen.
The strength of the Group’s cash flows
fully funded a substantial investment
programme in the year, supporting the
expansion of our French and Middle East
businesses while at the same time enabling
our extensive refreshment plans for our
European fleet to continue apace.
This ability to internally fund our annual
fleet replacement requirements while
supporting growth opportunities with
investment, is a key attribute of the Group
going forward as we seek ever greater
returns from our deployed capital base.
The Board believes that the necessary
measures are in place to enable ROCE, our
key performance metric, to be increased
above the Group’s weighted average cost
of capital over the business cycle. The
efficiency gains secured over the past three
years are embedded within our business
model, and the improved operating
leverage that these provide will be further
enhanced by the additional operational
improvements now being targeted. The
momentum that has been created within
the business to date, through our efficiency
and selective expansion programmes, is yet
to benefit appreciably from any cyclical
recovery in our European markets. As we
move into 2014, with the first signs of
improving market conditions emerging in
the UK and a more efficient business model
established, we are well positioned to drive
revenue growth within our business and
deliver increased profitability.
Trading since the year end is in line with our
expectations and has not been disrupted by
a prolonged period of adverse weather to
date. The Board believes the Group is well
positioned to deliver continued financial
progress this year and substantial
shareholder value over the medium term.

Past Year’s Highlights
The year’s highlight was our successful initial public 
offering on the London Stock Exchange Alternative 
Investment Market in September. The cash raised by 
the IPO has helped support growth in the business 
and fund designs of our own exclusive devices. During 
2005 i-mate brought to market the world’s ﬁ rst 3G 
Microsoft® Windows Mobile™ phone (JasJar), as well as 
the ﬁ rst Windows Mobile™ 5.0 Smartphones with Wi-Fi 
capabilities (SP5 & SP5m).     This is in addition to three new 
versions of the Jam and our ﬁ rst GPS satellite device. Our 
website has seen club i-mate™ user base increase 250% 
to 420,000.  Our software operations based in Armenia has grown its library of games by 200% to 32, including 6 
play-in, play-out interactive games.  We expanded our ofﬁ ces in Dubai, Seattle, and Australia, and established an 
operation in India. 
Product & Software Roadmap
New manufacturing partners have been signed up and a road map of products agreed for the next two years 
covering up to some 30 products, the majority of which will be exclusive to i-mate. We will also reveal our own 
exclusive products at 3GSM Congress in Barcelona next February. These products will be our ﬁ rst completely 
designed and manufactured products and we believe they will be the next step in mobile phone computing, 
having been designed around our software strategy 
and to blend with Microsoft’s larger strategy. i-mate’s 
software development team, based out of Redmond, 
Washington, spent the past year completing 
version 1 of i-mate™ Suite.  This is a complete solution
for business-wide management, providing command 
and control, security of mobile data and data 
backup capabilities. Comprising three separate 
modules – i-mate™ Control,  i-mate™ Backup and 
i-mate™ 1-View, the software offers true mobile 
functionality without losing control of security or 
compromising data. i-mate™ 1-View safely extends 
access to corporate networks and ﬁ les to Microsoft® 
Windows Mobile™ devices, expands mobile device 
storage, and provides document, data, and ﬁ le sharing. i-mate™ Control allows enterprises to safeguard sensitive 
data, remotely conﬁ gure or troubleshoot devices, automatically update all devices in the ﬁ eld and remotely 
customise devices, while i-mate™ Backup provides full remote wireless data backup, the capability to   deﬁ ne backup 
policies and schedules,   and restore Windows Mobile™ devices.   Financial Highlights
i-mate has had a year of signiﬁ cant progress in 2005. Our revenues, product lines, and geographic territories 
expanded, while at the same time we managed to contain expense growth.  Revenues grew at 51%. Territorial 
expansion for hardware sales has continued in 2006.   Revenues have been rapidly expanding around the globe 
with European growth over 100% this year, overtaking the Middle East as the largest revenue generating region 
and providing 36% of overall revenue.  Even achieving this growth, gross margins were 24%. U.S. sales were much 
slower than expected due to the lack of availability of appropriate products. Overall this has led to proﬁ t before 
taxation rising by $8.1m to $22.5m, an increase of 56%. The overall effective rate of tax during the year was 4.2% 
compared with 3.8% during the previous ﬁ nancial year. 
Strategy
 i-mate’s strategy is simple: 
�  we are developing our own unique, exclusive products; 
�  we will continue to develop software which differentiates our products and which 
 demonstrates the diverse usability and value of our products; 
�  we will continue to provide exceptional customer service; and
�  we will continue to expand our sales territories, raise the value and proﬁ le of our 
 brand and partner deeper and closer with Microsoft in all territories.

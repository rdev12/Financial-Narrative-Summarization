 2007 has seen AMS continue to make
excellent progress in building a leading,
global woundcare technology company.
The financial position has continued to
strengthen, new products have been
launched and partners have been added
in key markets. Both segments of the
business — advanced woundcare and
wound closure and sealants — have
performed well in 2007 giving the Group
a broad base of products and routes to
market to deliver future growth.
Advanced Woundcare
AMS provides a comprehensive range of
advanced woundcare products that
pioneer the concept of moist wound
healing. This allows wounds to heal faster
and with less pain and scarring compared
with traditional wound dressings. The
products protect the wound, deal with
tissue fluids and provide an optimal
healing environment. 
In the case of routine wounds or where
cost management is key, AMS provides
wound dressings direct to the NHS in the
UK under its own ActivHeal® brand or
through private label distribution partners
in other markets.
The Company made good progress in
2007 with its direct ActivHeal® offering
by broadening its product range and
gaining new Hospital and Primary Care
Trusts. A key addition was University
College London Hospital (UCLH) NHS
Foundation Trust which adopted products
from the ActivHeal® range in August
2007 as a first line therapy for routine
wounds. Granted Foundation Trust status
in 2004 and comprising seven separate
hospital sites, UCLH NHS Trust is a major
London teaching centre and contracts
with 300 Primary Care Trusts. The
training and educational assistance
provided by the AMS clinical nurse team
to support successful conversion was well
received. This is particularly encouraging
as over the past year the Group has
focused on providing strong clinical
support to back up the value proposition
of its product offering.
As well as cost management, and training
and educational support, the users of
advanced woundcare products seek
technological innovation and AMS has
also delivered a number of new products
during the period. New improved foam
and hydrocolloid dressings were launched
in June and ActivHeal Aquafiber® was
launched at the Wounds UK 2007
Conference in Harrogate, North Yorkshire
in November.
ActivHeal Aquafiber® is a soft,
conformable and highly absorbent
dressing. In contact with wound exudate,
the product forms a soft, clear gel
providing an ideal moist wound
environment that supports the wound
healing process. Indicated for moderate
to heavily exuding chronic and acute
wounds, ActivHeal Aquafiber® also
controls minor bleeding in superficial
wounds. ActivHeal Aquafiber® competes
in a segment of the advanced woundcare
market on which it is estimated that the
NHS currently spends £15 million each
year. In a scientific poster presented at 
the Harrogate conference, ActivHeal
Aquafiber® was shown to be equivalent
to or better than a significantly more
expensive leading brand on all five
performance characteristics tested
including absorbency, speed of
absorbency, dry strength, wet strength
and lateral wicking — all key attributes of
a moist wound healing dressing.

Aquafiber® is a soft, conformable, highly absorbent dressing. In contact
with wound exudate Aquafiber® converts to a soft, clear gel providing an
ideal moist wound environment that supports the wound healing process.
Aquafiber® is indicated for moderately to heavily exuding 
wounds and to control minor bleeding in superficial wounds.
Aquafiber® is designed to remain intact when wet or dry making it easy and atraumatic
when removing from the wound.
Aquafiber® contains calcium ions that
exchange with sodium ions found in
wound fluid. Calcium is known to be
beneficial in several stages of the
wound healing process.

an average price 30% lower than the
equivalent branded dressing, thus
offering a significant immediate saving on
NHS woundcare budgets.
In the case of infected or problematic
wounds, AMS provides its new
technologies such as silver dressings
through strategic partnerships with major
players who have the marketing presence
and global reach to rapidly commercialise
new concepts. The Group continued to
make good progress with its silver
alginate business and is looking to
broaden its offering to include new anti-
microbial technologies and delivery
systems. The opportunity to access the
US burns market was strengthened with
510(k) clearance being granted by the
FDA, allowing AMS to extend its claims
for a silver alginate dressing that is
effective for up to 21 days. This allows
the frequency of dressing changes to be
reduced, thus providing a significant
reduction in the time and overall cost of
treatment, a better opportunity for
healing to progress undisturbed and less
pain and discomfort to the patient. The
extended claims strengthen the
commercial offering to marketing partners
looking to access the burns market. 
Wound closure and sealants
The wound closure and sealants product
portfolio has been strengthened by the
introduction of new products in key
markets.
LiquiBand™ EZ Squeeze is an addition to
the LiquiBand® wound closure range sold
throughout Europe. This development is
part of a continual process to make tissue
adhesives easier to use. Simple, safe and
precise application is equally important
to the adhesive properties in gaining user
acceptance of cyanoacrylate tissue
adhesives for closure of small cuts and
trauma wounds through to large surgical
incisions. Accreditation of the Company’s
Educational Programme for minor wound
closure by the Royal College of Nursing
Accreditation Unit is also helping to gain
user acceptance in the UK.
Simple innovations such as the EZ
Squeeze product and strong educational
support to clinical users have helped
AMS maintain its leadership position in
the UK A & E market and continue to
penetrate other EU markets through its
distributor base.
Obtaining approval of the LiquiBand™
wound closure range for the US market
by the FDA remains a major focus for the
business. It is currently anticipated that
topical tissue adhesives will be
reclassified to a 510(k) approval route
during 2008 allowing subsequent entry
into this major market. A marketing and
distribution partner has been identified
for the US and market entry plans are
being drawn up subject to regulatory
approval. In parallel with the 510(k)
reclassification route, multi-centre
clinical studies are being conducted to
support the existing PMA route if
necessary.
As well as being an ideal wound closure
material, the AMS cyanoacrylate
technology offers exciting applications for
sealing and protecting skin. LiquiShield®
S (Superskin®) is a barrier film that is
indicated for helping to prevent skin
breakdown which can lead to bed sores
particularly in patients in long term care
facilities. This product is available in
Europe and US markets, sold through
distributors who are focused on the
nursing home sector.
Surgical skin sealant is an innovative
product designed to help prevent
infection of surgical sites due to the
patients’ skin flora. This product was
licensed to Kimberly-Clark Health Care in
2006 as a global exclusive and was
launched under their InteguSeal® brand
into the US in February 2007. The
product, which is now available in the
US, Europe and other international
markets, is being evaluated in a wide
range of surgical procedures with positive
initial reactions by surgeons and
institutions. It is estimated that the cost
of hospital acquired infection was $3
billion in the US in 2007, with surgical
site infections (SSI) a major component.
This is resulting in considerable interest
being taken in products that can reduce
the incidence of SSI, particularly when
reimbursement of the cost of these is
under question.

Skin sealant designed to reduce the
risk of skin flora contamination of a
surgical wound.
Contamination by the patient’s own skin
flora is recognized as a major factor in the
development of surgical site infection
during surgical procedures. Compared with
uninfected patients, those with surgical site
infections have been shown to remain in
hospital seven days longer, are 60% more
likely to be re-admitted to intensive care
units, are five times more likely to return for
treatment within 30 days of discharge and
have double the mortality rate.

InteguSeal* Microbial Sealant consists of a
liquid adhesive film applied to the skin
surface using a novel applicator prior to
surgery. Skin flora are immobilised during
the time of the surgery thus reducing the
potential for contamination of the 
surgical site.

Wound management products range from
traditional gauzes and adhesive plasters to
the advanced moist woundcare dressings as
currently sold by AMS. The use of medical
adhesives as a barrier for the protection of
skin is a relatively new concept.
LiquiShield® S is a topical, liquid barrier
film that is painted onto the skin in a very
thin layer in order to provide protection
against skin damage caused by friction,
shear and/or the presence of moisture. 
LiquiShield® S (Formerly SuperSkin®)
received FDA clearance for sale in the USA
in December 1997 and a CE mark for sales
into Europe in April 1998. While it was
renamed LiquiShield® S for the USA
market, it continues to be sold under the
name of SuperSkin® in the UK.
LiquiShield® S is sold through distributors
into both markets, targeted mainly at the
nursing home sector. There are few
competitors within the liquid barrier market
and the formulation of the LiquiShield® S
product provides some significant
competitive advantages.
Friction, shear or the presence of moisture
can lead to skin breakdown, particularly in
radiation patients, amputees utilising
prosthetic limbs, stoma patients, bedridden
patients, paraplegics, quadriplegics and
individuals with generally compromised
skin integrity. LiquiShield® S has
applications in each of these areas.

The Group’s strengthening financial
position is allowing it to actively review
investment opportunities to deliver future
growth:

Research and Development
AMS built on its development
activities during 2007 and continues
to provide a strong new product
pipeline for its organic business
based on a broad patent portfolio. In
addition, a number of new technology
platforms are being researched.
In advanced woundcare, the focus
remains on the incorporation of
ingredients into the base material
technologies, that actively help
accelerate the wound healing process.
The initial approach is to deal with
infection, which delays wound
healing, hence AMS’ active
programme in the inclusion of anti-
microbials such as silver, into its
dressings. Whilst the current activity
is centred on silver alginate,
opportunities exist to broaden this
into other products, and appropriate
developments and regulatory
approvals are under way. 
An area that is attracting considerable
interest in the research community is
the role of metallo-matrix proteases
(MMPs), enzymes produced by the
body in response to a wound, that
subsequently inhibit or delay healing.
A number of technologies that
modulate MMPs are being reviewed
as candidates for inclusion in AMS
products as part of the next
generation wound dressings.
A number of avenues continue to be
progressed to enter the internal
adhesives and sealant market. This
involves leveraging the Group’s
current cyanoacrylate technology
platform or licensing or acquiring new
materials and exploiting existing
expertise in adhesive development,
applicator design and regulatory
approval.

Manufacturing operations
2007 saw a strong performance from
the company’s manufacturing
operations delivering significant
volume growth whilst ramping up
production to support major product
launches in silver alginate and
surgical skin sealants. This was
achieved within tight management of
working capital whilst maintaining
quality and service levels. The Group
is planning to rationalise its two
manufacturing operations in
Winsford, Cheshire into a new single
site in the local area supported by
selective strategic outsourcing. This
will create substantial additional
capacity for future growth of the
business and deliver operational
efficiencies over the current set-up. A
capital investment of £4 million has
been identified during 2009 for
setting up the new facility which is
expected to come on stream in early
2010. An experienced project
manager has been recruited who is
dedicated to overseeing this major
project, reporting to the Executive
Board.
Summary
The Group continued to make excellent
progress during 2007 in strengthening its
financial position and advancing the key
drivers of its multi-faceted growth
strategy.
As a technology rich, profitable, cash
generative business in the medical device
sector, with a dedicated and focused
workforce, AMS is well placed to continue
to create value for shareholders.

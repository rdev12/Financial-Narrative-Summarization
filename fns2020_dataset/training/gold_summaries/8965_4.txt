What does K3 do?
K3 is one of the UK’s leading providers of integrated business solutions to 
the supply chain sector. Our customers are Retailers, Manufacturers and 
Distributors who are looking for global, brand leading business solutions 
from a specialist provider who is dedicated to their market sector.
We support 3,128 customers from five regional 
centres in the UK, with our international operations 
headquartered in Holland.
Increasingly our customers are considering Cloud 
Computing, to defray IT costs and to provide a more 
flexible and secure IT infrastructure that will deliver 
them a competitive edge.
We take market leading solutions from Microsoft, 
Sage and SYSPRO and add our own Intellectual 
Property (“IP”) to create industry specific solutions.
By having our own IP , we can tailor these solutions 
to our core markets and our solutions are thus more 
competitive, creating more loyal customers, whilst at 
the same time driving up margins.
We have loyal customers and once installed, our 
software systems can remain in place for 15 years 
or longer. This ensures that K3 generates very high 
levels of recurring income.
K3 has a strong and successful track record of 
growth. We have steadily grown organically and 
through acquisition over the last 10 years and will 
continue with this dual growth strategy.

Our markets
Retail
K3 entered the retail market in 2004 
with a key acquisition. This business 
unit has grown significantly since 
then and now has over £20m of sales 
annually. Our customers tend to be 
well known ‘high street’ retailers 
which select K3 because of our 
sector knowledge, track record and 
innovative solutions. In recent times, 
high street retailers have been under 
pressure but K3 has continued to 
grow thanks to a strategic investment 
in multi-channel retail (including 
internet, store and mail order) in 
2008/9 and, despite the economic 
downturn, K3 continues to win major 
new contracts year on year.
Manufacturing
With over 1,000 manufacturing 
customers, K3 is the largest provider 
of integrated business solutions 
to the manufacturing sector. We 
offer solutions for both ‘discrete’ 
and ‘process’ manufacturers, and 
our customers range from global 
multi-nationals running K3 solutions 
worldwide to small engineering 
companies.
Distribution
Distribution is the most recent 
area of K3’s expansion, with several 
acquisitions creating a dedicated 
business unit of size and scale. Whilst 
there is considerable overlap with our 
retail and manufacturing customers, 
we now have some 700 dedicated 
distribution customers relying on K3 
for their IT services and support.
International
One of the fastest growing 
parts of K3 is our International 
Operations Division based in The 
Hague. From here we support our 
international retail and distribution 
customers, with some major global 
corporate customers such as Inter 
IKEA Systems BV, the owner and 
franchisor of the IKEA concept. Our 
Pebblestone fashion distribution 
solution is managed from here, 
supporting a network of 30 
distributors in 20 countries.
Hosting and 
Managed Services
From data centres in Edinburgh, 
London and New York we support 
a global hosting and managed 
service business that looks after the 
IT infrastructures for K3 customers 
around the globe, both on-premise 
and hosted. Cloud Computing is a 
fast growing sector for industry as 
a whole and this is also one of K3’s 
fastest growing business units.

 I am delighted to write to you following 
another successful year at DMGT. The 
results we have delivered are a testament 
to the quality of our assets, the creativity 
of our workforce and the entrepreneurial 
approach of our management team. 
DMGT remains at the forefront of the 
international business-to-business (B2B) 
and consumer media sectors. We have a 
diverse asset portfolio which has delivered 
a strong underlying performance and total 
shareholder returns (as shown in the charts 
on page 03).
On behalf of the Board and as the largest 
shareholder in DMGT, I would like to thank 
Martin Morgan and his management 
team for continuing to expand our B2B 
companies and develop our consumer 
media presence.
The management strategy, fully endorsed 
by the Board, is focused on building a 
global growth company in the media and 
B2B markets we serve. DMGT’s operating 
margin has improved from 13% in 2009 to 
17% in 2014. This is due to the combination 
of the improving consumer margin and the 
increased proportion of the business that is 
B2B (as shown in the charts on page 03).
In the financial year covered by this report, 
this strategy helped deliver organic growth 
and returns on our recent investments. 
As a result, adjusted earnings per share rose 
by 12% to 55.7 pence. DMGT generated 
healthy cash flow, and the Board is 
recommending a 7% increase in the final 
dividend per share for 2014.
At the operating level, the benefits of 
our global footprint, entrepreneurialism 
and creativity were evident across 
our businesses. 
In consumer media, the Mail titles 
consolidated their position as pioneers 
of quality popular journalism. MailOnline 
continued to win new global audiences, 
whilst increasing its editorial coordination 
with Daily Mail and The Mail on Sunday. 
Advertising revenues have remained solid 
and our print titles have gained market 
share despite the challenges faced by 
traditional print media.
Among our B2B assets, RMS maintained 
its leading position for catastrophe risk 
modelling. We took the decision to delay 
the deployment of RMS(one) during the 
year, which reflected a determination to 
roll out this technology only when it fully 
meets clients’ expectations. Your Board 
regrets the impact the delay in the launch 
of RMS(one) has had on us, as shareholders, 
and the executive team is working hard to 
support RMS to deliver on its revised plan.
We saw further expansion in our 
information businesses. The acquisition of 
Decision Insight Information Group (DIIG), 
a leading property search group in the UK 
and Ireland, reflects our ability to make 
acquisitions that will deliver further growth. 
At dmg events, we successfully increased 
the frequency and geographic presence 
of flagship events which have continued 
to be the must-attend exhibitions and 
networking opportunities for their 
respective communities. 
Meanwhile, Euromoney is improving its 
digital capabilities through the launch of 
its Delphi content management system. 
The project will enhance coordination 
and the use of technology across the 
Euromoney portfolio.
During the financial year, DMGT unlocked 
significant value from the sale of Evenbase 
and through the IPO of Zoopla Property 
Group Plc, in which we remain a supportive 
and engaged financial investor. We also 
made a number of acquisitions to 
strengthen our B2B information capabilities. 
The twin approach of organic investment 
and bolt-on acquisitions has continued to 
diversify the Group by business area 
and geography.
DMGT will continue to pursue international 
expansion in high-growth markets. In the 
period covered by this Annual Report, 
I witnessed those growth opportunities 
at first hand with a visit to our businesses 
in Asia. I was delighted to see how well 
dmg information has established itself, with 
its hub office in Singapore. Our expansion 
continues in other geographies, with 
Euromoney acquiring Mining Indaba, 
an investment forum in South Africa, 
whilst dmg events has expanded its 
overseas businesses to include Mexico 
and Morocco.
The implementation of our Group strategy 
is overseen by the Board, which continues 
to maintain high standards of governance. 
The Governance Report (pages 40 to 50) 
sets out the framework for operating 
performance and shareholder value that is 
central to the growth of DMGT. The strategy 
is overseen by a Board of Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors with relevant skills 
and experience. The Board’s commitment 
to diversity is explained in the Corporate 
Governance section of this report.

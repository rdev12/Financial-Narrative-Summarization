 Throughout this document, growth/decline rates and margins are stated on a like-for-like basis, unless otherwise indicated. Like-for-like changes in revenue and costs and 
like-for-like margins are calculated after adjusting for movements in foreign exchange in GLS’ revenue and costs, and working days in UKPIL revenue. For volumes, like-for-like 
movements are adjusted for working days in UKPIL.

Revenue and volume
• Group revenue increased by two per cent, 
due to parcel revenue growth in both UKPIL 
and GLS. Parcels are the largest contributor 
to Group revenue, accounting for 
51 per cent.
• UKPIL revenue was £7,787 million, up two 
per cent. UKPIL parcel revenue increased 
by seven per cent. As expected, parcel 
volumes (1,068 million items) were flat 
compared with 2012-13.
• UKPIL letter revenue (including marketing 
mail) declined to £4,625 million, a two per 
cent reduction. The four per cent decline in 
addressed letter volumes for the full year 
was at the better end of our forecast range 
of four to six per cent per annum. Marketing 
mail revenue, part of letter revenue, was 
£1,111 million.
• GLS revenue was £1,651 million, up seven 
per cent. Volumes increased six per cent, 
with growth in both domestic and 
international volumes.
Profit and margins 
• Group operating profit before transformation 
costs grew to £671 million.
• Transformation costs of £241 million for 
the year include a provision of £104 million 
in relation to the management reorganisation 
programme, announced on 25 March 2014, 
which will be implemented in 2014-15.
• Group operating profit after transformation 
costs increased to £430 million. The 
operating profit margin reduced from 
4.4 per cent to 4.2 per cent, as a result  
of the provision for the management 
reorganisation programme.
• UKPIL generated operating profit after 
transformation costs of £309 million. The 
operating profit margin decreased from 
3.9 per cent to 3.5 per cent, again as a 
result of the provision for the management 
reorganisation programme.
• GLS operating profit was £108 million. 
The operating profit margin decreased 
from 6.7 per cent to 6.5 per cent due to 
the full year effect of further increases 
in sub-contractor rates in Germany.

Royal Mail plc 
Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 March 2014 2 
 As the Universal Service provider, Royal Mail is required to provide access at Inward Mail Centres for final mile deliveries.
3 
 The reported business is a subset of UKPIL including network access, and excluding Parcelforce Worldwide and the Royal Mail Property unit. The reported business, as defined by 
Ofcom, is the entity which provides the Universal Service and takes account of all the costs of both the regulated and unregulated products that depend on the core Universal 
Service activities.
• Profit before taxation (excluding specific 
items) of £363 million reflects the trading 
performance of the Group. Accounting 
standards require us to include a one-time, 
non-cash benefit of £1,350 million as a 
result of the Pensions Reform in reported 
profit before taxation and reported notional 
earnings per share.
Notional earnings per share (EPS)
• Notional EPS excluding specific items was 
26.3 pence.
Cash flow and balance sheet
• EBITDA before transformation costs 
grew to £942 million, due to improved 
trading performance. 
• Net cash investment of £581 million 
represents £617 million investment after 
cash from asset disposals of £36 million. 
• Free cash flow increased to £398 million. 
This has driven a reduction in net debt to 
£555 million. 
Dividends
• As previously indicated, the Board has 
recommended a final dividend of 13.3 pence 
per share, subject to shareholder approval at 
the Annual General Meeting, to be held on 
24 July 2014. 
Transformation and cost control
Collections, processing and delivery 
productivity improved by 1.7 per cent (2013 
1.7 per cent) as we reduced the number of 
frontline hours at a faster rate than the 
reduction in the level of workload. 
 See KPIs pages 18 to 19
• Eight Mail Centres closed this financial year, 
taking the total number of Mail Centres 
remaining to 40. We have completed or 
commenced modernisation in 94 per cent 
of our Delivery Offices.
• Tight cost control meant non-people costs 
in UKPIL reduced by three per cent.
Regulation
• The Ofcom investigation into changes 
to access
2
 pricing puts this commercial 
response to changing market conditions 
on hold.
• Based on our estimates of the impact of 
TNT Post UK’s publicly-stated plans, direct 
delivery could reduce Royal Mail revenue by 
over £200 million in 2017-18. See pages 9 
to 11 for more information.
• With our proposed access price changes 
suspended and unfettered direct delivery 
rollout, there is a reasonable prospect that 
Ofcom’s indicative EBIT margin range of 
between five and ten per cent for Royal 
Mail’s reported business
3
 may never 
sustainably be achieved.
• We are preparing a regulatory submission 
calling on Ofcom to take action now and 
carry out a full review of direct delivery. 
Summary outlook 
• We are facing increasing challenges in the 
parcels and letters markets in the UK. 
However, our key value drivers of single 
digit revenue growth, margin expansion and 
underlying free cash flow growth remain 
the objectives for the Group for 2014-15.
• The Board’s intention remains to pursue a 
progressive dividend policy, having regard 
to the normalised earnings progression of 
the Group.

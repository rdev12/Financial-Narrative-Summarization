Earnings and operating profit numbers are stated, throughout the commentary, before exceptional items and certain re-measurements where applicable – see note 2 for definitions.
The Directors believe this measure assists with a better understanding of the underlying performance of the Group. The equivalent amounts after exceptional items and certain
re-measurements are reflected in note 6 and are reconciled at Group level in the Group Income Statement. Certain re-measurements and exceptional items are described in note 8.
Adjusted earnings and adjusted basic earnings per share are reconciled to their statutory equivalents in note 13. All current financial results listed are for the 12 months ended 
31 December 2007.
The Group adopted IFRS with effect from 1January 2005. The comparative data for 2004 has been restated accordingly. IAS 32 and IAS 39 were adopted with effect from 1January 2005, and the
comparative data for 2004 does not reflect the effect of these standards. Amounts in years prior to 2004 are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards (GAAP) in the UK
prevailing at the time. Turnover prior to 2004 excludes Accord trading revenue.
All references to ‘the prior year’, ‘2006’ and ‘last year’ mean the 12 months ended 31 December 2006 unless otherwise specified.

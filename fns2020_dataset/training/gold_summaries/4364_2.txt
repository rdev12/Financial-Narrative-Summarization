MARKET OvERvIEW
Market developments globally and at the 
local level are opening up tremendous 
opportunities for all our businesses. 
Geopolitical forces and changing 
demographics are shifting the economic axis 
towards Asia and emerging markets. New 
patterns of consumer behaviour are creating 
different challenges for digital content 
delivery and feeding demand for precisely 
targeted information. 
Technology is reshaping the competitive 
arena. Nearly half a billion smartphones are 
already in the hands of consumers. Big data, 
mobile connectivity, cloud services and 
social networking are combining to deliver 
on the promise of rich, detailed information 
to every individual no matter where they are.
With a third of the world now online 
compared with just 8% a decade ago, we 
now have many more potential customers. 
They are more engaged and more 
demanding about the services they expect. 
Increasingly, tailored and insightful content is 
at a premium. Our challenge as content 
providers is to get high quality, relevant 
information to the right people, where and 
when they want it. 
STRATEGy AND PERFORMANCE OvERvIEW
DMGT’s strategic ambition is to become  
a global-growth company with increasing 
exposure to emerging economies and 
high-growth markets. We aim to achieve  
that by growing our business-to-business 
operations, developing our consumer media 
franchise and diversifying internationally into 
high-growth markets.
The Group delivered a solid set of results in 20 1 2, 
with underlying revenue and operating profit 
up 3% and 7% respectively. More than half of 
operating profits were earned outside the UK.
Our international B2B companies increased 
both revenue and profits. 
RMS delivered another solid year of revenue 
and profit growth. The company continues  
to have strong growth prospects. It now  
offers a broad portfolio of products and  
data solutions. It is also seeing many more 
international opportunities. 
dmg::information contributed healthy 
increases in revenue and operating profit. 
Each of its four sectors – property, education, 
energy and finance – contributed. 
dmg::events registered 13% underlying 
growth in a year in which just one of its three 
marquee biennial events was staged. 
Euromoney Institutional Investor maintained 
its impressive history of profits growth. Its 
business has been transformed in recent 
years. Subscriptions now account for just  
over half of total revenues. 
The UK consumer business performed well in 
challenging trading conditions. 
At A&N Media, underlying revenues were up 
slightly, and operating profit rose strongly. This 
pleasing result demonstrates the success of 
our strategy of combining the best traditional 
and new media content in ways that make 
sense for our consumers. 
The Mail titles continued to outperform the 
market. Our free newspaper, Metro, also 
performed strongly. Our regional newspaper 
group, Northcliffe, improved profitability 
despite the secular decline in its revenue 
base. 
MailOnline had an excellent year, becoming 
the world’s most popular English language 
newspaper website in 2012. Our recruitment 
portal Evenbase acquired Jobrapido to 
extend its international footprint. Digital 
Property Group’s (DPG) merger with Zoopla 
has created a formidable new UK property 
search portal. 
PRIORITIES FOR ThE COMING yEAR
The strategic priority for RMS remains its new 
platform, RMS (one), scheduled for a 
mid-2014 launch. It continues to develop 
supporting programmes, which are 
expected to yield additional revenue in 2013. 
dmg::information’s ambition to invest in 
must-have, high-growth, innovative business 
information companies remains unchanged, 
as does its remit to diversify DMGT by sector, 
by business model and by geography. 
dmg::events is expanding its significant 
footprint in the Middle East into Saudi Arabia, 
and on to Asia. It will continue to extend its 
successful global energy division. It is also 
developing digital solutions to complement 
its live events portfolio.
Euromoney continues to pursue its strategy  
of growing international, digital and 
subscription-based revenues. 
A&N Media’s new print facility in Thurrock  
will yield significant cost reductions and 
environmental benefits. It will invest to drive 
even faster growth in its core digital 
businesses, particularly MailOnline.  
Mail Newspapers will launch paid-for  
tablet editions. 
At Evenbase international expansion remains 
a key priority. Our online discount business 
Wowcher is continuing to build up its 
database of affluent young female 
subscribers. Zoopla Property Group is 
implementing its integration plan following  
its recent merger with DPG.

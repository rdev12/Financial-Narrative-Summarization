 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Principal Activities 
The Group had a difficult 2014, resulting in a significant 
downturn in revenue and profit. Group revenue for the 
year was £13,684,000 (2013: £18,095,000) and there was 
a £1,951,000 loss before tax after providing for £813,000 
(2013: £nil) of impairment charges on the Linford Wood 
property compared to a profit before tax of £1,269,000 
in 2013.
The basic loss per share was 4.90p (2013: basic earnings 
per share 4.38p). Cash holdings at the end of 2014 were 
£3,612,000 (2013: £3,680,000). The Board recommends 
that no final dividend be paid (2013: 0.4p per share).
The Group suffered three substantial setbacks. The 
structural changes to academic qualifications in the UK 
secondary education market caused a decline in demand 
for examination marking services; sales were lower in 
the overseas education markets for the Group’s more 
established products and services, in particular scanners and 
printing; and the Group did not have any new large-scale 
census or election projects in the year. 
As a result, UK education revenue decreased by 6.6% 
to £9,872,000 (2013: £10,570,000) and international 
education revenue decreased by 35.3% to £3,155,000 (2013: 
£4,880,000). Overall education revenue reduced by 15.7% 
to £13,027,000 (2013: £15,450,000).
The absence of new large-scale census and election projects 
in the year resulted in a decrease in non-Education revenue 
to £657,000 (2013: £2,645,000).
The reduced profitability resulting from the downturn in the 
Group’s general level of business activity has necessitated 
an impairment of the value of business assets carried on the 
balance sheet, in accordance with International Accounting 
Standards. This has resulted in the value of the Linford Wood 
property, the Group’s head office location, being reduced 
to its most recent commercial valuation of £1,600,000, 
being a reduction of £813,000 which is recognised as a 
non-cash impairment charge to the Income Statement. This 
adjustment was made in June 2014 and was reflected in the 
half year results.

 STRATEGIC REPORT
Sir David Brown
Chairman The Board
No changes were made to the Board of Directors in 2014 but 
two are foreseeable in 2015. I will be retiring from the Board 
when my present term expires, at the conclusion of the 2015 
AGM, having by then served for nearly seven years including 
six years as Chairman. The process to select my successor is 
under way. After completing his full term as a non-Executive 
Director, John Linwood will be retiring at the conclusion of 
the 2015 AGM and the Board thanks him for his service.
Outlook
The Board intends to continue to pursue a strategy of 
progressively strengthening and exploiting its software-based 
services business model so as to maintain its position in the 
UK market and seizing opportunities for diversification in 
selected education markets overseas, with a particular focus 
on core examination processing solutions.
In line with this strategic focus, in March 2015 we were 
pleased to announce a new three year contract with one of 
our principal customers in the UK, AQA Education, which 
extends our relationship to 23 March 2018.
Following the downturn in 2014 the Group implemented 
appropriate cost saving measures to better align operating 
costs with the reduced level of revenue. These measures 
are expected to stabilise the business and underpin a better 
performance in 2015.

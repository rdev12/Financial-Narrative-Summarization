Introduction
As reported in the interim results, 2009 has seen a period of weak 
demand from our major customers and this has been a difficult 
backdrop against which to continue the transition of the Group from 
manufacturer to solutions provider.
Nevertheless, despite the poor economic climate, I am delighted to 
be able to report that the benefits of this transition have allowed the 
Group to show improved underlying profitability despite reduced 
turnover. Operating profit, before exceptional items, increased by 
45% in 2009 to £750,000 (2008: £516,000). EBITDA before 
exceptional items grew in the same period by 53% to £1,845,000 
(2008: £1,208,000).
Exceptional items totalling £1,005,000 were incurred during the year 
mainly as a result of further restructuring of the Group. These costs 
contributed to an overall loss before taxation of £599,000 (2008: 
loss of £484,000).
The highlight of the year was undoubtedly the signing of an 
enhanced contract with Wm Morrison Supermarkets plc. Morrisons 
is a long-established and valued customer of the Group and we are 
delighted to extend that relationship into the foreseeable future.
Results
The impact of weak demand saw Group turnover fall by 12.5% 
compared to the prior year. This is a larger fall than reported at the 
half year, but was expected given the strength of demand 
experienced in late 2008. Turnover in the second half was slightly 
less than reported in the first half (3% down) but operating 
profitability was higher in the second half, as a result of the cost 
reductions implemented earlier in the year.
With an improvement in the sales mix, gross margin percentage 
increased to 35.9% from 32.6% in the prior year, reflecting the 
benefits of the move from manufacturing to services and the 
consequent restructuring of the business. Savings in our operational 
cost base have been made and Group headcount has been 
reduced by 17% during the course of the year, resulting in a 
reduction in staff costs of 19%. It is also worthy of note that two
of the Group’s four segments actually grew their turnover during
the year.
Operating profit, before exceptional items, represents a 5.1% 
operating margin, compared to 3.1% in 2008. The 9% reduction in 
administrative costs was a significant component of this 
improvement.
During the year we incurred significant restructuring costs of 
£801,000 (2008: £534,000), as we continued the transition from 
manufacturing to solutions provider. Incurring these costs enables 
the Group to proceed with a much reduced cost base and 
enhanced operational gearing. As the wider business community 
recovers confidence and normal levels of capital expenditure 
resume, the Board anticipates that this reduced cost base should 
allow the Group to benefit from a recovery in demand for our 
products and services. We continue to pay close attention to our cost 
base, although we would not expect further exceptional costs of the 
scale reported here in the foreseeable future.
Approach by Brulines Group plc
The approach by Brulines Group plc was a significant event during 
the year. Whilst we remain in an offer period there is no agreement 
for Brulines to undertake any due diligence on the Company. 
However, it is also worth noting the impact on trading that an 
approach of this sort can have. The requirement to obtain Brulines’ 
consent resulted in a frustrating and unavoidable delay in signing 
the Morrisons’ contract. This delay impacted 2009’s results, and in 
addition significant costs were incurred primarily relating to 
increased advisers’ fees.
The approach from Brulines continues to be a significant distraction 
for the management team whose main focus has to be guiding the 
Group through these difficult economic conditions. It is worth 
repeating here that the Directors remain committed to delivering 
value to all of the Group’s shareholders.
Annual General Meeting
At the 2009 Annual General Meeting a proposed resolution to allow 
the Group to issue share options or to raise funds via a placing did 
not receive sufficient shareholder support. After significant changes 
to the management team over the last two years the Group is 
unable to align the team’s interests with those of its shareholders, a 
situation which the Board does not believe is satisfactory. In addition, 
the Group’s ability to raise funds if necessary via a placing is equally 
important. Obtaining additional debt finance currently is both 
expensive and difficult, and without recourse to potential sources of 
equity funding the Group runs the risk of missing out on 
opportunities that may arise.
For these reasons, enabling resolutions will be proposed at the 
forthcoming AGM and I would urge all shareholders to vote in 
favour.

Board of Directors
After 23 years of outstanding service, both in an Executive and a 
Non-Executive capacity, Barrie Brinkman has decided to stand down 
as a Director at the conclusion of the 2010 Annual General Meeting.
I thank Barrie for his contribution over the years.
Dividend
Whilst we continue to focus on delivering growth in profits, the 
availability of funding to deliver such growth impacted results in 
2009. The receipt of £1 million of further funding from our bank late 
in the year should not disguise the difficulties of obtaining finance 
during 2009. The existing credit facilities require significant capital 
repayments during 2010, and consequently we do not recommend 
paying a dividend for the year. We will continue to review the 
position regarding future dividend payments as the Group 
progresses.
Outlook and Prospects
Being able to report an increase in underlying profitability, despite a 
reduction in turnover, shows the progress that has been made. 
However, the challenge for 2010 is to return the Group to a position 
of turnover growth whilst maintaining that increased underlying 
profitability. Progress in winning new business is being made in all 
four divisions of the Group and coupled with the restructuring that 
has already occurred, turnover growth would provide the Group 
with a firm foundation for future enhanced profitability.

Roll-out of the WL3 Firewall™ product
Waterlogic successfully rolled out the new 
WL3 Firewall™ purifying water dispenser 
during the year. The product will encourage 
the take-up of premium sparkling systems 
in key markets such as Germany, France and 
Scandinavia and will also spearhead growth 
of the sparkling category of Waterlogic 
products in both the USA and Australia.
Consumer launch in Japan
Waterlogic signed a five year agreement 
with ALCONIX for the distribution of consumer 
products in Japan. 
The five year distribution agreement grants 
Waterlogic exclusivity for the supply of water 
dispensers to ALCONIX, who in turn becomes 
the sole distributor of Waterlogic Consumer 
products to the Japanese market. The 
agreement has volume commitments in place 
for the first year and includes certain performance 
clauses. The volume commitments for the 
following years of the agreement will be 
negotiated in line with the Group’s expectations.

Firewall™ technology product in France

benchmarking contract with ORPEA, 
a European leader in dependency care. 
The contract with ORPEA successfully 
delivered over 1,000 Waterlogic Firewall™ 
purifying water dispensers by the end of 
the year. This strategic focus on the tangible 
benefits and value of Firewall™ technology, 
which commands a premium price in the 
market as a result, led to a strong performance 
recovery in France in the year.

Sales case study – Southend-on-Sea
Martin & Co Southend-On-Sea launched as a lettings office in 2001. In 
2012, the office branched out into sales and in the last 12 months alone 
has listed 101 properties for sale, agreed sales on 31 properties and 
generated a sales income of £22,235. Offering sales has allowed 
franchise owner, Tony Lindberg, to offer a more comprehensive service 
to existing landlord clients, and also attract new clients who need 
assistance with the buying and selling process.
Tony, who previously had a retail background, said: “Offering sales 
provides me with more scope to expand and enhance my business.  
We have already built a solid lettings business and receive a profitable 
income from this, but sales provides a new stable way forward to 
improve the bottom line. Regardless of future market changes, as our 
business is underpinned by lettings we are confident that we will 
always remain successful even through leaner sales market periods.” Annual Report and Accounts 2013

 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
The 52 weeks to 30 August 2008 stand out as a tremendously successful year for Carr’s,
with revenue up by almost 50% and pre-tax profit more than doubling. This performance,
driven by our largest Division, Agriculture, reflects our continuing strategy of growing our
core businesses in new areas by developing new brands and new markets, as well as the
incidence of one-off favourable factors relating to the purchase of commodities at a time 
of substantially rising prices. We have well invested facilities that efficiently produce the
cost-effective products we manufacture and sell.
The year was an extraordinary one for
commodity prices. Many of our key raw
materials in the UK - feed and milling wheat,
soya and rape meal - more than doubled 
and fertiliser rose three to four fold. These
increases reflected increased demand from
China and India for agricultural products,
combined with low world commodity stocks
and growth in bio-fuel production, after 
many years of static markets. 
Less dramatic than the rise in commodity
prices was the 40% increase in the farm-gate
milk price paid to the Group’s dairy farming
customers. This increase provided a
substantial boost to the Group’s business. 
Financial Review 
Revenue in the 52 weeks to 30 August 2008
increased by 47% to £372.3m (2007:
£252.8m). The pre-tax profit was up 133% 
to £12.9m (2007: £5.5m), and fully diluted
earnings per share were 91.2p (2007: 49.9p),
up 83%. Net finance costs of £1.6m (2007:
£1.0m) were covered 8.0 times (2007: 5.8
times) by Group operating profit of £12.9m
(2007: £5.8m), up 123%. Adjusted to subtract
non-recurring items and amortisation of
intangible assets totalling £0.1m (2007: to
add £0.6m), adjusted pre-tax profit was up
111% to £12.8m (2007: £6.1m) and fully-
diluted adjusted earnings per share were up
94% at 106.9p (2007: 55.0p). 
The Board estimates that in the region of
£4.1m of the pre-tax profit was of an
02   Carr’s Milling Industries PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2008 exceptional trading nature: £2.9m inventory
gain, when the cost of raw materials was
rising very fast; £0.7m due to the early buying
of fertiliser by farmers for the autumn 2008
and spring 2009 season so as to avoid
anticipated price increases; and £0.5m
currency appreciation on forward foreign
exchange contracts.
Total shareholders’ equity decreased by 7% 
to £25.0m (2007: £26.8m), the profit for the
period of £8.3m being off-set by £8.8m of
actuarial losses net of tax in the retirement
benefit obligation as a consequence of poor
investment returns, increased inflation, and
strengthened mortality assumptions. Despite
substantial increases in revenue and working
capital, up £6.9m in the period, net debt
increased by only £2m to £17.4m (2007:
£15.4m), representing gearing of 70% (2007:
57%). 
Subsequent to the year end, in September
2008, £2.5m (net) was raised in a placing 
of 410,000 new Ordinary Shares (4.9% of 
the issued share capital) at 660p per share. 
The object of the placing was to fund, in 
part, the additional working capital
requirement and to widen the institutional
shareholder base. Reflecting the placing, pro
forma gearing at 30 August 2008 falls to 55%.
Dividends
As announced on 5 September 2008, the
Board is proposing a 26% increase in the 
final dividend per share to 17.0p (2007:
13.5p). If approved by shareholders at the
Annual Meeting on 6 January 2009, the
dividend will be paid on 16 January 2009 
to shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 19 December 2008, with the
shares going ex-dividend on 17 December
2008.
Together with the interim dividend per share
of 6.0p (2007: 5.5p), up 9%, paid on 9 May
2008, the proposed dividends per share for 
the year total 23.0p (2007: 19.0p), up 21%,
covered 4.0 times (2007: 2.7 times) by basic
earnings per share and 4.7 times (2007: 2.9
times) by adjusted earnings per share. This
would be the seventh successive annual
increase in dividends per share and the total
proposed for the year is almost three times 
the 8.0p paid seven years ago, in 2001 – 
a compound annual increase of 16%.
Outlook
Agriculture is most unlikely to enjoy a
repetition of this year’s exceptionally
favourable commodity prices. It will, however,
be boosted by its UK dairy-farming customers
benefiting from October’s 1p increase in the
farm-gate milk price, which was badly needed
in the context of increases in input costs. US
animal feed will benefit from the continuing
success of that business, as well as the
translation effect of the strengthening US
dollar. 
Food will benefit from a better start to the
current year and lower milling wheat prices,
but has to contend with higher energy costs. 
Our Engineering business commences the
year with a strong order book, with contracts
for the nuclear decommissioning programme
and the oil and gas sectors. 
Overall, the Group remains well-placed for
the current year, albeit without the benefit 
of exceptional trading conditions in its largest
Division, Agriculture.

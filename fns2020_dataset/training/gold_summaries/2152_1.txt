Asterand plc - Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
Chief Executive’s Business Overview
In the US, the National Cancer Institute has stated that the lack of 
availability of appropriately collected and annotated human 
tissue is one of the major barriers to the development of new cancer 
therapies.
At Asterand, we are trying to change this.
Our customers are large, global pharmaceutical companies, striving to 
discover and develop new drugs. Not just for cancer, but for many diseases. 
Our customers use human tissue in target discovery, in validating new 
compounds (safety, efficacy), in the search for biomarkers, in the quest 
for personalised medicine. Demand is growing strongly. 
At Asterand, we collaborate closely with our customers. We marry our 
customers’ requirements with our ability to source and annotate the 
human tissue. Increasingly, we carry out the experiment on the human 
tissue ourselves, using our customers’ candidate compounds.
We are not a drug discovery Company – we are a solutions Company.
We have had a very good year in 2008. Our core revenue increased by 
46% (at constant exchange rates) to £11.8 million. We became profitable 
for the first time as a plc, our core business (excluding licensing and gain 
on insurance proceeds) showing EBITDA of £1.7 million (a £3.2 million 
improvement on the previous year). On top of this, we successfully out-
licensed select compounds to Allergan, in a deal that included an upfront 
payment to Asterand of $6.25 million (£3.4 million). As a result, our total 
EBITDA profit for 2008 was £3.8 million; our cash position at the end 
of 2008 was £6.9 million, with no long term debt and an as yet unused 
credit line.
So, how was this achieved?
In June 2007, shortly after I joined the company, we announced a strategic 
plan. The key tenets of our strategy were to enhance our selling model 
by developing more collaborative relationships with our key customers; 
to improve the Company’s tissue supply logistics to ensure availability 
of the specimens our clients need most; and to increase the Group’s 
operational efficiency to reduce our costs and improve profitability. I am 
pleased that we are making significant progress in these areas. 
We replaced   six of the eight members of our international sales 
team in the third quarter of 2007. We also formed an alliance with 
Eolas Biosciences to improve our presence in Japan. We now have 
an experienced, high performing commercial team, and have had 
no staff turnover in this team in 2008. We sought more intimate 
relationships with our customers, formed via a consultative 
approach tied with a global key account perspective and where 
appropriate involved our scientists to improve our understanding 
of our customers’ needs. At the end of 2008, the company had 
eleven global master service agreements (MSAs) in place with major 
pharmaceutical and biotech clients, seven of which were signed 
in the last two years. Our global MSAs designate Asterand as the 
preferred provider for human tissue solutions at all of these clients’ 
sites. Furthermore, Asterand’s client base now extends into nearly 
all of the top 30 pharmaceutical companies.  
  We completed an initial $2.9 million contract with the US Department 
of Defense (DoD) to review, assess and provide recommendations 
on the optimal research use of its specimen repository. The 75 
million samples within this repository span the period from 1917 
to the present and represent some of the rarest diseases known 
to mankind. We are pleased to have completed this assessment 
swiftly and successfully. Our recommendations will influence the 
development of the DoD’s proposals to attain the best use of these 
samples in the future. In addition, this contract has served as the 
foundation for a new human tissue related service offering for the 
Company. We now intend to utilise the expertise we’ve developed to 
offer consultancy services to leading companies and institutions on 
the development and management of their biorepositories.
The Company continued the implementation of a LEAN Six Sigma  
program throughout its lab operations throughout 2008. The 
standardisation of key processes resulted in improvements to 
lab processing...increasing sample throughput by 79% utilising 
essentially the same number of staff in the lab. Further improvements 
during 2008 resulted in an additional 43% reduction in time spent 
on this key process. We plan to undertake reviews in other key areas 
of the business in 2009. 
During 2008, we sought to unlock value from our dormant therapeutic  
portfolio. As I previously mentioned, Asterand successfully executed a 
licensing agreement for our R99 eye disease programme to Allergan. In 
addition to the upfront payment, the agreement also includes provisions 
for success based milestone payments that could push the realised 
value of the agreement to $56 million (plus royalties). In January 2008, 
we announced that a compound we had previously out-licensed to BTG 
successfully entered a placebo/controlled Phase I study to assess its 
safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile in healthy volunteers. 
We believe that there is additional value within our portfolio and we are 
now seeking partners for these therapeutic programmes. 
In 2007, we changed all of our management team with the  
exception of one person. We changed the CEO, the CFO, the US 
General Manager, the VP of Sales and Marketing and the heads of 
scientific development. We have kept this same core team together 
throughout 2008; I now feel that we are hitting our stride.  5
Asterand plc - Annual Report and Financial Statements 2008
We were pleased to be named one of the top 20 “Best Places to  
Work” for 2008 in a survey conducted by The Scientist magazine 
which ranked more than 200 healthcare/life sciences companies in 
the United States and Europe. The award serves as a validation of 
our efforts to create a vibrant, challenging environment where our 
employees feel appreciated for their contributions in helping our 
customers develop new therapies against disease.
In the latter half of 2008, the world experienced an unprecedented 
economic crisis. Our strong results have been achieved even in the midst 
of this. So far at least, we appear to be recession resistant; the reasons 
that companies need to use our services appear to be increasing, not 
decreasing. We will continually monitor lead indicators of demand, and 
also the impact of merger activity on our client base.
Going forward, we plan to continue our focus on customer intimacy; 
on effective logistics; on management and employee development; and 
on releasing value from our IP portfolio. We will particularly focus on 
strengthening our links with the hospitals with which we collaborate, 
and on establishing new such global collaborations.  We hope to grow 
organically along with the total market, and also to grow by penetrating 
the market that has previously been met by academic institutions (which 
we estimate at 70% of the total).
In addition to organic growth, our strong cash position and cash 
generative business model gives us a runway for further investments 
in the core business and/or potential mergers and acquisitions. We are 
now prudently assessing our options.
Our goal is to meet our customers’ needs in this space, to become the 
clear leading company and to build sustained profitability and growth, 
whilst at the same time making a difference in the lives of ordinary 
people. We believe that the exceptional progress Asterand has exhibited 
during 2008 will serve as a foundation for the Group’s continued success 
in 2009 and beyond.
Martyn Coombs 
CEO, Asterand plc
“These are strong results. The strategy 
that we put in place in the second half 
of 2007 is now starting to show results. 
We have doubled our revenues, our core 
business grew at 46%, and we became 
profitable for the first time as a public 
company. Not just marginally profitable: 
our EBITDA was £3.8 million. Going 
forward, we intend to continue our 
strategy.
In addition to organic growth, our 
strong position gives us a runway 
for further investments in the core 
business and/or potential mergers and 
acquisitions. We are now prudently 
assessing our options.”

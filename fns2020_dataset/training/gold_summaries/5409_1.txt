Performance review 2008
In 2008 the Group generated organic growth 
from both established Group operations and 
recent new additions. We entered new markets 
(including Finland, Estonia and Romania) and 
new sectors (including engineering in China, 
corporate training in SE Asia and healthcare  
in the Nordics and the Baltics). In addition,  
we added new fee earners where growth 
opportunities allowed, strengthened our  
central management team and invested  
in new financial management systems.
We started 2008 expecting to experience  
more challenging trading conditions at some 
point in the year. Caution as to the market 
outlook prompted us to call off negotiations  
on a number of potential investments in 
Continental Europe and South America as  
well as reduce the planned number of start- 
up investments and new branch openings. 
However, trading conditions over the first three 
quarters remained benign across our markets. 
Only in the financial services sector did we see 
evidence of significant market deterioration  
and, despite this, we were still able to generate 
significant profits from our financial services 
companies in London and Tokyo. Despite the 
change in the economic environment in the last 
quarter, the Group continued to grow revenues.  
In the UK, the Construction and Property 
Services sector continued its strong organic 
growth, driven principally by demand within the 
transport and infrastructure industries. This was 
supported by a consistent contribution from our 
Financial Services and Other Brands. Trading in 
the last quarter of 2008 for our Supply Chain 
division declined reflecting challenging 
conditions within the retail sector. 
In Continental Europe, Headway, our German 
business, which is by some margin the largest 
of our operations, grew revenues by 7% in the 
year. Growth rates stalled in the last quarter, 
reflecting the impact of a weakening German 
economy. In July 2008 we invested in 
MediradiX, a supplier of medical staff operating 
in Finland and Estonia, which made a positive 
contribution in the second half of the year and 
continues to perform well.
Our Rest of the World division grew revenues 
and net fee income in 2008 significantly ahead 
of the previous year, mainly from a combination 
of start-ups and small acquisitions made in 
2006 and 2007. Alternattiva in Chile contributed 
strongly in its first full year in the Group.
Market and business overview
Empresaria’s strategy has been to gain access 
to international growth markets and to reduce 
exposure to individual economies through 
geographic and sector diversification. Whilst  
as a specialist staffing organisation our financial 
performance is somewhat dependent on the 
fortunes of the specific markets we serve, our 
strategy has proven successful over time and 
given the relatively low market share of our 
companies there remains scope to grow share 
even in more challenging trading conditions.
Over the last six months we have seen a 
substantial change in the global economy. In 
the face of this change we expect the Group to 
be resilient relative to the staffing industry as a 
whole, aided by the fact that the majority of our 
net fee income is derived from more stable

temporary staffing operations and because  
of our strong ownership culture. The sense of 
responsibility that this culture engenders, and 
the levels of creativity and entrepreneurialism 
that it generates, sets Empresaria apart from 
more traditional business structures.
Due to challenging market conditions, and the 
expectation that it will take time for the global 
economy to see any material improvement,  
the Group has adjusted its short term priorities 
and approach. We look at the Group as an 
investment portfolio with each company 
challenged, monitored and, above all, assisted 
in achieving its growth plans. Where group 
companies have been adversely affected by the 
economic conditions, represent a commercial 
risk or have limited growth potential, we are 
taking appropriate action.  
In some cases this has led to a write down in 
the carrying value of investments in our balance 
sheet. This notwithstanding, in the current 
economic climate we still have a number of 
strong and successful businesses that are 
growing and we are committed to provide the 
resources required to support this growth.

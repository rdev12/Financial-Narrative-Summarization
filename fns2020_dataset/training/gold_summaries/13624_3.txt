 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT THE PAST YEAR HAS SEEN ROTORK
CELEBRATE ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY IN A PERIOD WHEN STRONG
TRADING HAS ENABLED US TO ACHIEVE RECORD RESULTS AND 
A SOUND POSITION FROM WHICH TO ENTER 2008.
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
The past year has seen Rotork
celebrate its 50th anniversary in 
a period when strong trading in
each of our underlying markets
has enabled us to achieve record
results and a sound position from
which to enter 2008. We have
passed a number of milestones
including record performances in
terms of revenue and proﬁts from
each of the three operating
divisions and ﬁnished the year with
our highest ever reported order
book, up 29% at £98m. Total sales
revenue was £236m, up 14% on
2006, and proﬁt before tax
increased by 24% to £57.3m. 
The trading ﬁgures are after the
negative impact of currency in a
year where the weakening US
dollar reduced the value of part of
our earnings. However, in spite of
this currency headwind, we were
still able to improve operating
proﬁt margin from 21.8% to
23.5% due to operational gearing
and the robustness of Rotork’s
business model. At constant
currency, sales revenue and proﬁt
before tax increased by 18% and
31% respectively.
DIVISIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
Rotork Controls
The oil & gas, power and water
markets, which the Controls
Division serves, continued to be
active in the year particularly in
Asia and Europe. The new
production facility in Shanghai
had a successful ﬁrst full year in
operation and met all of its goals.
This facility will be of increasing
signiﬁcance in supporting the
important Chinese market in 
the future.
The division increased revenue to
£164m, up 11% on the prior year
with operating proﬁt at £44m, up
18%. We now believe that the mix
of facilities that we have in the
Controls Division across the world
gives us the capacity to support
our customer base in each of our
markets for the foreseeable future.
New marketing initiatives took
place in the year and we opened
our ﬁrst direct presence in Brazil. 
Rotork Fluid Systems
Rotork Fluid Systems continued 
its pattern of strong growth
established over the last few years,
and expanded its share of the
available market as well as
capitalising on the signiﬁcant
investment currently being seen
worldwide in the markets for its
products. Sales revenue grew 18%
to £48m and operating margin
achieved our 15% target. We are
increasingly being seen as
providing the actuator of choice 
by leading industry participants.
This has been helped by our
exacting approach to product
quality, constant investment in
facilities and products, and our
drive to bring technology originally 
developed for our electric actuator
products into our Fluid Systems 
product offering.
Rotork Gears
Rotork Gears produced strong
results in the year, with sales
revenue up 31% at £32m and
operating proﬁt up 57% to £7m.
We are now the largest
manufacturer of products of our
type, and have production facilities
in ﬁve countries in Europe, the US
and Asia. We can effectively offer
a local service to customers
wherever they are based from our
global facilities. We are continually
improving products and services,
and developing new products for
use on standard and specialist
applications. The net margins in
this business have increased as we
continue to improve efﬁciency and
reduce costs.

ANNUAL REPORT 
& ACCOUNTS 2007  CASH
Cash generation in the year has
been strong due to the buoyant
trading position and good control
of working capital. In addition,
except for a £2m additional
contribution to the UK ﬁnal salary
pension scheme, there have been
no unusual cash outﬂows in the
year with the result that cash
balances increased at the year end
to over £38m. Subsequent to the
year end, we announced two
acquisitions. The acquisition of
Remote Controls Sweden was
completed on 30 January 2008 
for a consideration of £13m. 
Much smaller, but strategically
important, was the acquisition of
the intellectual property and
business of the Drallim SVM
product on 13 February 2008, 
for £630,000. Both of these
transactions were settled for cash. 
DIVIDEND
The Board is recommending an
increase in the ﬁnal dividend for
2007 and the payment of an
additional interim dividend for
2008. The ﬁnal dividend for 2007
of 14.0p per share (an increase of
20% year on year) will be paid on
9 May 2008 to shareholders on
the register on 18 April 2008. 
A one off additional dividend 
of £10m (11.5p per share) will 
be paid on 18 July 2008 to
shareholders on the register on 
27 June 2008. 
PERFORMANCE AND RISK
In his Business Review, the 
Chief Executive discusses the
application of the Group’s
approach to performance
measurement through KPIs, 
our approach to the assessment
and mitigation of risk, and how 
we ensure that we have correct
health & safety procedures, and
environmental policies. We take
great care to deal with these
matters responsibly, ensuring 
that controls and processes are
embedded in working practices
where possible and that reporting
is prompt and transparent. 
Our increased disclosure this 
year underscores the importance 
which we attach to these matters.
BOARD CHANGES
John Matthews has been the
Senior Independent Director 
since joining the Board in 1998
and for much of this time has
chaired both Audit and
Remuneration Committees.
Having now completed nine years
on the Board, John will retire 
at the forthcoming AGM. 
He leaves with our best wishes
and appreciation for his much
valued advice and support.
I am pleased to welcome John
Nicholas to the Board as a non-
executive director. John is currently
Group Finance Director of Tate &
Lyle plc prior to which he held the
same position at Kidde plc. He will
chair the Audit Committee and be
a member of both the Nomination
and Remuneration Committees. 
BILL WHITELEY
Bill Whiteley, who will retire at this
year’s Annual General Meeting,
has been a director of Rotork p.l.c.
for twenty-four years, the last
twelve of which he has served as
Chief Executive. During his tenure
as Chief Executive, Bill has led the
Group to outstanding success and,
consequently, its world leadership
position in its specialised sector
and its position as a highly rated
constituent of the FTSE 250. He
leaves a strong and experienced
executive team who under the
leadership of his successor, Peter
France, are well placed to deliver
further growth. On behalf of the
Board I extend to Bill our
appreciation and gratitude for his
enormous contribution and wish
him well for the future.
OUTLOOK
Projects across nearly all of our
geographic and end user markets
remain active. Order intake at the
start of the year has been
particularly buoyant, including 
a strong start from our North
American and Chinese operations.
In contrast with recent years, it
would appear that our trading
results are likely to be enhanced 
by a more favourable currency
environment in 2008.

For the financial year to June 2008 the
group is planning to continue its strong growth.
I am delighted with the early performance
of the three companies which DCD acquired
in August 2007, and I am confident that they
are on the road to deliver the added value
to shareholders that we had anticipated.
DCD has developed a stronger stable of top
class producers of content across a wide
range of genres and with a large and growing
number of clients, with extra benefit through
the vertical integration provided by our
in-house distributor.
The group is now recognised as a significant
independent media producer spanning the
entertainment, factual, drama, arts and media
event management sectors. In addition to
continuing organic growth, it remains part of 
the group’s strategy to continue to make further
acquisitions within other genres where it believes
commercial synergies will result.
DCD is strengthened by the acquisition of three
new businesses in August 2007, Prospect Pictures,
September Films and West Park Pictures, which
are all established in their respective production
genres – Prospect in lifestyle programmes,
September in factual entertainment and West 
Park in documentaries. DCD recognises that 
the industry is consolidating but its own rate of
growth means it will now be ranked within the
UK’s top ten independent producers by turnover.
This strengthens the ability of the group to drive
new revenue opportunities through:
● economies of scale through operating synergies
across the group
● recognition gained across a wide range of
television production genres
● new relationships being developed both in 
the UK and abroad from the contacts of the
acquired companies – the opening of the door 
to US broadcasters via September Films is
considered one of the most important factors 
in that acquisition
● maximisation of the benefits from vertical
integration by pushing more product through 
an expanded distribution division.
DCD has the capacity to sell its programmes to
online distributors and more such opportunities
will open up. It has a pool of talent which bears
comparison with the best any independent

74578 DCD PRE 1  15/11/07  15:33  Page 8 producer can offer, and will establish an
organisational structure to allow the creative
heads to think outside their normal remits to
develop new ideas and products.
Deal structure of acquisitions announced 
in August 2007
The group has acquired the entire issued share
capital of each of Prospect Pictures Limited,
September Holdings Limited and West Park
Pictures Limited. These companies operate in 
the areas of lifestyle TV, factual entertainment 
and international documentary TV production.
Completion of the acquisitions took place on 
7 August 2007.
In each case the vendors were the company’s
management, who all agreed to accept new
service agreements lasting at least three years,
and who all received half their consideration in
cash and half in DCD Media shares which were
locked in for two years (plus a third year through
an orderly market agreement with the group’s
brokers). The new subsidiaries are therefore run
by a highly incentivised management congruent
with DCD Media plc objectives to help it grow 
and prosper.
Funding of Acquisitions
Similar to the previous trio of acquisitions, each of
the companies acquired was bought on a multiple
of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation of nine times or less, based on
current and historic performance, with a forward
multiple of seven.
The aggregate consideration amounted to
approximately £19.1 million, comprising 
£9.37 million in cash, £0.18 million in loan notes
and £9.55 million in new Ordinary Shares. DCD
raised £8.5 million before expenses via a placing 
of 10,625,000 new Ordinary Shares with certain
institutional investors at 80 pence per share
following a planned 100 for 1 share consolidation.
In addition, the group raised £4 million of
convertible loan from institutional investors.
The board believes the acquisitions meet the
group’s criteria for growth by acquisition and will
help to capitalise on the opportunities becoming
available as the market consolidates.
● September Holdings Ltd
The total consideration for the acquisition was
£9.06 million, comprising £4.53 million in cash
and £4.53 million satisfied by 5,662,152 new
Ordinary Shares.
● Prospect Pictures Ltd
The total consideration for the acquisition was
£7.05 million, comprising £3.35 million in cash,
£0.18 million in loan notes and £3.52 million
satisfied by 4,406,250 new Ordinary Shares.
● West Park Pictures Ltd
The total consideration for the acquisition was
£2.96 million, comprising £1.48 million in cash
and £1.48 million satisfied by 1,850,391 new
Ordinary Shares.
Outlook
The outlook for the group is positive for a number
of reasons. It has acquired three new production
companies with only a minimal increase in central
costs, so that nearly all their contribution to cash
earnings flows through to the Operating Profit.
Each of these companies is growing in line with
expectations, and synergies are emerging.
The Directors are comfortable with the
performance of the pre-existing production 
and distribution divisions, which continue to 
deliver as anticipated. These have all been
successfully assimilated into the DCD group, 
and the seamless way in which this occurred 
has more recently been mirrored by the
consolidation of the new acquisitions.
9
74578 DCD PRE 1  15/11/07  15:33  Page 9 Chief Executive’s Review continued
The group is now a widely diversified entity, with a
number of successful brands but no over-reliance
on any one, and with a very wide client base in 
the UK and abroad. In the period under review 
no single client represented more than 10% of
turnover, and DCD had over 200 clients. With the
three acquisitions then joining, the list of clients
has broadened further.
A simple, vertically-integrated structure; 
the best talent locked in and incentivised; a 
diversified client base; the ability to create 
and own content across all media; and an
acquisition strategy built on immediate earnings
enhancement and the addition of shareholder
value: these are the watchwords by which DCD
Media is continuing to grow, and which will ensure
that the outlook remains favourable for some
distance into the future.
Despite recent industry hiccoughs at the BBC 
and ITV, the outlook for DCD is favourable as the
BBC has announced that it will focus on areas 
in which DCD is strong and is formalising 
WOCC (The Window of Creative Competition) 
which may lead to an expansion of the 
potential independent market of £250m, 
and ITV has pledged to continue to seek the 
best programming from whatsoever source.
The net effect of the changes that have ensued
there makes the prospects for DCD no less
favourable than before. DCD has remained 
unaffected by the recent ethics and phone
revenue problems at the BBC and ITV.
Further growth is anticipated, organically and by
acquisition. DCD Media plc is a work in progress,
but one which is already demonstrating the
benefits of its strategy.
Financial Overview 
Trading Results
Group turnover grew by 101% to £26.8m (2006:
£13.3m) with the group’s three acquisitions from
2006 contributing a full year of consolidated
contribution for the first time. In the prior year
these three acquisitions contributed to turnover 
for approximately six months out of that year 
of trading.
Gross profit increased by 88% to £5.8m (2006:
£3.1m). The gross margin has remained steady 
at 22% (2006: 23%), a slight decrease on the 
prior year due to the higher costs of set up and
manning a presence in the U.S.
The full year of additional contribution of new
businesses has driven central, administration,
sales and distribution costs to £5.4m up from
£4.1m in 2006. Consequently, administrative costs
now represent 20% of turnover, a significantly
reduced proportion compared with 31% in 2006.
This measure represents a significant indicator 
in driving efficiencies across the overall group.
Operating profit increased by £1.4m to £0.4m
before exceptional item (2006: Loss £1.0m)
reflecting the contribution of prior year
acquisitions, after an amortization charge 
on goodwill of £1.2m (2006: £0.7m).
The group’s management believes that a better
representation of earnings is by reference to
Adjusted Profit before Tax, taking account of 
non-cash deductions against operating profit.
Adjusted Profit before Tax stood at £1.36m up 
from a loss of £0.3m in 2006. 
10
74578 DCD PRE 1  15/11/07  15:33  Page 10 The board previously considered the alternative
measure of Earnings Before Interest Depreciation
and Amortisation (EBITDA). However, this measure
does not provide a satisfactory reflection of 
non-cash related normalised operating income
and expenditure. For information only, during 
the period of review, reported EBITDA rose to
£8.0m (2006: £2.2m).
Earnings per share is disclosed in note 2 below.
Balance Sheet
Net current assets increased to £2.0m (2006:
£1.4m) reflecting the delivery of programmes
during the period allowing a production loan to 
be repaid, and the value of new productions in
progress at the period end.
Net funds stand at £1.0m (2006: £1.5m) reflecting
increased net interest payments in the period of
£0.5m (2006: £0.2m) and timing differences due 
to funding of programme production towards the
end of the period.
Interest cost arises from the full year cost of 
long term debt, which at the year end, stood at
£7.3m (2006: £7.7m) and reflects a Convertible
Loan raised during the prior year to finance 
earlier acquisitions. 
Shareholder funds remain steady at £21.3m 
(2006: £21.3m) reflecting the result for the period.

Founded in 2000 by award-winning producer Gub Neal,
formerly Head of Drama at Channel 4 and Controller of
Drama at Granada Television, Box TV produces event-drama
for film and television. In its first six years, the division has
overseen more than £50m of production. Box TV became part
of DCD Media in December 2005.
This division continued to grow its reputation in the large scale
drama sector. It delivered the BBC One Christmas hit ‘The
Wind In The Willows’ starring Matt Lucas and Bob Hoskins 
and award-winning mini-series ‘Bon Voyage’ for ITV1 both 
of which achieved high ratings and acclaim.
Its most recent addition to the creative department, executive
producer Adrian Bate, contributed a major ITV1 drama entitled
‘Affinity’, from the novel by the writer of ‘Tipping The Velvet’
and ‘Fingersmith’, while founder creative head Gub Neal won
Box TV’s biggest ever commission, for a 5 part thriller series
‘The Last Enemy’ for BBC One.
Box TV is expected to conclude ‘Affinity’ during the coming
period, with the premiere of the completed ‘The Last Enemy’
due to be announced shortly for primetime BBC airing. The
productions continue to derive sales in both UK and foreign
markets, and there is reason to anticipate further profits from
them, as well as the previous successes completed in the 
prior year. 
Box TV has a strong outlook, with a number of projects 
in development.

74578 DCD PRE 1  15/11/07  15:33  Page 16 The company is a major producer of weekday entertainment
programmes featuring cookery and other lifestyle subjects. 
It has a high volume of low cost productions and recurring
output contracts, which provide stable and visible earnings.
Founded in 1988, Prospect Pictures (Prospect) joined DCD
Media in August 2007.
For the domestic market, Prospect specialises in live,
interactive lifestyle programming such as ‘The Cooks!’ series,
but it is also developing factual entertainment formats and
documentaries for the international market. A subsidiary of
Prospect Pictures, Cardiff-based Prospect Cymru Wales,
specialises in the creation and production of English and Welsh
language television programmes for Welsh based broadcasters
(such as BBC Wales and S4C). Among independent producers
Prospect is one of the largest suppliers, making over 500 hours
of television for UK broadcasters in 2006.
The company’s long standing specialism in food programming
persuaded ITV to contract Prospect for a two year period
to supply the channel with daytime food output. As a
consequence of this Prospect recently created its own
website, www.cooksforcooks.com, to exploit its extensive
archive in this genre.
Prospect Pictures has a healthy outlook, with a fourth series of
ITV’s ‘Daily Cooks!’ commissioned, ‘Saturday Cooks!’ currently
airing on ITV1 and a second series of ‘Christmas Cooks!’ due
to transmit on the same channel daily over the festive period.

Volga at a Glance
Our assets are located in an established oil and gas province. The area 
benefits from the existing rail, road and pipeline infrastructure and 
proximity to Russia’s main energy markets.
The main achievement of 2013 was the gas 
processing plant capacity expansion which 
led to a doubling of daily throughput since 
November 2013 and which will enable full 
exploitation of the Group’s principal gas/
condensate fields.

Notes:
1. The reserves and production numbers shown exclude all volumes related to the Sobolevskoye field which was 
not included in the Miller and Lents reserve study of 2012. The numbers for Sobolevskoye are estimated by 
management not to be material in the context of total Group reserves.
2. There has been no external reassessment of reserves subsequent to the Miller and Lents reserve study of 2012.
3. The above reserve estimates, prepared in accordance with reserve definitions prepared by the Oil and Gas 
Reserves Committee of the SPE, have been reviewed and verified by Mr Mikhail Ivanov, Director and Chief 
Executive Officer of Volga Gas plc, for the purposes of the Guidance Note for Mining, Oil and Gas companies 
issued by the London Stock Exchange in June 2009. Mr Mikhail Ivanov holds a M.S. Degree in Geophysics from 
Novosibirsk State University. He also has an MBA degree from Kellogg School of Management (Northwestern 
University). He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. VOLGA GAS PLC

Dobrinskoye gas processing plant
2013 Progress
Completed the third phase of the gas plant 
upgrade and received regulatory authorisation. 
Doubled daily throughput in November 2013 to 
over 500,000 cubic metres per day (17.8 million 
cubic feet per day).
2014 Objectives
Complete the final phase of the gas plant 
upgrade and achieve certification of plant 
processing capacity of up to 1 million cubic 
metres per day (35.3 million cubic feet per day).
Vostochny Makarovskoye (“VM”) gas/condensate field
2013 Progress
Workover of the VM#1 well led to a major 
increase in production capacity of the well and 
of the field.
2014 Objectives
Drilling of two new wells, VM#3 and VM#5 to 
increase production capacity and utilise the full 
planned gas plant capacity.
Dobrinskoye gas/condensate field
2013 Progress
Production capacity remained steady. However 
during 2013 the gas plant capacity was 
preferentially utilised for production of gas and 
condensate from the VM field.
2014 Objectives
Manage production from the two existing wells 
to maximise long term extraction of gas and 
condensate.
Uzenskoye and Sobolevskoye oil fields
2013 Progress
Managed Uzenskoye production for the fifth 
year, with production constrained to prevent 
water cut. Started production from the single 
well Sobolevskoye field.
2014 Objectives
Maintain/enhance production profile and 
maximise extraction of oil from existing wells.
Exploration activity
2013 Progress
Completed a review of exploration prospects in 
the Karpenskiy licence area and several material 
prospects have been identified. Decision to 
relinquish Pre-Caspian Licence and of the 
exploration areas of the Urozhainoye-2 Licence.
2014 Objectives
Potential discretionary exploration drilling of 
shallow, supra-salt targets during 2014.

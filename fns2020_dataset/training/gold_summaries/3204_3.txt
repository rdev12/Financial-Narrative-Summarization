 04 Centrica plc report 2002 
Chairman’s statement
During 2002, Centrica continued to
make progress towards our vision
of ‘taking care of the essentials’ for
customers in our chosen markets.
We have done this by concentrating
on what our customers want. This
has led to top-line growth across
our business units and helped drive
adjusted earnings per share up
26% (before exceptional items
and goodwill amortisation).
We took significant steps to
ensure that British Gas remains
the market leader in residential
energy and continues to improve
its performance in other home
services. The AA had a year
of solid performance as we
repositioned the AA brand to
increase awareness of the wide
range of products and services
available to motorists. Our North
American business has made
progress despite a challenging
regulatory environment.
Centrica remains
well placed
to compete in
an increasingly
international energy
marketplace where
we expect further
consolidation.
In the UK, the measures to
underpin a competitive energy
market enable us to continue
to deliver benefits to customers.
In the wider European context,
good progress was made
towards agreeing a framework 
for introducing competition
to the entire energy market.
In addition a number of important
improvements were made to the
competitive conditions in the UK
telecoms market but there is still
further work to be done.
Dividend
The board of directors is proposing
a final dividend of 2.6 pence per
share to be paid in June 2003.
When combined with the interim
dividend of 1 .4 pence per share
paid in November 2002, the
total dividend for 2002 would
be 4.0 pence per share. This
represents an increase of 29%
on the previous year and reflects
our positive medium term outlook
for both earnings and cash flow.
The board of directors
We announced a number of
changes to the board during the
year. Sir Sydney Lipworth retired
at the annual general meeting
in May and we are most grateful
for the significant contribution
he made to the development
of Centrica. In September we
announced the appointment
of Helen Alexander and in
October the appointment of
Robert T obin as non-executive
directors with effect from 
1 January 2003. I am delighted 
that Helen and Robert have joined
us. Their considerable experience
will further strengthen the board. 
Corporate responsibility
We recognise that creating
sustainable shareholder value
depends on a full understanding
of our impact on society and
the responsible management
of our business in a manner
consistent with our values
and principles. T o this end,
we established a corporate
responsibility committee 
which sets the framework for
developing and reporting our 
efforts in this area. Our approach
was recognised by our inclusion 
in the FTSE4Good and Dow Jones
Sustainability indices. 
We recognise
that creating
sustainable
shareholder value
depends on a
full understanding
of our impact
on society.
The future
Centrica remains well placed 
to compete in an increasingly
international energy marketplace
where we expect further
consolidation. Our strong brands,
enhanced customer insight and
asset management expertise,
combined with our financial and
operational scale, will continue
to enable us to create value for
customers and shareholders alike.
The collective efforts of all Centrica
employees have ensured that
we have made further progress
towards our vision during 2002. 
I would like to thank them for their
commitment and I look forward 
to working with them to deliver the
business performance, which will
provide our customers with the
service that they want and reward
our shareholders appropriately.
Sir Michael Perry GBE
Chairman
Our strong brands, enhanced customer insight and
asset management expertise will continue to enable
us to create value for customers and shareholders.

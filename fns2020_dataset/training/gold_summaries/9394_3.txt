 This is my first Statement since being appointed Non-Executive
Chairman in December of 2002. In fact, it is only the Company’s
second set of annual results since its admission to the London
Stock Exchange’s Alternative Investment Market (‘AIM’) in 
July 2001.
LiDCO raised funds from the public market in order to commence
the commercialisation of its minimally invasive sensor and PC 
based monitoring technology. I was therefore excited to join the
Company at the end of its first full year of sales activity in both the
USA and the UK. In reviewing its 2002 performance I am aware
that this was a challenging period for the Company.
The challenge was to establish a new technology in a market
sector that requires change but where standards are necessarily 
of the highest order.This meant that in parallel to the sales effort
the Company had to transition its operations successfully to a
fully commercial basis with the capacity to become the supplier
of choice for the minimally invasive monitoring of risk surgery
and intensive care patients. Specific achievements to this end
included clinically validating the technology, increasing revenues
while maintaining pricing and gross margins, establishing and
assessing the marketing strategy for the USA and the UK,
automating and significantly increasing sensor manufacturing
capacity and positioning the Company to expand sales in 
2003 through registration of the Company’s in vivo diagnostic
(lithium chloride) in additional major European markets.
Towards the end of the year, the Board decided that the best 
way of maximising access to the US, our largest market, would 
be through a distribution agreement with a partner and that
given the progress made by the Company during 2002, this 
could be achieved on commercially attractive terms.To this 
end the Company has begun early discussions with potential 
US distribution partners.We remain confident of 
our prospects in 2003.

By investing through Hargreaves
Lansdown our clients saved more than
£180 million on investment charges last
year. This was achieved by cutting the cost
of the charges levied by investment fund
managers on more than 1,700 funds.
Savings up to 5.5% on initial charges can
help get investments oﬀ to a ﬂying start
and if the value of the investment grows
so will the value of the saving.  The chart
below shows the diﬀerence between a
client investing £10,680 into an
investment fund with no discount, and a
client investing through the HL Vantage
service with a saving of 5.5%.

 Chairman’s statement
Christopher Miller
Chairman
I am pleased to report our 12th 
set of annual results since 
flotation in 2003.
2014 has been another successful 
year. Elster, our gas, electricity 
and water metering company 
acquired in 2012, continues to 
demonstrate the benefits of our 
management model.
In November 2014 we sold Bridon, our 
wire rope maker principally for the mining 
and oil & gas sectors, for an enterprise 
value of £365 million. In line with our 
strategy we have announced a capital 
repayment of £200 million which will be 
paid on 16 March 2015. With only Brush 
remaining from our FKI acquisition in  
2008, this nearly completes that 
acquisition cycle. 
Since making our first investment in 2005, 
Melrose has achieved an annual return on 
equity investment of 23% and an increase 
in operating margins of 5 to 7 percentage 
points across each of the businesses we 
have owned. Total shareholder return  
over the same period has been 421%, 
compared to 104% for the FTSE 350.
By implementing our strategy, following  
the Return of Capital, we will have created 
approximately £2,782 million of shareholder 
value with a net shareholder investment  
of £170 million.
As ever, I would like to thank all our 
employees for their efforts in helping  
to produce this outstanding performance.
Results for the Group
Revenue from continuing businesses  
for the year was £1,377.5 million  
(2013: £1,466.4 million) and headline  
profit before tax (before exceptional  
costs, exceptional income and intangible 
asset amortisation) was £212.5 million 
(2013: £191.5 million). 
Further details of these results are 
contained in the Finance Director’s review 
on pages 42 to 49.
Trading
Elster continues to perform strongly  
in all three divisions with orders and  
sales in Gas, the largest division, in 
particular, showing pleasing increases  
in constant currency terms. Whilst the  
bulk of restructuring and product 
rationalisation is behind us there is 
nevertheless an ongoing programme  
of efficiency gains which we expect  
will add to the substantial improvements 
already achieved in operating margins. 
Investment in all divisions continues and 
the purchase of Eclipse on 31 October 
2014 for US $158 million is an exciting 
addition to Elster Gas which will make  
a good contribution in its first full year.
In our Energy division, Brush continues  
to experience difficult end markets with its 
OEM business. While it is pleasing to note 
that independent market research shows 
Brush has more than maintained its market 
share, nevertheless the forces at play 
holding down OEM demand do not appear 
to be dissipating in the near term. In the 
medium and long term, however, we have 
full confidence that this market will recover. 
In the meantime, the Aftermarket and 
Switchgear divisions are performing well.

Strategic Report “ Our strategy is working: for a net shareholder 
investment of £170 million, and with a current 
market capitalisation of £3.0 billion, we have 
created £2.8 billion of shareholder value.”
We encountered foreign exchange 
headwinds in 2014 and while these have 
abated somewhat in recent months as 
regards the US Dollar, the further 
weakness in the Euro and the Rouble 
suggest a further 5% headwind in 2015 
based on current exchange rates.
Further discussion of trading appears  
in the Chief Executive’s review on page 14.
Dividend
The Board proposes to pay a final dividend 
of 5.3p per share (2013: 5.0p). This will be 
paid on 18 May 2015 to those shareholders 
on the register at 17 April 2015, subject to 
approval at the AGM on 14 May 2015. This 
gives a total for the year of 8.1p per share 
(2013: 7.75p).
We continue to pursue a progressive 
dividend policy.
Strategy
Since Melrose’s flotation in 2003, and the 
introduction of our “buy, improve, sell” 
strategy, we have seen many changes in 
economic and stock market conditions. 
Nevertheless, through all this, returns to 
shareholders have been extremely good 
and we see no reason to diverge from  
our proven strategy. We continue to see 
situations which are candidates for our 
management and investment methods  
and we are confident we will identify  
a suitable opportunity in due course.  
In the meantime, we will continue to  
improve our existing businesses, and will 
make disposals at the appropriate time.
Outlook
The world economy continues to be 
geographically patchy. Strength in the  
USA is mirrored by weakness in most  
of Continental and Central Europe – a 
situation which seems unlikely to change  
in the near future. Adjusting for currency 
effects, our Group is trading in line with 
management expectations for 2015 
despite the expected downturn in the 
performance at Brush. In our Elster 
businesses, we see the potential for  
good demand and growth prospects,  
as indeed we have seen in the second half  
of 2014. This, together with the opportunity 
for further margin enhancement, and the 
possibility of a value creating acquisition, 
gives us confidence for the balance of 
2015 and beyond.

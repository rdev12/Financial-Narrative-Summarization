 Trading performance
The Group made a total operating loss for the
year of £6.0m (2007 – operating profit of
£0.9m) on sales of £12.1m (2007 - £17.5m).
The principal reasons for the decrease, which
are discussed in more detail below, were:
• £0.7m loss in respect of Mallett’s antique
and fine art business;
• £3.3m loss in respect of write downs in
the cost of the Group’s antique and fine
art inventory;
• £1.9m loss in respect of Meta.
Antiques and Fine Art
In the first half of the year, turnover of £8.0m
(2007 - £10.7m) was only 6% down on the
same period for the prior year, after excluding
the £2.2m generated from the auction of 550
items at Sotheby’s in March 2007. However,
in the second half of the year turnover fell to
£3.8m (2007 - £6.8m) which represents a
43% decline on the same period for the prior
year. The majority of this decrease occurred
in the final quarter of the year and was a direct
result of the severe downturn in economic
conditions which led to a number of deferred
and cancelled sales.
The geographical split of turnover remained
relatively constant between the UK and US
showrooms, with the UK generating 65% of
the Group’s turnover and the US generating
35%. The US benefited from a strengthening
of the dollar against the pound towards the
end of the year, but felt the impact of the
recession earlier than the UK. James Harvey
British Art enjoyed a good start to trading as
a separate entity, with sales for the year of
£1.2m, although the economic downturn
caused sales to slow in the final quarter.
Hatfields continues to grow with turnover
increasing to £1.1m from £0.5m in 2007.
The change in trading conditions in the final
quarter had a direct impact on the Group’s
operating results and led to the Group,
excluding Meta, moving from an operating profit
of £0.5m for the first 6 months of the year to
an operating loss, before inventory provisions,
for the full year of £0.7m (2007 – operating
profit of £0.9m).
Inventory provisions
In response to the significantly changed
market conditions in the antique and fine art
market, the Board decided to carry out a full
internal and external revaluation of the Group’s
inventory. As a result of this the Board has
decided to write down the cost of a number
of items of stock by a total of £3.3m. This
represents 17% of the inventory cost and the
Board believes represents a prudent revaluation
of stock held given the current market
conditions and difficult selling environment.
Meta
Meta is a new business launched by Mallett
in 2008 after three years of planning and
preparation. It is focused on the creation of
contemporary objects and furniture of the
highest quality. The first Meta collection, which
was launched to critical acclaim in April 2008,
consists of 11 exemplary pieces that are
offered for sale in numbered editions. Meta
complements the Mallett brand, enabling
Mallett to develop new relationships with key
influencers and target new clients in both
traditional and new markets.
Meta is an unprecedented undertaking in
contemporary design and the execution of its
first collection presented remarkable technical
challenges. The initial launch, planned for
December 2007, was delayed for four months
while these were resolved. Sales in the
8 months since launch in April were £305,000,
with a further £140,000 of confirmed orders
in production. Total expenditure by the Group
for the year on Meta was £2.2m, which
represents £1.3m of costs up to and including
launch (compared to the £1m originally
budgeted) and a further £0.9m on production,
distribution and marketing costs since launch,
resulting in an operating loss for Meta of
£1.9m. Following cost-cutting it is envisaged
that Meta will make a small profit in 2009.
No costs have been capitalised in respect
of Meta, and no new collection is planned
for 2009.

Balance sheet
Shareholders’ equity at 31 December 2008
was £21.2m (2007 - £26.2m) which represents
a £5.0m reduction from the prior year.
Inventories at 31 December 2008 are valued
at the lower of cost and net realisable value
at £16.1m (2007 - £18.4m). At the end of the
year a full internal and external revaluation of
the Group’s inventory was carried out. This
resulted in a write-down on a number of
specific items totalling £3.3m, which
represents 17% of the inventory value before
the write-down.
Net debt at 31 December 2008 stood at
£2.3m (2007 – cash surplus of £2.0m).
The deterioration in the cash position is
largely due to the combination of poor trading
in the last quarter of the year, the launch
costs of Meta and the payment of the further
interim and final dividends in respect of 2007.
In November 2008 we increased our credit
facility with our bank, Coutts & Co, by £1m to
£3.5m in order to provide increased working
capital headroom. The Group is in compliance
with all of its covenants under the credit facility.
Dividends
The Group made a loss after tax of £4.3m
(2007 – profit after tax of £0.9m) and
therefore, taking into account the cash
position of the Group, the Board has decided
not to recommend a final dividend for the
year (2007 final dividend – 3.8 pence per share).
The Company will therefore be paying no
dividend in respect of 2008.
Corporate activity
On 31 December 2008 George Magan retired
as Chairman of the Company and left the
Board. He was succeeded as non-executive
Chairman by Lord Daresbury, who joined the
Board of the Company in 2007. On 13 January
2009 Lanto Synge stepped down as Chief
Executive of the Group. He was succeeded
by Giles Hutchinson Smith who joined the
Board in 1999. The Board of Mallett are very grateful to
George Magan and Lanto Synge for their
outstanding contribution to the Company,
George since he became Chairman in 2000
and Lanto since he joined the Company in
1969 and became Chief Executive in 1997.
Outlook for 2009
The extremely challenging economic conditions
we experienced in the later part of 2008 are
expected to persist in 2009. Although visibility
remains limited, sales have stabilised in the
first quarter of this year. Perceptions of value
in the antiques and fine art market have been
reinforced by the outcome of major fairs and
auctions in the first quarter of 2009.
This suggests that the market for antiques
and decorative arts is proving more robust in
the current environment than may have been
anticipated.
We expect to achieve cost savings of almost
£2m in 2009 through a combination of more
closely targeted marketing expenditure;
savings in staff costs (staff numbers have
been reduced by 20% since mid-2008,
including redundancies); and the non-
recurrence of our initial investment in Meta.
This year, we also plan to take appropriate
opportunities to improve our cash position
through selective stock sales. The Board
remains comfortable with the group’s working
capital outlook for the year.
We are actively examining ways of further
improving Mallett’s cost profile through
relocation to suitable premises. We continue
to review all opportunities to streamline the
business in the light of prevailing market
conditions, while ensuring that Mallett
remains well placed to achieve its longer term
potential in an evolving global marketplace.

The current environment
The market for antiques and decorative arts is
proving more robust in the current environment
than may have been anticipated.
A fine quality large-scale 19th century
Shibayama carved ivory elephant ornamented
in the traditional manner with elaborate
mother-of-pearl and semi-precious stone
enrichments. An elephant with a raised trunk
is an auspicious Asian symbol of good fortune
and hospitality.
Shibayama is an art form originating in the
town of the same name in Japan and intact
Shibayama pieces are rare and so are highly
valuable and collectable.

Chairman’s Statement
In the middle of the year, ambiguity about the impact of 
sanctions on the business forced Ruspetro into both 
cla r i fi c a t i o n s 	 a n d 	 c o n t i n g e n c y 	 a r ra n g e m e n t s 	 t o 	 e n su re 	
that operations were not hampered. In due course, that 
u n c e r t a i n t y 	 wa s 	 cla r i fi e d 	 a n d 	 o u r 	 te ch n o l og y 	 ha s 	 be e n 	
cleared for use.
Thereafter, what started as a modest decline in the oil 
price to below US$100 per barrel in the third quarter 
became a headlong plunge, coupled with a slump in the 
value of the ruble. While some stability has emerged in 
recent months in both the oil price and ruble/dollar 
exchange rate, the credibility of forecasters has gone, and 
we expect to live with both volatility and uncertainty for 
the medium term.
This macro-economic business context makes the 
transformational restructuring transaction that we 
completed in December all the more remarkable. Our 
l ia b i l i t i e s 	 ( i n cl u d i n g 	 d ebt 	 a n d 	 p u t 	 o pt i o n 	 o b l i g a t i o n s ) 	 w e re	
reduced by US$218.8 million, while we raised US$52.3 
million of new equity, and arranged loan facilities of up to 
US$144.7 million, in aggregate, for development and 
working capital. 
More important perhaps than the numbers is the 
relationship now established between Ruspetro and 
Otkritie, currently the largest private bank in Russia by 
assets. Otkritie and Sergey Gordeev are now our main 
lender and largest shareholder, respectively, and we are 
delighted that Sergey has joined our Board.
Successfully raising substantial development funds is a 
major milestone for the Company, and while the fall in oil 
prices impacted our revenues, the weakening of the ruble 
has driven down our dollar cost base such that we can drill 
economically attractive production wells at current oil 
prices. Nevertheless, given the extended period of low and 
volatile oil prices, the Board has decided that a cautious 
capital expenditure programme and a cautious use of loan 
facilities in 2015 is in the best interests of the Company, 
and that the capital invested should focus on maturing 
development opportunities for the medium term. This 
philosophy is outlined in the CEO’s review. 
It remains unclear how the oil and gas industry in Russia 
will respond in the medium term. A material reduction in 
activity seems unlikely given the dollar-equivalent cost 
reduction that all operators will experience. However, we 
can expect some opportunities to drive costs down further

In 2014, for a small 
exploration and 
production company 
operating with a 
technically-challenging 
portfolio, the business 
environment in Russia 
could hardly have been 
more difficult. Strategic Report

Our focus is on positioning Ruspetro for the medium 
term: understanding our reservoirs, managing risk, 
applying the right mix of technologies, enhancing our 
reputation as an innovative company and creating value 
from every well that we drill. In the medium term, this is 
expected to build substantial shareholder value. 
When 2014 started, there was a strong sense of optimism 
in Russia, particularly given the Winter Olympics in 
February. The dramatic events since, including ruble 
devaluation and unexpected crash in oil prices, have 
caused anxiety, and their consequences remain to be seen. 
However, within Ruspetro, we have made substantial 
progress in the way that we operate and think. We have 
rebuilt our technical core and our technical credibility. On 
behalf of the Board, I would like to thank all our staff for 
t h e i r 	 ef fo r t s 	 u n d e r 	 d i f fi c u l t 	 c i rc u m st a n c e s 	 a n d 	 i n 	
particular welcome to the team those who have come on 
board in the last 12 months. 
I would also like to thank our new partners for the 
c o n fi d e n c e 	 t h e y 	 ha ve 	 s h ow n 	 i n 	 j o i n i n g 	 t h e 	 Ru spet ro 	
project. We welcome them as shareholders and in 
particular welcome Sergey Gordeev to the Board. We have 
a highly experienced team of Non-Executive Directors on 
the Board and I would like to thank them for their 
invaluable input and challenge. Lastly, I thank our 
shareholders for their support as we have navigated our 
wa y 	 t h ro ug h 	 d i f fi c u l t 	 ma cro e c o n o m i c 	 c o n d i t i o n s 	 a f fe c t i n g

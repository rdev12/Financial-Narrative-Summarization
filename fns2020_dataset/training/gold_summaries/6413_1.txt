Chief Executive’s review
to £29.6 million (2012: £17.7 million). 
Net revenues increased 123% to 
£12.3 million (2012: £5.5 million), 
driven by new business and 
organic growth. The business 
delivered strong organic growth in 
Europe, started receiving income 
derived from newly regulated 
Internet gaming in the United 
States and made significant 
progress positioning the Group 
for continued growth in the 
United States.
Strategy
Expansion in the United States 
remains a strategic priority for the 
Group following the establishment 
of a dedicated sales and 
infrastructure support office in Las 
Vegas, Nevada during the year. 
During the year the Group entered 
into landmark agreements with 
both Betfair for regulated real-
money Internet gaming in New 
Jersey and with Foxwoods® Casino 
Resort, America’s largest casino, 
for Simulated Gaming™, in 
advance of potential regulation, 
being a compelling converged 
Internet gaming enterprise 
solution designed for land-based 
casinos seeking to move online 
ahead of anticipated regulation of 
real-money Internet gaming. 
Regulated real-money Internet 
gaming and Simulated Gaming™ 
remain the primary growth 
opportunities in the United States. 
Extending the convergence 
capabilities of the Group’s 
GameSTACK™ Internet gaming 
system (IGS) remains a strategic 
priority, extending GameAccount 
Network’s substantial lead in 
offering land-based US casino 
operators the ability to converge 
their customers’ experience across 
land, online and mobile. Mobile 
casino gaming in particular 
represents a continued strong 
growth opportunity with gross 
income derived from mobile 
casino gaming growing 
substantially in 2013. In Europe, 
the Group continues to prepare for 
growth opportunities consequent 
to newly regulated casino slot 
gaming in Spain and is 
consolidating its position in Italy’s 
regulated casino slot Internet 
gaming market by delivering an 
expanding breadth of casino slots 
content to its major Italian 
operator partners.
Products
During the year the Group 
completed the development of 10 
online casino games for its casino 
equipment manufacturer clients 
including Aristocrat, Incredible 
Technologies and Ainsworth 
Game Technology, bringing the 
Group’s total games portfolio 
inherent within the GameSTACK™ 
Internet gaming system to 135. In 
2013 new casino equipment 
manufacturer clients of the 
Company’s game development 
services included Multi KONAMI 
Gaming in the United States, 
GamoMAT in Germany and Reel 
Time Gaming in Australia, with 
online facsimiles of their machine-
based casino slots scheduled for 
delivery in 2014.
By the year’s end the Company 
completed development of the 
unique Simulated Gaming™ 
product offering designed to 
enable land-based casino 
operators in the United States to 
move online in advance of 
regulation of real-money Internet 
gaming. Simulated Gaming™ 
combines the Company’s real-
money Internet gaming technology 
platform, recognisable Class III 
casino gaming content and the 
land-based casino operator’s 
brand. Augmented with a carefully 
constructed monetisation model, in 
2014 US land-based casinos have 
the opportunity to launch online 
casinos embedded within their 
existing news and information 
websites and offering a legal 
Simulated Gaming™ entertainment 
Overview
GameAccount Network has made 
significant progress in delivering 
its enterprise software solution, 
gaming content and supporting 
services to major operators with a 
particular focus on the newly 
regulated intra-State markets 
emerging in the United States. 
During the year the Group signed 
a landmark agreement with Betfair 
and subsequently delivered its 
enterprise Internet gaming solution 
into New Jersey’s newly regulated 
Internet gaming market for Betfair, 
operating in partnership with New 
Jersey casino operator Trump 
Resorts International. Throughout 
the year GameAccount Network 
continued delivering a diverse 
range of machine-based casino 
slot games online for casino 
equipment manufacturers. The 
Group experienced strong organic 
growth in Italy’s newly regulated 
online casino slots market and 
continued to win new business in 
both Europe and the United States. 
During the year, the Group 
achieved double-digit financial 
growth, with gross income up 67%

experience online to residents 
anywhere within the United States.
GameAccount Network also 
continued to develop its industry-
leading casino product and 
service offering with a particular 
focus on the Group’s SENSE3™ 
mobile solution comprising 
multi-game native apps for iOS 
and Android, HTML5 casino 
games and responsive design 
websites. Major beneficiaries of 
this historic and continued 
investment in mobile capability 
include the Group’s client casino 
equipment manufacturers today 
relying upon GameAccount 
Network to develop online 
equivalents of their Class III 
machine-based slot games and 
distribute them online in Europe 
and the United States, enabled for 
real-money Internet gaming as 
well as Simulated Gaming™. 
Throughout 2013 the Group 
delivered substantially extended 
convergence capability within the 
GameSTACK™ Internet gaming 
system by completing two 
incremental integrations with 
major land-based casino 
management systems, being those 
employed by Foxwoods® Casino 
Resort in Connecticut and Trump 
Plaza in New Jersey. Convergence 
between a traditional land-based 
casino and a new online casino 
experience enables seamless 
customer journeys maximising the 
casino operator’s ability to 
monetise their customer database 
and extend online beyond the 
typical geographic radius in which 
their traditional customers reside. 
The continued investment in 
convergence supports the Group’s 
proven ability to enable traditional 
land-based casinos to move online 
and deliver an Internet gaming 
experience which supports and 
accelerates their existing gaming 
business through increased 
on-property visitation and 
increased local market share.
Marketing and support services
Throughout 2013 the Group 
significantly expanded its support 
services capability for operator 
customers using the 
GameSTACK™ as their primary 
platform for Internet gaming. 
Services are an increasingly 
important component in delivering 
an enterprise gaming solution to 
land-based casino operators and 
include the provision of managed 
payment processing, predictive 
analytics, CRM and online 
acquisition marketing services 
across all major online acquisition 
channels together with expertise 
in converting and reactivating 
land-based patron databases into 
online players. The marketing, 
CRM and analytics capabilities of 
the GameSTACK™ back office and 
associated integrated reporting 
systems enable the provision of a 
turn-key service to land-based 
casinos seeking to move online 
consequent to, or in advance of, 
real-money Internet gaming 
regulation. Income derived from 
services creates an incremental 
income opportunity for the Group 
and diversifies the business in a 
manner complementary to the 
core software licensing business.

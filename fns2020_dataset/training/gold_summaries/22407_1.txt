 Chief Executive Officer’s review
In my previous annual review, I referenced
the fact that the year to May 2007 had
been our first full year as a listed company
and that I was surprised that it had, to
a great extent, been business as usual.
This year we have been tested rather more
both by way of markets and also our clients’
reaction to the events in the markets.
Market volatility
First, using the MSCI emerging markets
index (MXEF , as shown below) as a
proxy for about 95% of our business, we
have had to deal with some significant
volatility over the past year. During
August and September as the index rose
towards 1,350 we reduced the beta across
our clients’ portfolios to around 0.7.
In addition we increased cash during this
period, from close to zero to nearly 5%.
As a relative return manager each of our
accounts is obviously measured against a
benchmark and as a result we are not
prepared, or in some mandates allowed,
to increase cash to above 5%.
In terms of our beta management we had
calculated that at the end of October the
index was trading at a standard deviation
of around 4X expensive, this being
the most expensive in around 20 years
according to our calculations. Both
of these risk controls assisted in the
out performance that we achieved over
the next few months and by the end
of March 2008 we had achieved a
significant level of out performance
against all of our Emerging Markets
benchmarks. We maintained this level
of out performance to the end of the
financial year.
Rebalancing
Second, and as referenced in the bar chart
on page 9, we have over the past year
dealt with a significant level of rebalancing
away from our asset class as a result of
our asset class’s out performance when
compared with other asset classes and also
as a result of our own out performance
against the benchmarks. What is shown
on page 9 is inflows (blue), outflows
(yellow) and net (red). Over the financial
year the cumulative net outflow was $224
million (light blue).
Over the past 24 months, the totals were
$1,059 million out and $673 million in,

MSCI emerging markets index
Whilst in the overall
scheme of things we
remain a small specialist
boutique manager, we do
intend to continue to grow
our business as long as we
do not compromise our
investment performance. City of London Investment Group Plc Annual Report 2008 9
leading to a net outflow of $386 million.
An explanation needs to be provided
to shareholders regarding these events
because the amounts are very
significant in terms of our total funds
under management.
As a relative return manager we are
given an amount of money to manage
for, let us say, an endowment. This
endowment will have decided to place,
let us say, 5% of its assets in an emerging
markets mandate. Let us further assume
that the consultant who has both
screened and assisted in the appointment
of CLIM has suggested that the
allocation to the emerging markets
should be maintained within a band of
4% to 6%, and that this has been agreed
by the endowment’s committee. At the
point that, as a result of the emerging
markets out performing the other asset
classes within the endowment’s portfolio
(further assisted by CLIM’s out
performance), the exposure gets to let
us say 7%, it is quite likely that we
would receive a rebalancing request thus
placing the endowment’s exposure to
emerging markets via CLIM back
within the 4% to 6% range.
In fact as referenced earlier we have
replaced these departing assets with
new client assets of $673 million
over the past two years.
Going forward the outlook is
considerably better as not only have
rebalancing requests (yellow) reduced
significantly recently, but in addition
we are continuing to receive substantial
inflows as shown below. I would further
add that in the event that the Emerging
Markets were to underperform for a
period (as long as our performance was
maintained) we would be likely to be
the beneficiary of rebalancing in the
reverse direction.
Put another way, as an institutional
manager we are not subjected to the
volatility of subscriptions and redemptions
of many retail houses, rather our
subscriptions and redemptions (which
are generally monthly events) are
reflected as above. Obviously, subject
to ongoing satisfactory investment
performance the existing assets should
remain very sticky.
Cost control
As you are aware we try very hard to
run a low cost business. Over the past few
years we have reduced the cost/income
ratio of our business from 53% to 28%
(as measured before profit-share and
treating third party marketing commission
and custody as a deduction from fees
rather than as an expense). Whilst in the
overall scheme of things we remain a
small specialist boutique manager, we
do intend to continue to grow our business
as long as we do not compromise our
investment performance. We have been
quite successful in continuing to expand
our non-US business which now represents
28% of our total FUM as compared with
17% in March of 2006. Over the next
year I would hope to be able to report
further success with particular emphasis
from a product perspective in areas such
as Frontier Markets, Natural Resources
and our Developed Markets closed-end
fund business.
Charles River implementation
In keeping with our strategy for the
continuing development of our business
we have selected The Charles River
Investment Management System (CR
IMS) to further automate front office
processes and streamline the portfolio
management, trading and compliance
monitoring of our global operations.
CLIG will benefit from extensive portfolio
management tools, integrated trade order
management and real-time pre-trade
compliance testing and monitoring on
a scalable platform. Implementation of
the CR IMS has been initiated and we
expect to complete the first phase of this
project early in the 2009 calendar year.
Most fund managers would perhaps
suggest that $10bn was the size at which
this would be justified, but we have
based our decision on our belief that
as a result of superior investment
performance our FUM will continue to
grow. Obviously if we are correct, this
will further reduce the earlier referenced
cost/income ratio.
The financial services industry
We are continuing to watch the
significant reduction in market
capitalisation that is being suffered
by many financial service companies.

Chief Executive Officer’s review
Continued
Many of these have grown very rapidly
in the past into areas that they did not
understand, with inadequate systems and
risk controls in place. In many instances
the pay and other rewards received
by many practitioners would seem to
be out of all proportion to their expertise
or experience. Further the shareholders
who own these businesses do not seem
to have done very well from these events
either. Even now it seems amazing that
many bonuses remain so high when
businesses are losing money. At some
point there has to be a realisation that in
many instances these have been flawed
business models, that shareholders, the
owners, do need to make money, and
that a balance of reward between the
various stakeholders rather than greed
is what this business is all about.
I would point out that the formula that
we employ within CLIG is that the
Employee bonus pool is 30% of the
pre tax, pre bonus profit. Shareholders
receive the balance of the earnings
subject to cover for the dividend being
around 1.5 times. Our established policy
is to pay this dividend approximately one
third as an interim and the other two
thirds as a final dividend.
We believe that our clients pay the bills
and our shareholders own the business.
We believe that we are charged with the
role of managing that business.
A new board member
Recently, Allan Bufferd joined the Board
of CLIG. We were introduced to Allan via
his role as T reasurer of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, where he worked
for 34 years. As a result of Allan’s arrival
we now have some experienced US
Institutional Fund Management expertise
on our Board which I believe will assist
us regarding making good strategic
decisions regarding the Group over the
next few years.
Currency hedging and sensitivity
to our US$ exposure
There are two pieces of information that
I would reference in this Statement that
appear elsewhere in this report. First our
currency hedging programme, and second
the sensitivity of our GBP denominated
income to (primarily USD denominated)
fee income. These are described on pages
15 and 45. Obviously, USD/GBP currency
sensitivity is particularly relevant at this
time of significant volatility in currencies.
My retirement
Rather than there be any misunderstanding
regarding my potential retirement
I thought it might be helpful to go
into some detail regarding my present
intentions. Obviously I have zero ability
to impose my will on either Shareholders
or the Group Board, but ideally and
taking into account the previous caveat,
it would be my intention to continue
to work for at least another five years.
Since I reached the age of sixty, three
years ago, I have repeated this each year
I would like to thank
CLIG employees for their
continued hard work in
what has been a difficult
market environment.
The relative success
enjoyed by the Group
is entirely down to your
hard work.

and would intend to continue to repeat
it in this Statement each year for as long
as the plan was unchanged. I would
however like to make the point that I do
need to start planning for retirement.
To this end it is my present intention to
offer an option for 1m of my CLIG
shares to the CLIG ESOP at a price of,
say, 300p for these shares to be
distributed via the ESOP according to the
rules of the ESOP . Further, separate from
any ESOP transaction, in the event that
the CLIG share price appreciates to 400p
during the next year it would be my
intention, subject to relevant Close Period
restrictions, to sell a further 500,000
shares and to undertake the same at
450p and 500p.
I’m stating this in this review because
many founder employee shareholders
such as myself, come in for a significant
amount of criticism as a result of these
types of transaction. It’s my opinion that
if this is communicated well in advance
of the event, that any criticism would be
unjustified. This should also be seen
within the context of my own personal
financial circumstances. Effectively all
of my wealth is tied up in CLIG shares,
and whilst I have no present intention
of retiring I would like to have the
opportunity for planning for such an
event at some point in the future.
Dubai office
We opened our Dubai office last
November. This office was established
to enable us to continue to develop our
investment process. We were of the opinion
in establishing the office there were going
to be some major investment opportunities
in the region over the next few years. Prior
to the opening of the office we had decided
to overweight the region in our emerging
market portfolios. Subsequent to opening
the office we have further increased our
weighting to the region. This over
weighting is one of the major reasons
for the out performance we have achieved
in comparison to our benchmarks over
the past year.
Continued growth
If one were to index our FUM from the
high of the Index (MXEF 1,340 at the
end October ‘07) our FUM should have
been around $3.17bn at yesterday’s
recent low of 840. Instead, FUM were
$3.52bn, representing both the effects of
our relative out-performance versus the
Index as well as net positive subscription
activity from our clients. Looking
forward to the fourth calendar quarter,
we have at this juncture commitments
for another $325 million in the pipeline
(see Asset Flows chart on page 9).
CLIG employees
I would like to thank CLIG employees
for their continued hard work in what
has been a difficult market environment.
The relative success enjoyed by the Group
is entirely down to your hard work.
I would like to say as a shareholder that
the overall team work displayed by you
all is something of which you should
be very proud.

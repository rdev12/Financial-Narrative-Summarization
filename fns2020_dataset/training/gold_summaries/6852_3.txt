Greene King plc Annual Report 2010
CHAiRmAn’s st AtEmEnt
Results
In another year of challenging conditions, we 
have once more delivered successful trading 
performances across our businesses. I am pleased 
to report that we have grown our revenue by 
3.1% to a record level of £984.1m. While our 
operating profit was 2.3% below last year at 
£211.3m*, our profit before tax and exceptional 
items was up 3.8% at £123.0m*. The earnings 
per share figure of 43.4p* is 18.7% below last 
year’s, principally because of the higher number 
of shares following the rights issue.
Dividend
Once again, our healthy cash generation has 
enabled the board to recommend a final dividend 
payment of 15.6p per share. This will take the 
total dividend for the year to 21.5p per share, 
2.4% ahead of the adjusted dividend per share 
for the period last year. The dividend cover of 
2.0x is in line with the board’s policy. The final 
dividend will be paid on 13 September 2010 to 
those shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on 13 August 2010.
Acquisitions 
During the year we took the opportunity to 
purchase three small packages of high quality 
pubs, situated in attractive locations in England 
and Scotland. Altogether, including single sites, 
we acquired 28 properties, all of which are 
freehold and being run under management, 
for a total consideration of £67.4m. We are 
very pleased with their trading performance 
post-acquisition. Since the year end, we have 
acquired a further six outlets for £7.9m. 
Disposals
We have also continued to dispose of our 
non-core assets. During the year, we sold 
105 properties for £27.2m, against a combined 
book value of £26.2m. 
Board
After serving on our board for eleven years as 
managing director of Pub Partners, David Elliott 
left us at the end of January. The size and scope 
of our tenanted and leased pub business grew 
significantly under his responsibility and I would 
like to express my thanks to him for the contribution 
he made to the company. 
T owards the end of the year the board took the 
decision to reduce its size. This was precipitated 
by the fact that we had two managing directors 
who were members of the board and three 
who were not and we wanted to achieve parity 
in the management structure. Justin Adams and 
Jonathan Lawson agreed to step down from the 
board at the end of April, but their responsibilities 
for Brewing Company and Local Pubs remain 
exactly as they were. 
People
I would like to thank everyone for the role they 
have played in achieving another successful year. 
More customers have frequented our pubs and 
restaurants and enjoyed our own-brewed ales 
than ever before and this is testament to the 
dedication and drive of our people. 
Specifically, I would like to thank the many 
thousands of Greene King employees who work 
across the country in our pubs and restaurants, 
playing a vital role in demonstrating high quality 
standards in the marketplace. They should feel 
proud of their efforts in helping us to trade 
successfully through two difficult years of 
economic recession.

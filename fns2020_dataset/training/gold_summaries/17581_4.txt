Our new real-time digital behaviour tracker
YouGov Pulse enables brands and agencies 
to capture real-time, in-depth and actual online 
consumer behaviour across laptops, smartphones 
and tablets. Pulse makes it possible to understand 
the full picture of what consumers do online and the 
online journeys they experience.
Quantitative and qualitative research directed by our sector specialists
Using their in-depth sector knowledge, our custom 
research specialists employ both quantitative and 
qualitative methods to identify and analyse markets, 
clarify opportunities and challenges and to generate 
data that provides clients with actionable information. 
Our highly structured and codified profile data library 
(known as the YouGov Cube) allows us to enhance 
our custom offering by minimising the additional 
data collection required to answer clients’ questions 
about the attitudes, behaviours and profiles of the 
population. Our expertise in combining custom 
research with syndicated data helps us to deliver a 
high degree of value for money to our clients.
Our key offerings include: reputation studies 
(measuring public and stakeholder opinion on 
an organisation’s reputation); syndicated studies 
covering sector or product trends, such as our 
YouGov/TIME Inc. Survey of Affluence and Wealth 
(US) and Insurance Industry Customer Satisfaction 
Monitor (Germany); and our full research 
programme providing a range of research, often 
on annual contracts, including tracking studies, 
qualitative research and customer profiling.
Comprehensive market intelligence reports
The YouGov Reports division consists of market 
intelligence reports (previously called SixthSense 
reports), the HEAT economic confidence tracking 
study and specialist syndicated financial, media 
and technology trackers.
Our daily brand perception tracker
YouGov’s flagship brand intelligence service, 
YouGov BrandIndex, tells our clients what the world 
thinks of their brands and their competitors at any 
given moment and helps our clients understand the 
link between their media and advertising efforts, 
brand perception, and consumer response.
Delivering next-day answers
The YouGov Omnibus is the perfect vehicle to find 
out, quickly and cost-effectively, people’s opinions, 
attitudes and behaviours. Omnibus surveys are run 
daily, providing nationally representative responses 
to clients within a 48 hour turnaround (only 24 hours 
in the UK).
Our new planning and segmentation tool
YouGov Profiles will improve the ability of marketers 
to understand the people and audiences that 
matter to them. It will enable media owners to 
identify potential advertisers and make more 
informed content and scheduling decisions so as to 
deliver the target audience that advertisers require.

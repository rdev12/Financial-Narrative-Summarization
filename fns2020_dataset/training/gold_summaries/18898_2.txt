The Board uses a range 
of Key Performance Indicators
(“KPIs”) to assess performance. 
These include strategic KPIs
which measure how we are
meeting our objectives and are
also used in determining
performance payments to 
the executive directors and
senior management team.
Financial KPIs measure the
overall performance of the
business and are aligned 
with those commonly used 
by shareholders. 
Non-financial KPIs also form 
a key part in monitoring our
strategic progress as well as
being of importance to our 
wider stakeholders.

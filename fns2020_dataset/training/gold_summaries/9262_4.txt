specific projects.

l amprell at a g lance
Lamprell has three facilities located in 
the UAE in the Arabian Gulf, one of 
the most important oil and gas 
regions in the world. 
Jebel Ali
Lamprell’s Jebel Ali facility was 
purpose built in 2002 and is one 
of the most modern in the region. 
It is located in the Jebel Ali Free 
Zone and is 25km from the  
centre of Dubai.
The facility occupies an area of 
178,900m² that includes more 
than 16,000m² of covered work 
spaces with internal overhead 
cranes suitable for carrying out 
fabrication and assembly 
activities under cover. 
The covered areas also contain 
the latest welding and CNC 
cutting machinery. This protected 
work environment is cooler, safer 
and more productive than an 
outside location, and it allows the 
production of a higher quality 
product at less cost. The yard 
was designed to allow optimum 
production based on a clear and 
logical flow of material through 
the facility. In addition to the 
covered fabrication areas it has 
extensive open fabrication areas 
that are equipped with gantry and 
mobile crawler cranes Saudi Arabia

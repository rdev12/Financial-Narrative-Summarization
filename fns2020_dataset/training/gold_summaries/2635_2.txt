The Nebit Dag PSA area is 
located onshore in western 
Turkmenistan and contains three 
producing oil fields operated by 
Burren: the original Burun field 
and two recently discovered 
fields, Balkan (still undergoing 
appraisal) and the small Uzboy 
field. The PSA term runs until 
2022, and may be extended  
for a further 10 years by mutual 
agreement. Burren has been the 
operator of the PSA since 2000.
 
Burun crude is a light high  
quality low sulphur crude with  
an API gravity of 33°. All of 
Burren’s entitlement production  
is delivered from the field to 
Turkmenneft under swap 
arrangements whereby we 
receive equivalent volumes  
at designated Caspian ports  
in Turkmenistan. These volumes 
are sold on an FOB basis.

Burren has interests in three 
blocks, East Kanayis (onshore 
western desert), North Hurghada

The Kouilou and Noumbi licences 
together cover an onshore area of 
over 4,000 km
2
, stretching along 
the entire Atlantic coast of Congo. 
The Kouilou licence area contains 
two producing fields: M’Boundi 
and the much smaller Kouakouala 
field. The operator in each case  
is Maurel & Prom, the French 
independent E&P group. 
The fields are connected by 
pipelines to an export terminal 
operated by Total and Eni at 
Djeno on the Atlantic coast,  
a distance from M’Boundi of 
about 40 km, where the crude  
is incorporated in the N’Kossa 
export blend, a very light low-
sulphur crude with an API gravity 
of around 38°.

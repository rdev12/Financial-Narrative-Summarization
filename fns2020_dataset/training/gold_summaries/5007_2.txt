AT A GLANCE
OUR 
VISION
is to become the 
leader in recycled 
packaging for 
consumer goods.
WHO WE ARE
Our story can be traced back to the hand-made rigid box making business 
started in 1940 by the Smith brothers in East London. Since then, the 
company has grown continuously, through a series of acquisitions including 
St Regis (now DS Smith Paper) in 1986 and Kaysersberg (now DS Smith 
Kaysersberg) in 1991. DS Smith originally listed on the London Stock 
Exchange in 1960. We are a leading provider of corrugated packaging in 
Europe and are present in 25 countries employing around 20,000 people.

BUSINESS MODEL BALANCE OF OUR BUSINESS
CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Our business model is designed to deliver, consistently, 
a return on capital above our cost of capital. 
We have built a resilient and sustainable business model where our 
long position in corrugated packaging and the collection of ﬁbres 
through recycling, and our short position in paper manufacturing, 
help to insulate us from the volatility of the paper cycle. We operate 
through our closed loop recycling model which is also an important 
differentiator as consumer goods companies and retailers seek to 
fulﬁl their environmental commitments.

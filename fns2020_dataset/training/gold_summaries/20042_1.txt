Chief Executive Officer’s review 
We are pleased to report a solid performance in 2014 against the backdrop 
of falling gold prices. We have taken significant steps forward this year in 
planning and development in relation to the efficient exploitation of the 
higher grade underground reserves at Sekisovskoye, which is a key factor  
in delivering significant shareholder value in the future.
During 2014, our operational performance at 
Sekisovskoye was robust and, importantly, the proportion 
of ore from the underground mine increased, as did the 
grade of ore mined from the underground operations. 
This bodes well as we continue with the transition 
from open-pit to a solely underground gold mine. In 
this regard, our technical consultants, Venmyn Deloitte, 
completed our Sekisovskoye Competent Persons Report 
(CPR). This comprised JORC compliant reserves and 
resources, financial assumptions and valuation scenarios 
for our development project. We also made positive 
progress in receiving permits for the Karasuyskoye Ore 
Fields and in 2015, we announced that we had been 
successful in receiving permits for further testing which 
will lead to a subsoil user licence in the near future.
Sekisovskoye gold mine – our operational track record 
The operational performance of the Company’s 
Sekisovskoye gold mine during 2014 against the prior 
year and against budget is provided below. The key 
operational statistics of the mine operation are shown in 
the ‘Mining – Open-pit’ table. In 2014, 25.3% of the total 
of 30,857oz of contained gold in the ore was mined from 
the underground operation. The average gold grade from 
the underground mine during 2014 was 2.96g/t, which is 
expected to rise as higher grade ore is accessed through 
continued underground development. The higher 
percentage of underground ore helped to increase the 
average grade from 1.61g/t in 2013 to 1.71g/t in the 
current year. Recovery fell from 84.3% in 2013 to 83.3% 
in 2014. However, it is expected to improve as the higher 
grade ore is processed, and is budgeted to be in the 
region of 84%.
The Sekisovskoye JORC probable reserve gold grade, 
as reported in the Competent Persons Report released 
to the market on 17 November 2014, is 4.09g/t. The 
Company is increasing the mined grade towards the 
reserve grade. At present, the mining operations are 
gradually moving towards the main ore body from  
the lower grade peripheral ore.
During the year the Company increased the number 
of employees working in the underground mine, and 
additional mining equipment was purchased to increase 
the future contributions of ore production from the 
underground mine. This is expected to provide a greater 
contribution as the scale of operation is expanded.
During the period, a preliminary review of the gold 
processing plant was conducted that highlighted 
opportunities to improve the performance of the plant, 
and detailed investigations will be initiated to determine 
how these may be implemented.

Sekisovskoye Independent Competent Persons 
Report – laying the foundations for our underground 
development plans
In Q4 2013, mining consultants Venmyn Deloitte 
commenced work on a Competent Persons Report (CPR) 
which was to estimate JORC compliant resources and 
reserves for Sekisovskoye, as well as providing cost and 
valuation scenarios for the underground development 
project. This work was completed in Q4 2014 and 
has enabled us to set out our future plans for this 
development project.
The Company has used the information obtained 
in the CPR to develop its plans in relation to the 
expansion of underground operations at Sekisovskoye. 
At present, it is exploring two options in relation to the 
development of the underground mine. These are (a) a 
shaft based approach as documented in the CPR and 
(b) a development based approach with the expansion 
of the existing decline and a secondary decline being 
strategically built to significantly increase the quantity 
of ore mined in an economically efficient way. Both 
approaches are expected to result in a similar net 
present value of future cash flows. However, the essential 
difference will be in the timings of cash flows needed  
to fund the capital expenditure. Underground gold 
mining particularly in Australia has advanced in the 
use of the decline approach which is popular with a 
large number of mining companies. In this regard, the 
Company is in discussions with an international contract 
mine firm with extensive experience in the industry  
in relation to costings and assistance in developing  
a mining plan to assess the feasibility of developing  
the underground mine using this approach.
The CPR estimated probable ore reserves of 2.26Moz from 
17.25Mt at 4.09g/t Au from surface (approximately 350m 
above sea level) to 400m below sea level. The previous 
ore reserve estimate in 2011 was 0.27Moz of gold.
Mineral resources (both indicated and inferred) now total 
5.14Moz – an increase from 1.80Moz in 2011. Additional 
exploration results of 3.30Moz were also identified 
which, with further drilling, may be upgraded to mineral 
resources. These resource and exploration result estimates 
were based on an extensive drilling programme, which 
represented more than 170,000m of drilling.
Increasing future gold production
The current Sekisovskoye Mine has a conventional 
carbon-in-leach (CIL) gold recovery plant with a 
processing capacity of 0.85Mt pa. A small incremental 
processing plant expansion is planned to be completed 
by 2018, which will increase throughput from 0.85Mt 
pa to 1Mt pa. The expansion will be through de-
bottlenecking of existing equipment and the addition of 
some new equipment to support the upgrade.
Through accessing the higher grade ore reserves in 
the underground mine, which are estimated at 4.09g/t, 
against the 2014 average grade delivered to the mill  
of 1.81g/t Au, utilising the full processing plant capacity 
and incrementally increasing it, the Company is well 
placed to increase its annual gold production in excess  
of 100,000oz by 2018 under the current plans.
From 2015 onwards, the processing plant is expected 
to produce a gold dore with an overall gold recovery 
of 84% and an associated silver recovery of 75%. This is 
commensurate with the metallurgical test work that has 
been undertaken and is broadly in line with operational 
performance to date. Over the life of the mine, this is 
currently expected to produce 1.89Moz of gold with total 
associated silver production of 2.72Moz.
The CPR financial outcomes based on the JORC 
compliant Probable Reserve, the initial capital investment 
and forecast operating costs indicate a robust project for  
the underground mine development at Sekisovskoye.  
The Net Present Value (after tax), using a discount rate  
of 9.3% and a prevailing gold price at that time of 
US$1273/oz was estimated at US$286.7m with a 64.4% 
IRR. Additional financial modelling has confirmed 
the project remains viable at gold prices which are 
significantly below current prices, as demonstrated in  
the following table. Importantly, this table demonstrates 
that the project remains Net Present Value positive under 
low gold price scenarios.
The upside opportunity at the Sekisovskoye Mine is 
related to further exploration drilling to upgrade the 
existing multimillion ounce gold exploration targets to 
Mineral Resources and to potentially upgrade the existing 
Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves. This may justify  
a further expansion of the processing plant or increase 
the mine life. The option of a feasibility study for a 2Mt pa 
mine in the future, producing more than 200,000oz per 
year of gold is being considered, based on the increase  
in the overall resource and the large volume of 
prospective exploration targets identified.

Karasuyskoye – our long-term development plan
In 2013, GoldBridges reported that it had acquired  
a very extensive technical database that covered  
the Karasuyskoye Ore Fields area, a land package  
of 198km
2
, adjacent to Sekisovskoye. 
We are pleased to report that during 2014 we made 
significant progress in terms of obtaining drilling permits 
for Karasuyskoye and in January 2015, were given further 
rights to perform confirmatory drilling. This is expected to 
lead to the award of a licence and contract for the subsoil 
rights by the relevant authorities in Kazakhstan.
The final subsoil licence terms and conditions, including 
the new financial incentives now offered specifically to 
the Company through the state programme on forced 
industrial-innovative development (SFIID), are expected 
to be finalised in the near term. These additional terms 
are expected to include investment incentives and tax 
reductions as previously announced.
The data acquired indicates that there are several 
mineralised zones and leads the Company to believe  
that Karasuyskoye has the potential to contain significant 
gold resources. The Company is to commence validation 
work of this geological data. This work will facilitate the 
preparation of an independent Competent Persons 
Report (CPR) to international standards, and the Company 
will work on this programme throughout 2015 and 2016.
On completion of the CPR, the Company envisages 
progressing towards mining within the Karasuyskoye 
Ore Fields, primarily using cash generated from existing 
operations. There is also the potential to use the 
Company’s existing open-pit assets once Karasuyskoye 
becomes operational.
Move to Main Market
In December 2014, we moved our listing from AIM  
to the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange  
with a Standard Listing. The progression to the Main 
Market is a natural step in the Company’s growth cycle  
as a quality Kazakh company, and shows our alignment  
with and commitment to the London Investor base.  
The move also reflects our focus on meeting best  
practise corporate governance standards.
Financial performance 
The financial performance of the Company is detailed  
on page 07.
Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks of the Company are detailed on  
pages 08 and 09.
Key performance indicators
The key performance indicators used to monitor  
the performance of the Company are outlined in  
the financial performance on page 07. 
The Company sets out a budget and mining plan 
incorporating the key mining statistics to be achieved 
and these are monitored on a daily, weekly and monthly 
basis, with any discrepancies from budget investigated  
on a timely basis.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation (EBITDA), 2014: US$5.3m  
(2013: negative US$589,000).
EBITDA is a measure of the cash that the Company 
generates in the year, and is adjusted to exclude 
exceptional items to make it more meaningful and 
comparable on a year on year basis.
In the opinion of the Directors these are the key measures 
by which the Company can best measure its performance 
internally and against other gold producers.
Corporate social responsibility
The corporate social responsibility performance of the 
Company is detailed on pages 10 and 11. 
Looking to 2015
2015 will be a busy year for the Company as it plans to 
make significant progress to lay the foundations for its 
growth. The Company is close to finalising its approach 
in relation to the funding, and the technical approach 
to be taken to develop the mine and shareholders will 
be updated in due course. Given the robust economics 
of the project the Company is positive of remaining 
profitable against an uncertain future gold price.
The Company is very positive about the future potential 
of the Karasuyskoye project and will be progressing this 
asset in parallel to Sekisovskoye. The Company will keep 
shareholders informed of the exploration and appraisal 
progress on this asset during the course of the year.

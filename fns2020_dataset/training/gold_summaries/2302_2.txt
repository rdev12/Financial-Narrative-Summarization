Post-exceptional adjusted basic earnings per share
The change in share capital structure in 2013 has a profound effect on the calculation of the weighted average number of shares in issue, which is used to calculate basic 
earnings per share. In order to allow more meaningful comparison with previous years, we have only shown on this page post-exceptional adjusted basic earnings per share. 
The adjustment restates the weighted average number of shares in issue as if the total shares issued post-IPO were in issue throughout the whole year, and for the whole of 
FY13. Details of basic earnings per share can be found on page 52.

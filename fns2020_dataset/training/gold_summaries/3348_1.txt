 6 Charter plc Annual Report 2006
Chief Executive’s statement
ESAB and Howden are both market
leaders in their chosen fields, whose
technological strengths and
heritage are recognised by their
customers. Both businesses benefit
from their brand strengths which
have enabled them to deliver
customer benefitswhicharereflected
in the margin improvements that
they have achieved.
Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to be able to present to you another excellent set
of results in my first report as Chief Executive. Building upon the
restructuring efforts of recent years, both of Charter’s businesses,
ESAB and Howden, have made the most of opportunities
presented by strong markets. In 2006, volume growth has been
significant in both businesses, and further progress has been made
in improving margins.
Business development
Both businesses are committed to further improvement and have
significant development opportunities. ESAB has achieved volume
growth in 2006 and, in many consumables markets, capacity
utilisation is already close to being maximised. To respond to this,
and in recognition of the development of the customer base in
emerging markets (especially China, the remainder of Asia and
Eastern Europe, including Russia), ESAB has committed to expand
its consumable production capacity by some 20 per cent between
June 2006 and June 2007. The opening of the consumables
factory near Shanghai, new flux capacity in Eastern Europe and
other measures currently underway mean that the achievement
of this objective is now in sight. Continued market strength,
and the growth of new industrial markets, indicate that further
increases in capacity will be required. Financial performance
is being increasingly underpinned by operational improvements,
as progress is made in lean manufacturing, supply chain
development and investment in lower cost economies. In North
America, the business weathered a strike at its main production
facility in Hanover, Pennsylvania. Following the strike, productivity
has improved and production levels are recovering.
As for Howden, the order book grew strongly during the first half
of 2006. Whilst the value of outstanding orders accounted for
by customers in China has reduced as power plant production
slows to return to the trend rate of growth of the Chinese
economy as a whole, new opportunities in Europe and North
America have enabled the order book to remain strong in the
second half of the year. Order intake in the first two months
of 2007 has been strong. As with most capital goods businesses,
the aftermarket represents a major opportunity. After a year of
consolidation in which low margin service work was eliminated,
aftermarket growth is expected to continue with strong margins,
with the Chinese aftermarket representing a significant

ESAB achieved sales of £828.4 million (2005: £720.1 million), an
increase of 15 per cent, operating profits of £98.9 million (2005:

Howden sales totalled £429.5 million (2005: £345.1 million), an
increase of 24 per cent, operating profits were £49.3 million, before
taking into account profit on the sale of property of £4.8 million,
(2005: £33.5 million), an increase of 47 per cent, and operating
margins increased to 11.5 per cent as compared with 9.7 per cent

opportunity. Howden is also in the process of introducing new
products into China. Geographically, we see opportunities from
the expansion of Howden’s business in South America and are
taking steps to ensure we are active in the potentially significant
Indian and Russian markets. We are pleased to have acquired
the outstanding shares in Howden Compressors, which will
enable us to re-focus this business and in turn this will support
our efforts to expand in the important petrochemical market.
Operating efficiencies have improved as volume growth has
been supported almost entirely by increased sub-contracting
activity rather than in-house manufacture. Continuous product
development and improvements in execution and application
engineering continue to enable Howden to stand out as the
leading business in its field.
The last few years have resulted in the creation of a culture
in Charter where performance is kept continuously in focus.
In relation to ESAB and Howden, the principal key performance
indicators monitored by the Board relate to growth in revenue
and operating profit and changes in operating margin. At the

Charter level, the Board focuses on growth in earnings per share
and cash generation.
The table sets out the financial key performance indicators in use
during the year and the outcomes for 2006 against those for 2005.
In relation to each indicator, the outcome for the year is considered
against the outcome for the previous year and budget, taking into
account internal and external factors and any unusual or non-
recurring items, which might otherwise have a distorting effect
on the outcome.
It is recognised that financial performance is not sufficient on
its own and non-financial key performance indicators are being
progressively rolled out. These include health and safety and
environmental measures which are monitored and measured
with robust plans in place to continuously improve performance.
These matters, together with risk management and business
continuity planning, receive regular focus both from management
and the Board. In addition to the economic risks and competitive
pressures which Charter’s businesses continuously face and
manage, Charter has faced significant litigation which continues
to be addressed as referred to in the Chairman’s statement and
more fully described elsewhere.
Charter will remain focussed on its two core businesses,
both of which are capable of further significant development.
The welding and cutting markets should grow in line with global
economic activity and increasing steel consumption. This remains
a fragmented industry and it is likely that further consolidation
will take place in the coming years. Charter intends that ESAB
will remain at the forefront of the industry and will play a part
in this trend provided always that any acquisitions provide the
opportunity to increase shareholder value. The continued and
growing needs of the power market and ongoing pressures
for environmental improvement will continue to provide Howden
with the scope for further development.
Robust industrial markets and the need to improve power
infrastructure mean that both businesses continue to benefit from
good market conditions, and are well placed to make further progress
as their plans for development are progressively implemented.

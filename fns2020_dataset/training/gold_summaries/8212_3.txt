 Executive Chairman’s statement
Overview
I was very pleased with the
performance of the Group during the
past 12 months as we made
significant strides towards our goal
of becoming the leading IT
infrastructure provider in Europe
while also growing our revenues and
reducing our losses. Our Managed
Services division has also enjoyed an
acceleration in the cumulative value
of contracts won which at 31 March
2004 was £60m (2003: £40m),
generating £18.0m (2003: £10.5m) 
of recurring revenue per annum 
once commissioned. 
We have significantly altered the mix
of business within our Specialist
Distribution division this year by both
organic growth and acquisition so
that higher margin software,
consultancy and maintenance sales
now represent some 31% (2003:
17%) of our distribution revenues.
The acquisition of Allasso on 31 July
2003 has enabled us to extend our
specialist distribution model to
include IT security products and build
a platform for territorial growth in
five other western European markets. 
Our unique expertise across storage,
security and enterprise software
combined with our ability to deliver
utility-based computing services is
beginning to pay real dividends. As
computing moves inexorably towards
a more networked environment we
are finding that our customers are
looking increasingly for a one-stop IT
infrastructure supplier such as
InTechnology. In this current financial
year we will be taking steps to
significantly increase the levels of
cross-selling to our customer base as
well as unifying key group functions,
which will lead to a much more
effective and efficient operation.
Trading and operating
performance
There was a very strong sales
performance from the Specialist
Distribution division in the second
half of the year which contrasted
with a slow start in the first half. The
Allasso software security products
division performed in line with
expectations and is now fully
integrated into InTechnology.
Managed Services achieved a strong
and consistent level of new contract
wins in each half year. 
Group turnover was £223.5m during
the year (2003: £156.9m) and gross
profit improved by 75% to £40.8m
(2003: £23.3m). Net operating
expenses before depreciation,
amortisation of goodwill and
exceptional items were £33.5m
(2003: £19.3m) with the acquisition
of Allasso accounting for £10.5m of
the increase. Net operating expenses
were £43.6m (2003: £29.8m).
Earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation, amortisation of
goodwill and exceptional items
increased to £7.3m (2003: £3.9m).
Group operating profit before
amortisation of goodwill was £1.6m
(2003: £2.6m loss). The Group
reported an operating loss of £2.8m
(2003: £6.6m loss).
InTechnology’s balance sheet remains
strong with cash of £16.4m (2003:
£18.2m) and net debt after finance
leases and term loans of £10.4m
(2003: net funds £10.0m) largely as a
result of the acquisition of Allasso.
Specialist Distribution division
InTechnology’s Specialist Distribution
activities embrace three principal
areas of expertise: Storage, Security
and Enterprise Software. In the UK we
are engaged in all three activities; in
continental Europe revenues are, for
now, almost exclusively derived from
security software and appliances. 
The slow start to the year experienced
by Specialist Distribution was put
firmly behind us during the second
half of the year when we produced
some excellent results, which included
a record third quarter. Despite the
well-documented commercial and
market difficulties experienced by all
partners of Sun and HP in the first
half of the year we managed to retain
our market position, while our IBM
business has continued to expand. 
We were also encouraged by the
performance of our Veritas software
business and made a promising start
in our new UK relationship with
Network Appliance. The storage
market continues to grow in both
volume and complexity and we are
confident that we are, as always, 
well positioned to maximise this
opportunity.
We have now fully integrated the 
UK operation of Allasso into an
enlarged UK Specialist Distribution
business although maintaining the
Allasso brand.
Allasso’s continental European
footprint presents a foundation on
which we can begin to build software,
storage, network and managed
services sales to the IT channel. In this
current financial year we are exploring
the opportunity to sell InTechnology's
storage software product portfolio
through our European offices, as we
believe this to be a strong growth area
for the business.
3 In the year UK Specialist Distribution
achieved revenues of £172.4m (2003:
£148.7m) and maintained operating
margins before amortisation of
goodwill of 5%. Operating margins
after amortisation of goodwill were
maintained at 4%. The division earned
an operating profit before
amortisation of goodwill of £8.5m
(2003: £8.1m) and an operating profit
of £6.5m (2003: £6.4m). Software,
consultancy and maintenance
revenues were 30% (2003: 17%) of
the division’s revenue.
Allasso Europe recorded revenues of
£36.6m and an operating profit of
£0.8m. There was encouraging
revenue growth in southern Europe
and we see good potential to exploit
our new European footprint.
Managed Services division
Managed Services increased revenues
by 77% to £14.5m (2003: £8.2m) with
an operating loss before amortisation
of goodwill and exceptional items of
£7.8m (2003: £9.1m) which reflects
our continued ongoing investment in
this side of the business and the time
delay between winning and
commissioning contracts. The
Managed Services operating loss was
£10.0m (2003: £13.0m).
At 31 March 2004, our annualised
recurring revenues were £18.0m
(2003: £10.5m) and cumulative
contracts won were £60m (2003:
£40m). The Board remains confident
that following the installation of
approximately £65m of cumulative
contract wins, this division will
achieve EBITA breakeven.
I strongly believe that our technology
and methodology has gained
significant market awareness and
acceptance in both the UK public and
private sectors, where we have
achieved equal success. The
restorable data we now manage in
our data centres exceeds 2 petabytes
(2003: 0.7 petabytes) and we now
take data from over 170 customer
sites in the UK. Our network in the
UK, LANnet, has been a tremendous
success and we now have 168 sites
connected to the network taking a
variety of services from us. This year
we are also very encouraged that
55% of our user base now takes
more than one service from us and
10% now take three.
In October of last year we launched
our InPartnership programme,
through which we have formalised
many of our relationships with
consultants, integrators and
outsourcers which sell our services to
their clients. Sales of outsourced
services through this channel have
proved to be extremely effective as
we enable our partners to capture
more of their own clients’ recurring
IT spend without them having to
invest in data centres and network
infrastructure or work with a
competing IT provider. Many more of
our traditional channel partners are
turning to us for these services
which confirms our belief in the
unified InTechnology approach to 
the IT channel. 
As computing moves inexorably towards 
a more networked environment we are
finding that our customers are looking
increasingly for a one-stop IT infrastructure
supplier such as InTechnology.

New developments
We have a number of exciting new
developments across the Group in
the coming year:
InTechnology Appliances 
As the world of enterprise computing
becomes ever more complex we are
developing a range of appliances to
solve particular business and
legislative issues. Today a computing
solution can involve technologies
from many different suppliers
confusing both end users and even
the salesmen. InTechnology
Appliances, which we will launch
under the MyAppliance brand, aim to
remove all this difficulty and simplify
the whole process by defining a
solution to a specific problem and
supplying a turnkey package. 
Network products
InTechnology’s expertise has been
centred on storage and security
related products. Later this financial
year we look forward to significantly
expanding the product range by
adding some leading network
products.
Additional managed services
We are continuing to develop
commercially a number of
technologies in the Managed Services
division to improve performance,
reduce costs and broaden the range
of services offered to customers. In
the coming months we expect to
launch the following: 
• An increased capacity VBAK from
2TB to 4TB per system
• InTechnology Voice over IP (‘VOIP’)
• Archiving/Information Life-cycle
Management (‘ILM’)
• An enhanced data replication
offering.
Current trading
The first two months’ trading of this
financial year have been in line with
management expectations and are
ahead of the same period last year.
Outlook
As computing moves inexorably
towards a more networked
environment our customers are
increasingly turning to us either for
the supply of infrastructure,
products, services and expertise or
choosing to outsource to us the
provision of network, hosting or
storage services to improve the
overall resilience, compliance or
performance of their IT
infrastructure. 
In order to take advantage of our
excellent position as the one-stop IT
infrastructure provider to the
channel (systems integrators,
consultants and resellers) we shall
this fiscal year start integrating our
UK sales, marketing and professional
services divisions into a unified
structure. This will allow us to
achieve better customer focus with
all our products and services and
create greater operating efficiencies. 
The new products and services
outlined above will be launched this
year with the main financial benefits
arising from 2006 onwards.
We believe that the advent of
Network Computing is not only
about to happen, it is happening and
InTechnology is extremely well placed
to capitalise on this opportunity.

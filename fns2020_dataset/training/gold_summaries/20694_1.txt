 Banking as it should be
The key drivers of our performance 
in 2016 are rooted in our purpose. 
Since the Bank was founded in 2009, 
we have sought to challenge the status 
quo and empower more people across 
Britain to seek and seize opportunities 
in their professional and personal lives 
by providing ‘banking as it should be’. 
In doing so, we are addressing a market 
opportunity that is as real today as 
it was in the aftermath of the global 
financial crisis. In fact, as the market 
has matured, companies and individuals 
have increasingly recognised that a 
different kind of banking experience is 
both possible and available.
As a specialist bank, we don’t compete 
head on with the traditional banks in 
their main markets. We go beyond 
their one-size fits all approach by 
employing specialist underwriters 
to understand each individual, and 
by making sure we offer a service 
that works for them. We operate in 
carefully selected segments where 
we have the necessary experience 
and expertise to deliver strong and 
sustainable risk-adjusted returns 
through responsible lending. We benefit 
from a modern infrastructure and 
an efficient distribution model, using 
an approved network of specialist 
intermediaries and, increasingly, direct 
relationships with customers online or 
by telephone, without the need for a 
costly branch network.
A record year
It is with great pride that we are 
reporting another record year for 
Aldermore, demonstrating continued 
progress on the journey we described 
at IPO. I am particularly pleased that 
we were able to deliver such a strong 
performance despite the uncertainty 
presented by the UK’s referendum on 
EU membership. While the full political 
and economic implications of this 
2016 was another great year for 
Aldermore, with more customers 
than ever choosing us to serve their 
needs and profitability at record highs. 
As we move forward on our journey, 
I am confident that we can continue to 
build on this momentum, helping more 
customers to seize opportunities.”

Chief Executive Officer

Strategic report
Chief Executive Officer’s 
review decision are as yet unknown, the UK 
economy has remained resilient to date, 
and we continue to closely monitor our 
operating environment for any change.
Throughout the year, the Group 
has performed well and customer 
confidence remained high. We ended 
the year with strong growth, a robust 
credit performance and a healthy 
pipeline, giving us confidence that we 
are well positioned for further success.
Continuing commitment 
to UK businesses, 
homeowners, landlords 
and savers
Net loans to customers increased by 
£1.3bn, or 22% to £7.5bn at the end of 
2016, driven by record levels of organic 
origination. This record performance 
was seen across both Business Finance 
and Mortgages, where, respectively, 
£1bn and £2bn of new customer loans 
were provided. 
In Business Finance, we focus in both 
the asset finance and invoice finance 
markets. In Asset Finance we have 
leveraged our efficient broker-led 
distribution model to build a market 
leading position in this channel. 
Our specialist underwriting advantage 
in transport, plant and machinery, and 
other areas of expertise, enabled us 
to grow net lending by 7% to £1.6bn 
during 2016.
Across our Mortgages franchise 
we grew lending by 24% to £5.7bn. 
This was led by our broad customer 
offering in Buy-to-Let (BTL) which 
enabled us to grow BTL lending by 
38% to £3.3bn. In SME Commercial 
Mortgages, where we have particular 
expertise in underwriting multi-let 
investment properties, lending grew 
by 12% to £930m. In our Residential 
Mortgages business we are committed 
to truly understanding our customers’ 
circumstances which, with our focus on 
creditworthy segments of the market, 
enabled us to grow lending by 7% to 
£1.5bn.
Loan growth continues to be primarily 
funded by our award-winning deposit 
franchise. The performance of our 
savings business is driven by our 
straightforward and transparent 
proposition and our promise, that 
savers get “great returns effortlessly”. 
Our dynamic online franchise enables 
customers to tailor products to their 
needs and our transparent approach 
means we don’t use teaser rates. 
This approach drove an increase in 
deposits of 16% to £6.7bn in 2016. 
Business customers provide both 
c30% of this balance and a high level 
of advocacy, with 97% of customers 
surveyed saying they would 
recommend Aldermore to others.
Profit before tax up by over 
a third
Reported profit before tax rose 36% 
to a record high of £129m, driven 
by continued benefits from our 
growing franchises, a healthy net 
interest margin of 3.5% and further 
improvement in operational leverage 
with the cost to income ratio falling to 
below 45%. Our management of risk 
remains robust as demonstrated in a 
cost of risk of just 0.23%, and less than 
0.5% of our loans by value being classed 
as non-performing.
Enhanced balance sheet 
strength and strong 
shareholder returns
2016 was also an important year in 
further strengthening our balance 
sheet. While our fully loaded CRD IV 
CET1 ratio reduced by 0.3% to 11.5% 
over 2016, we reached the point of 
capital self-sufficiency in the second 
half of the year when our ratio rose 
by 0.5%. This increase was driven by 
record levels of profitability and was in 
line with our guidance at IPO. We expect 
our CET1 capital ratio to continue rising 
in the coming years, as we deliver 
strong, sustainable earnings. 
Overall, the Group generated underlying 
earnings per share of 26.4p and an 
underlying return on equity of 18%, or 
20% prior to the impact of the 8% bank 
tax surcharge introduced in 2016.
Strengthening the team
The excellent progress seen in 2016 is 
the result of the experience and effort 
that everyone at Aldermore puts into 
supporting customers on a daily basis 
and for this I extend gratitude to all my 
colleagues across the Group.
During the year I was delighted to 
welcome three new members to the 
Executive team. Christine Palmer 
joined us as Chief Risk Officer, Dana 
Cuffe joined as Chief Operating 
Officer and Rob Divall joined as the 
Group HR Director. All of my new 
Executive colleagues have tremendous 
experience in their fields and it is a real 
testament to the business and the 
progress we have made that we can 
continue to attract such high calibre 
executives, who share our vision 
and can help successfully drive us 
forward. I also express my gratitude 
to our outgoing Executive team 
members Steve Barry, Vicki Harris, 
Ali Humphries and Paul Myers for all 
that they contributed during their time 
with Aldermore.
Strategic priorities
As we seek to further enhance the 
sustainability of returns, our strategic 
priorities will continue to be delivering 
further growth, increasing efficiency 
and maintaining our robust approach to 
risk management.

priorities and progress in 2016. Strategic objective Our progress in 2016
Customer-driven:
Helping more customers to seek 
and seize opportunities
We will continue helping more customers across 
Britain to seek and seize opportunities, whether 
that’s growing their business, buying their first 
home or securing a fair return on their savings. 
Our focus remains on serving diverse pools of 
customer demand and adjacent markets, where 
we can operate as an agile, service-focused 
specialist player in large markets, providing us with 
multiple levers for growth.

awards across all of our franchises, including ‘Leasing and Asset Finance Provider of the 
Year’ (NACFB), ‘Best Specialist Mortgage Lender’ (Your Mortgage) and ‘Best Business 
Savings Provider’ (Moneynet)
• Our market-leading breadth of offering in Buy-to-Let helped us support more landlords 
than ever, as we grew customer numbers by 25% to c20k, originating over £1.2bn of 
loans, despite the increased market complexity
• We continued to serve specialist segments of the residential mortgage market and 
invested in enhancing our propositions, including those for the self-employed and first 
time buyers
• We also invested in developing our retention strategy in Mortgages, providing greater 
choice and support for customers looking for their next product
Simply delivered:  
Developing our scalable,
effective and efficient
operating model
Aldermore benefits from modern, scalable 
systems and an efficient online broker-led 
distribution model, as opposed to a costly branch 
network. We continue to invest in key capabilities 
and technology, optimising our operating model 
to support the delivery of growth with enhanced 
levels of service, capability and efficiency.
• We generated greater operational leverage in the business, bringing the underlying cost 
to income ratio below 45%
• As well as introducing new Executives we also bolstered the wider teams during 2016, 
strengthening expertise across the Group including, a new Head of Enterprise Risk, Chief 
Information Officer and Chief Data Officer
• We progressed a number of improvement initiatives over the year, including enhanced 
digital capability, process simplification, platform upgrades and a refresh of our brand and 
customer segmentation
Securely managed:  
Maintaining a diverse and  
low-risk business model
As specialist underwriters, our ability to 
understand our customers’ circumstances and 
the value of underlying assets is a source of 
competitive advantage. Growth is supported and 
controlled by a consistent risk appetite and robust 
risk management framework, which drives our 
prudent approach across all areas of the Group.
• Our credit quality remained well within our appetite as we incurred a cost of risk of 23bps 
and maintained non-performing loans below 0.5% of our portfolio
• We continue to originate in line with centrally controlled underwriting standards, including 
stress testing affordability, before going on to re-score the portfolio on a monthly basis
• We made a number of enhancements to our credit risk models through our on-going 
work to become IFRS9 compliant ahead of the January 2018 implementation date

Strategic report – Chief Executive Officer’s review
Our strategy – supporting strong 
and sustainable returns Outlook for 2017 and beyond Key performance indicators
As we deliver on the first priority of our 
strategy, we expect to grow our loan book 
by between 10% and 15% in 2017 with further 
growth thereafter and the portfolio mix 
remaining broadly stable. The exact pace of 
growth will be dependent on our ability to 
grow within our prudent risk appetite, while 
delivering strong and sustainable returns.
We will also continue to invest in efficiency, 
and enhanced operating leverage in order 
to deliver on our second strategic priority. 
This, combined with our planned growth, 
is consistent with the cost to income ratio 
declining below 40% over the medium term. 
In line with our third strategic priority, we will 
retain a prudent approach to risk across the 
bank over 2017 and beyond to support the 
sustainability of earnings
We are delighted with the Group’s 
performance in 2016 and remain positive on 
our outlook notwithstanding the economic 
uncertainty and potential changes to 
regulatory capital requirements. The Board will 
therefore continue to consider the payment of 
dividends while taking into account the growth 
opportunities available, anticipated changes 
in capital requirements, and once the Group’s 
CET 1 ratio is above 12%. 
In conclusion…
I’m delighted that our record performance 
in 2016 continues to demonstrate delivery 
against our business plan and targets 
and I would like to thank our customers, 
colleagues and shareholders for their 
continued support. 
We have clear strategic priorities to further 
create and unlock value across the business, 
as we continue to serve and delight our 
customers and generate strong and 
sustainable returns for our shareholders.

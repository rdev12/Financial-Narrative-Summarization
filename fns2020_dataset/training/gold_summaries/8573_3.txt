 Building new businesses 
and revenue streams
We have made real progress in:
• expanding the audience for our growing
television channels;
• building our production business 
and exploiting our content across 
all platforms and media; and
• developing new businesses and revenue
streams in pay and consumer areas.
Every part of the Group has contributed 
to this success.
In broadcasting we have seen tremendous
success for our new channels and growing
sponsorship and interactive revenues.
In production we have continued to grow
our UK sales to other broadcasters and we
are expanding our proﬁtable US and
Australian production businesses with
commissions for network broadcasters.
Our new consumer team has launched
a number of successful ventures in
2005, which will enable us to grow our
non-advertising revenues. In 2005 we
acquired SDN and Friends Reunited.
These acquisitions support our strategy;
with SDN providing long term digital
terrestrial transmission capacity and
already growing in value, and Friends
Reunited increasing customers for its
content based services and building
communities through cross promotion
from television. Organic growth is increasing
from our interactive revenues, with ITV Play
making a very promising start.
Chairman’s statement
16 ITV plc 2005 annual report
In ITV’s second year as a single Company
we have continued to build on last year’s
progress, further improving our structure
and our proﬁtability.
2005 results
After a good ﬁrst half our operating proﬁt
before amortisation and exceptional items
continued to grow in the second half of the
year, and for the full year is up by 42% on
last year to £460 million before exceptionals
and amortisation. Earnings per share
(before amortisation and exceptional items)
increased by 25% to 8.0 pence (up 54% to
5.4 pence after amortisation and
exceptional items).
Your Board is proposing a ﬁnal dividend of
1.8 pence per share payable on 3 July 2006
to shareholders on the register on
21 April 2006. The ex-dividend date will be
19 April 2006. This will increase the full year
dividend by 30% to 3.12 pence compared
to 2004, and will help achieve our stated
aim of rebalancing the levels of interim and
ﬁnal dividend over the medium term such
that the interim will ultimately represent
approximately one-third of the total
dividend.
Cash return to shareholders
In 2005 we reviewed the possibility of
returning cash to our shareholders and
concluded that before doing so we should:
• complete the process of renewing the
ﬁnancial terms of our ITV1 licences; and
• address the deﬁcit funding of our deﬁned
beneﬁt pension schemes.
We have now completed those processes
and have the capacity to return
£300 million to shareholders. We propose 
to do this over the coming few months by
way of market purchase of ordinary shares.
We are making real progress in:
• expanding the audience for our 
growing channels;
• building our production business 
and exploiting content; and
• developing new businesses and 
revenue streams.
  Regulation
We have made some signiﬁcant progress in
bringing regulation up to date; but we still
have a long way to go before we are as free
of regulation as our main competitors.
Our licence payments to the government
were reviewed in 2005 by our regulator,
Ofcom, and as a result were reduced from 
a pro forma ﬁgure of £207 million in 
2004 to £75 million in 2005. Over the
period to digital switchover they will
continue to reduce towards £4 million 
in constant prices.
Our Public Service Broadcasting (“PSB”)
obligations still cost nearly £250 million 
a year including programme costs and
revenue foregone during lower rating 
PSB programmes. Whilst we have recently
received some dispensation to reduce our
commitments to, for instance, the hours 
of religious and regional programming, 
we still have to bear costs which are both
disproportionate to the ratings achieved
from such material and almost unique 
to ITV as a commercial broadcaster. It is
essential that we are able to reduce these
PSB costs further over the medium term.
Contract Rights Renewal (“CRR”) is a 
further burden that has had the unintended
consequence of changing the way that 
our advertising market works. Our ITV1
advertisers now contract to deliver to us 
the share of broadcast expenditure
calculated under CRR and we therefore
have fewer opportunities to take advantage
of strengths in our schedule such as the
Football World Cup during 2006. We will
continue to lobby for CRR, which has
become a disproportionate remedy, to 
be relaxed as the share of the market that
ITV1 attracts is reduced by the growing 
multichannel universe. 
Corporate governance and CR
We are publishing a corporate responsibility
report for 2005 which sets out the detail of
our activities across the Group. ITV was the
highest contributor to charitable causes in
both the 2005 Guardian Giving List and
Business in the Community Percent Club,
ranking contributions to charitable causes
as a percentage of proﬁts of FTSE 100
companies. A large part of ITV’s giving 
is supplied as airtime across our family 
of channels.
Pension schemes
We are in a period of unprecedented
pressures on companies’ deﬁned beneﬁt
(“DB”) pension schemes.
Over recent years the factors to which
scheme deﬁcits have been exposed have
included increasing life expectancy of
members and falling world equity markets.
The most material factor now is the level 
of UK long term real interest rates where 
a small reduction can have a large impact
by increasing the net present value of a
scheme’s liabilities.
Our work on the DB pension schemes has
continued during 2005:
a) Scheme mergers
We have merged six DB schemes in the
Group into a single scheme with savings 
in cost and improved focus.
b) Deﬁcit funding and IAS 19 valuations
We have completed the £325 million of
deﬁcit funding that we announced in
September 2005, with the last tranche 
of £207 million paid early in 2006. Our IAS
19 aggregate deﬁcit has reduced during
2005 from £672 million to £532 million 
and the last £207 million reduces that 
to £325 million.
c) Tax simpliﬁcation
We have considered how we should deal
with aspects of the tax simpliﬁcation
regime coming into effect on 6 April 2006.
We will not separately compensate any
executives for this change, but will establish
alternate arrangements designed to leave
both individuals and the Group in a broadly
similar position.
Further details relating to the Group’s
pension schemes are given later in 
these accounts.
People
Henry Staunton will be stepping down from
the Board on 31 March 2006 after 13 years
as Finance Director, ﬁrst of Granada and
then of ITV. The Board would like to thank 
Henry for his contribution to the Company
and for his expertise in the mergers and
acquisitions that have formed it.
John Cresswell, our Chief Operating Ofﬁcer
since 2005, joined the Board in January and
is now our Finance Director. John has 
18 years of experience in operational and
ﬁnancial roles in television companies which 
will be of great assistance to us as we deal
with the many changes facing our industry.
I am pleased to welcome Mike Clasper, 
who joined the Board in January, as a
non-executive director. Mike has experience
in running service businesses, as well as in
advertising and marketing, that will be
valuable to us. David Chance stepped down
from the Board in February 2006. As his
involvement in other television ventures
has developed over recent months, he
decided that it was appropriate for him to
resign from the Board. We wish David well
with his future ventures.
Once again I would like to extend the
Board’s thanks to our management and
employees whose continued commitment
and drive make ITV the nation’s favourite
commercial broadcaster.

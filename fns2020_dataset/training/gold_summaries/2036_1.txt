 Overview
The gaming industry continues to move ever more rapidly, embracing the continually increasing
power of the Internet and technology. New ideas, products and methods of sports betting and
gaming arise regularly. Faced with such rapid change the retention of traditional risk management
processes has never been more vital. 
Several countries around the world are striving to put in place regulatory legislation and methods
of taxing and monitoring e-gaming activities. On behalf of your company, I have been involved in
campaigns to encourage governments to regulate the industry and participated actively in the “right
to wager” initiatives in the USA.
I am pleased that we are at the heart of this industry and well placed to assess and take advantage
of the most appropriate opportunities.
A recent significant prediction in Forbes.com stated that “over the next five years, as the gaming
generation ages into its 30s and 40s, expect revenues from traditional online entertainment (such
as games, gambling etc) to exceed those from offline entertainment (like movies, books and
casinos).”
This statement may sound like the heady dot.com days, but the difference is that the e-gaming
financial model is already secure. Furthermore your Group is experienced and well positioned,
following the flotation on AIM, to develop both organically and through acquisition.

Business review 
General
As reported to shareholders in November 2004 the results for the year under review were affected
adversely by an unusual run of NFL results and difficulties experienced in placing advertisements
for new customers.
The removal of certain advertising avenues, particularly in radio at the busiest period for acquiring
new customers (during the early part of the NFL season in September), was the major contributory
7
BETonSPORTS plc
Chief executive’s review factor to the reduction in new customer acquisitions. Acting immediately we decided not to spend
on unproven advertising avenues and consequently reduced our actual spend to $10.6m (2004
-$15.8m) against a forecast of $21.0m. We have now revised our advertising strategies and
developed new alternative advertising mediums which are more focused on the Internet. Early
performance indicators from our revised strategies are encouraging. 
The gross margin in the sportsbook was 5.4% (2004 -6.4 %) and was particularly hit by the
extraordinary run of wins in the regular NFL football season by:
• The New England Patriots (won 14 lost 2), and they also won the Super Bowl;
• Pittsburgh Steelers (won 15 lost 1); and
• Philadelphia Eagles (won 13 lost 3). 
In the 2003/4 season, only the New England Patriots achieved a comparable record.
Sportsbook
During the year, 71,750 (2004 -87,909) customers used our services placing 9.9m bets (2004
-11.5m) with an average bet size of $109 (2004 -$107), generating a monetary volume of
$1,090.3m (2004 -$1,241.8m).
The two main brands, BETonSPORTS and Millennium, together accounted for 81.3% (2004
-77.6%) of the total volume. 
Source: Company information
American football represented 39% (2004 -41%), basketball 36% (2004 -34%) and baseball 22%
(2004 -19%) of total volume. The lock out by owners of ice hockey teams resulted in the season
being cancelled and a loss of $25m in volume or about 2% of annual volume.
We continue to offer a dual betting platform, which allows our customers to place bets on the
phone or through the Internet. We believe strongly that the choice is important and telephone
contact improves our customer retention. Additionally it provides an extra level of control over bets
taken as well as flexibility. In the year, the number of bets placed using the telephone was 2.9m

telephone of $201 (2004 -$205) and through the internet of $72 (2004 -$71). To ensure effective
risk control all sports bets with stakes of over $2,500 must be placed by telephone. 
Customer retention is as important as gaining new customers. It is pleasing to note that over 30%
of our active customers have been with us for over 2 years and we continue to explore methods
of retaining loyalty.
The advertising restrictions severely dented our new customer acquisition plans with 31,557 (2004
-50,506) new customers registering and placing bets in the year. 
Casino
The number of customers who played in our online casino room in the year was 11,225 (2004
comparative not available). They placed 18.4 m (2004 -21.5m) bets at an average size of $18
(2004 -$19), which resulted in a monetary volume of $332.9m (2004 -$410.0m). 
Source: Company information
The number of sportsbook customers has a direct correlation to the number of players in our
casino room, and the lower casino volume reflects the reduction in sportsbook customers in the
year.
Our improved software and the larger variety of games increased our margin from 1.7% to 1.8%,
which provided a monetary gross margin of $5.9m (2004 -$6.8m).
We continue to pursue methods of improving our casino product and are planning an extensive
advertising campaign focusing on cross-selling to our existing and new customers in order to
promote greater participation. 
Poker
Our poker product was introduced into our BETonSPORTS brand on 8th October 2004 and was
subsequently offered to our Millennium customers in early December and our Infinity and
Wagermall brands in December. We decided to use a phased launch programme to offer our

BETonSPORTS plc
Chief executive’s review customers a choice but without obtaining revenues at the expense of sportsbook and casino
revenue streams.
The income is generated by charging a commission for hosting games (rake) and from tournament
fees. 
Source: Company information
We attracted 2,867 customers to our online poker and by the end of the year were averaging over
800 playing customers every week. Our volume per hand was approximately $8 with an average
of over 322,306 hands played per week. 
This generated income of $0.7m in the limited period from October 2004 to the year end.
Player liquidity is a key requirement for a poker room and we now have an active room with strong
controls to prevent collusion. 
Poker is currently riding the crest of the popularity wave and we are encouraging player growth,
but we are conscious of the need to continue to offer new and exciting opportunities to our
customers while maintaining our customers’ use of the sportsbook and casino offerings. We plan
to increase the poker offering to all brands within the Group, by the end of first half of 2005/06 and
to continue with a coordinated expansive marketing campaign to promote greater participation of
our poker offering.
Fee income
Our call centres in Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic have a capacity of 894 telephone
capture positions. While the majority deal with customer relations, we continue to develop other
business that requires call centre infrastructure and services such as market research and
telemarketing. 
We successfully increased this activity in the year, utilising spare capacity and in house skills to
generate income of $7.0m (2004 -$3.9m)
Marketing
We monitor closely the effectiveness of our marketing and advertising campaigns and dedicate
resources to brand awareness, customer retention and customer acquisition.

Chief executive’s review We employ a mixture of above and below the line techniques. During the year we spent $10.6m
(2004 -$15.8m), despite the difficulties we encountered in placing advertisements.
We also offer customers a range of incentives such as bonuses and free plays, to encourage
participation and stimulate use. These are monitored closely and require customers to bet the
value of bonuses a number of times before being able to withdraw winnings. In the year these
incentives amounted to $9.7m (2004 -$12.0m)
Source: Company information
Our advertising and marketing spend on customer acquisition is broken down into mailings 31.4%
(2004 -26.1%); magazines 19.1% (2004 -32.5%); radio 16.2% (2004 -24.8%); internet 9.5% (2004
-10.8%) and promotions 20.0% (2004 -5.7%) and TV 3.8% (2004 -nil).
The cost of each new customer was $336 (2004 -$313).
Operating costs
The total operating costs, excluding marketing, were contained at $39.7m (2004 -$35.6m) for the
year. Of this total, payroll related costs (including staff dedicated to fee income) amounted to
$19.8m (2004 -$17.1m), telecommunications cost $4.9m (2004 -$3.5m), payment processing
expenses were $4.2m (2004 -$2.3m) and property related costs were $2.0m (2004 -$1.7m).
We continue to explore more efficient working methods, seek more secure money processing
avenues and monitor the costs of our facility in the Dominican Republic which provides cover in
case our main data processing and call centre facility in Costa Rica suffers disruption. 
Payment processing
Effective payment processing is vital to the business, allowing customers to deposit funds easily
and to trust that winnings will be paid out with reliability. Certain US issuing banks have stopped
accepting online gambling transactions as a result of political pressure, but other suppliers, such
as NETeller are providing this service and filling any supply gap. New secure payment processing
avenues are researched continually and it is hoped that the increasing agreement by European
legislators that sportsbets from North America are acceptable, will increase the involvement of
major financial institutions in this market. We continue to monitor this area for fraud, money
laundering and risk.

Chief executive’s review Technology
Operational software forms an important aspect of the business and we have commissioned a full
specification of our requirements to:
• Enable the Group to offer a common wallet in any currency to our customers that allows them
to participate in any of our offerings from one source;
• Improve functionality; 
• Automate payment processing;
• Automate base level risk management;
• Provide the ability to personalise automatically the service to customers according to their
specific profile;
• Strengthen the safeguards to protect customers; and
• Better protect our systems against denial of service attacks by saboteurs.
The new platform will offer the ability to introduce further products and address the needs of the
next generation of users, including multi channel distribution systems such as mobile phones or
interactive TV. 
Latin American expansion
Our organic growth plans are centred around Central and South America because of our location
in that region and our knowledge of regional practices, regulations and customs. We embarked on
a proof of concept programme on 14th December 2004, where we started operating a joint venture
sportsbook in Guatemala which provides a virtual casino and sportsbook at a prominent spa hotel.
Business is building as an understanding and acceptance of sports betting improves and the
operation has helped our understanding of the issues involved in developing new territories in
Central and South America. 
On 21st February 2005, we signed a management supply contract to provide sportsbook facilities,
in up to 18 locations throughout Mexico, in association with a bingo operator.
The first location opened on 5th March in Mexico City and comprises a modern 562 seat bingo hall
with ancillary bar and restaurant facilities. We have installed a sportsbook area of 1800sq feet with
24 TV screens showing live sports and full sportsbook service lounge areas managed by
BETonSPORTS. Early indications are positive.
We are progressing on further initiatives in Peru and Argentina.
Strategic acquisitions
We are pursuing value enhancing acquisitions and have established our guidelines as
• Proven profitability;
• Strong local market presence and knowledge;
• Local regulatory compliance and trading licences with an assessment of exposure; 
12
BETonSPORTS plc
Chief executive’s review • IT integration and compatibility;
• Good financial control systems; and
• Effective risk management procedures.
The current overheated market has led to vendor price expectations being higher than true worth
and being conscious of this fact, we will only consider potential acquisitions which are strategically
important and earnings enhancing. 
We continue to seek opportunities in markets that will 
• Diversify our current business in terms of geographic location of customer base;
• Expand the range of sports events available to customers worldwide and spread the
seasonality bias of the current business;
• Create operational centres in key regions (Europe, Far East and Australasia);
• Increase the product range and services;
• Benefit from cross selling;
• Utilise the current infrastructure to save costs and grow businesses; and
• Increase the IT, marketing, risk management and financial capability.
Regulatory update
We welcome moves by Governments that clarify their regulatory legislation. However, we believe
that progress in this area around the World will continue to be slow and there will be little significant
movement within the next 12 months.
The UK Government’s Gambling Act is a move in the right direction, but there is still considerable
need for clarity on interpretations. At present the Act seems to suggest that a business registering
in the UK will be taxed on its activities in all jurisdictions. If this is correct the desire of the
Government that the UK becomes a major online gambling jurisdiction may not be fulfilled.
The success of Antigua against the USA in the WTO dispute is a triumph for logic and is good news
for the industry as a whole. Hopefully the decision will improve the environment for advertising and
cash transmission from the USA in particular.
Ultimately, we believe that the lure of tax revenues will provide a powerful argument for positive
legislative change as demonstrated by the increasing acceptance of online poker activities.
In the Far East, Singapore is encouraging land based casino operators to operate in the country
and the publicised crack down in China on illegal betting shops has shown an acceptance of the
issue.
Management team
The expansion of the management team has been a key target. I am delighted that Richard Creed
and Clive Archer have joined the team at Board level. We are continually strengthening our
operational procedures and improving the management practices at all levels. There is much to do
13
BETonSPORTS plc
Chief executive’s review in an industry which is developing at a very fast pace and the strategic and operational skills added
by Richard and Clive are especially valuable. Richard has a track record of worldwide mergers and
acquisitions experience and Clive provides considerable operational and management expertise
with a particular emphasis on marketing.
Outlook
I am pleased to report that the gross win margin on the sportsbook has returned to historic trends
and is ahead of forecast.
New customer sign-ups and customer cash deposits are also in line with forecast and slightly in
advance of 2004 levels.
The launch of poker and the repositioning of the on-line casino are progressing well. Despite the
strong seasonality of our business, we are pleased with the results achieved in the first quarter and
look forward with confidence to continuing the development of our business in our core and new
markets across the world.

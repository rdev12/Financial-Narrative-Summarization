Kemin Resources Plc 
Annual Report 201 5
03
Since our H1 2015 results, where we reported 
that it would not make economic sense to 
accelerate into production our Drozhilovskoye 
and Smirnovskoye deposits given current market 
conditions, we have been undertaking certain 
further work to optimise returns to shareholders  
in the future. During this period we are aware that 
we also need to maintain our focus on keeping  
our operating costs to a minimum, with the aim  
to be able to move quickly once the conditions  
are conducive to the development of the asset.
We are currently in the process of renewing the 
licences for both sites, and have provided all 
the necessary documentation to the relevant 
authorities in Kazakhstan. The normal process 
time tends to span between 9-12 months. We are 
confident we will obtain the necessary licence 
extensions and expect the confirmation of licence 
extension for contract 1605 (Smirnovskoye) in H2 
2016. This licence will run until 2018 with contract 
1606 (Drozhilovskoye) running to 2021.
Licence 1605 recently expired in May 2016 but we 
expect to obtain confirmation in relation to this in 
H2 2016 or H1 2017 at the latest. 
The recent price performance of Molybdenum  
and Tungsten has stabilised with the current  
prices for Molybdenum and Tungsten in the  
region of US$16,000 and US$10,500/mt 
respectively. We do not believe that moving  
the resources to the production phase at these 
prices will deliver the maximum return to 
 our shareholders.
As noted in the 2015 interims, Kemin’s 
management team has been continuing its work 
following up on the recommendations provided 
by consultants for both Drozhilovskoye and 
Smirnovskoye. A number of key actions were 
identified at that stage, and these are forming 
the basis of the current work programme,  
and are expanded on below: 
 ■ further infill drilling of the ore body  
has been undertaken and specific areas  
have been targeted in order to increase  
the resource confidence. During 2015 
19 exploratory holes were drilled on the 
Smirnovskaya prospect, and 34 in the 
Drozhilovskoe deposit with a number  
of core samples being processed. In  
particular further laboratory testing  
has been undertaken into the metallurgy 
properties of tungsten and to identify  
other resources such as lithium, rubidium  
and caesium and their potential value;
 ■ upgrades have been made at both sites  
to the infrastructure to include hydro 
geological works, and upgrades to the 
pumping stations and offices. Further 
work has been undertaken in relation to 
geophysical surveys, topographical studies 
and assessments in relation to environmental 
impact of development and; 
 ■ an updated geological model is being 
completed encompassing the results 
obtained from the additional drilling 
complimented with modelling techniques  
as recommended by the external advisors  
to better understand the available resources.
It is expected that once the geological model  
has been re-assessed and remodelled using 
implicit modelling techniques and further 
metallurgical studies are carried out on tungsten, 
a more detailed pit optimisation and push back 
study will be carried out which we anticipate will 
be completed in H1 2017. This will be key in order 
to better determine the mining options and to 
complete a life of mine plan. It is envisaged that  
the greater depth of information available will 
be used to complete more detailed Competent 
Person’s Report in relation to both deposits.  
The current intention is to finalise the report  
once the work programme is completed, and  
move onto a feasibility study after this stage. 
The key factors now required to move the 
Company forward are out of the Company’s 
control, being the improvement in the price of 
both molybdenum and tungsten. Albeit it is not 
envisaged that the price will return to the levels  
of a few years ago, the Board does believe there  
will be a cyclical upturn in the price sufficient to 
justify the move to development. At this point  
the Company will be well positioned to move 
ahead quickly with the roll out plan to move  
into production.
As reported in the interims a number of 
preliminary discussions were undertaken with 
Chinese groups however there are currently 
no plans to follow up on any of the discussions 
that were held. We still believe that there are 
good opportunities to work with a number of 
interested parties, however the Board is of the 
opinion that this is better undertaken once 
a more defined roll out plan, backed up with 
more detailed information, is developed. 
“The recent price performance of 
Molybdenum and Tungsten has 
stabilised with the current prices  
for Molybdenum and Tungsten 
in the region of US$16,000 and 
US$10,500/mt respectively. We 
do not believe that moving the 
resources to the production 
phase at these prices will deliver 
the maximum return to our 
shareholders.”

Officer’s report continued
Administrative expenses reduced from 
£340,000 last year to £309,000 in the current 
year, due to cuts at Head Office in the 
support functions of investor relations and 
consultancy, they are set to reduce again  
in the forthcoming year.
Cost control
Financial performance review
The consolidated loss attributable to  
Kemin shareholders in the twelve months  
ended 31 December 2015 was £1,101,000  
(FY 2014: £818,000). The overall loss including  
that attributable to minority shareholders  
was £1,261,000 (2014:£870,000), an increase  
of £391,000.
The increase in the loss is principally a reflection  
of the devaluation of the Kazakh Tenge in the  
year, which saw it reduce in value against the 
Pound and US Dollar by 75% from the start of  
year. The retranslation of the non intercompany 
dollar denominated loans in the subsidiary has 
resulted in forex loss of approximately £575,000 
due to this devaluation. The other principal 
expense relates to finance charges which total 
£377,000. These are accrued charges mainly in 
relation to the borrowings from Amrita, which  
are in line with the prior year. Administrative 
expenses reduced from £340,000 last year  
to £309,000 in the current year, due to cuts  
at Head Office in the support functions of  
investor relations and consultancy, they are  
set to reduce again in the forthcoming year.
As in the prior year the cash spend is kept to 
a minimum at present with a limited capital 
expenditure programme. 
The current cash balances and availability of  
further draw downs on the loan facility if required, 
provides sufficient funds for the company to 
continue to meet its current obligations.

Key performance indicators
Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks exposed to the Company are:
 ■ availability of future funding;
 ■ political and economic environment;
 ■ fluctuation in commodity prices;
 ■ financial risk; 
 ■ the resource differing in grade and quantity  
to that predicted by feasibility studies;
 ■ fluctuations in exchange rates resulting from 
changes in the value of the Kazakh Tenge.
Mitigation of risks and uncertainties
The Company’s management has analysed the  
risks and uncertainties and monitors the risks  
as far as it is practical do so given the early 
development of the Company. 
Certain factors are beyond the control of the 
Company such as the fluctuations in the price  
of the commodities. However the Group is aware  
of these factors and tries to mitigate them as far  
as possible. In relation to the commodity prices,  
we plan to preserve the value of our projects  
until such time as commodity prices recover  
in the future. The current plan is to continue 
exploration of the sites in order to maximise  
the value from exploitation of the resource  
at a later stage.
The Company cannot control the political and 
economic environment of the country in which 
the resources are based. However, to minimise 
the risk, Kemin maintains close relationships with 
the Kazakhstan authorities in order to minimise 
bureaucratic delays and problems.

The Company has no current plans to raise further 
finance at present. However in the future it is 
the Company’s aim is to fix interest rates, where 
possible, with the preferred option being to raise 
funds via equity. As stated the Company has 
sufficient working capital facilities at present  
to meet its current cash flow requirements.
The Company has used independent consultants 
experienced in resource reports, of the type 
required by the Group, to mitigate as far as possible 
any material changes in the resource estimates. 
Key performance indicators
Given the stage of development of the Company,  
the key performance indicators used by the 
management for monitoring progress and strategic 
objectives for the business are set out below: 
Reduction in value of the exploration expenditure 
is due to the effect of the existing devaluation  
of the Kazakh Tenge against Sterling.
The key statistic is the level of resources which 
has been measured under the GKZ classification 
and will be updated under JORC (2012) by an 
independent consultancy once the additional 
exploration and evaluation work is completed.  
This is expected to be completed in H1 2017.
Given the stage of development of the Group, 
it has a low number of employees who are 
concentrated in the head office. Details of the 
Group policy on employees are given on page 09.

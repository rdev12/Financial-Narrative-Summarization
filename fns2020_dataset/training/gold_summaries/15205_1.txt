Chief Executive’s Review
The year under review can be divided into 
two parts, the ﬁrst being the ﬁnancial, and 
the second the commercial. As to the ﬁrst, 
a reduction in revenues together with a 
substantial trading loss was recorded. The cause 
for this exceptional result following a proﬁt trend 
was a delay in expected sales from markets 
where we could see a process of legislative 
change, albeit not implemented, and a change 
in operating policies. The change in operating 
policies led to a signiﬁcant reduction of 
receivables and also stocks held by the distributor 
network. This resulted in an improved working-
capital cycle and a reduced exposure to credit 
risk. The cash generated from this strategy was 
£0.45 million, and this was re-invested into 
product research and development. 
On the second part, the commercial, we 
achieved considerable success. The foundations 
were created to increase revenues and a move 
back into proﬁtability during 2013. In the period, 
new products, new markets and new territories 
were identiﬁed and established. Laboratory 
trials for new products in our d
2
w, d
2
p and d
2
t 
technologies showed encouraging results which 
led to several lengthy commercial trials with end 
user corporations which are still ongoing. 
The technical and marketing team were active 
throughout the year by focusing politicians’ and 
consumers’ attention to the beneﬁt of plastics 
with d
2
w inside. This activity was supported by 
the life-cycle-analysis that was commissioned 
by us and issued by Intertek in May 2012. We 
believe that the results of these actions will 
encourage countries to look at the d
2
w oxo-
biodegradable option rather than ban or restrict 
the use of plastics altogether. Pakistan and the 
UAE have changed legislation in favour of our 
type of oxo-biodegradable technology, and 
others have also followed this course. The 
Symphony technical team has been active in 
many ways, and in particular, are committee 
members in most of the main standards 
organisations such as ASTM, BSI, and ISO.

Business review Governance Financial statements
This strategy helps to ensure that our type of 
technologies are recognised and supported. 
Additionally, we continue to extend our market 
reach and the global distribution network 
expanded to 72 (2011: 67) during 2012.
The Symphony Recycling division also made 
some positive steps forward and continues to 
develop its recycling technologies. The RuPERT 
project was successfully completed in 
December 2012.
Operationally, the following was achieved  
during 2012:
 Accreditation to ISO14001
 Opening of our development facility in  
Telford, UK
 Launch of our d

Trading results
Total Group revenues were lower at £4.94 million 
(2011: £8.54 million). Group gross proﬁt margins 
reduced from 54% to 44%. These factors 
resulted in a 53% decrease in the contribution 
from gross proﬁt from £4.59 million in 2011 
to £2.15 million in 2012. Gross margins were 
reduced due to the sales mix leaning towards 
the lower value areas while the higher value 
regions reduced their local stock levels.
Sales to the Americas reduced from £4.62 
million in 2011 to £2.11 million in 2012 and 
represented 43% of 2012 revenues (2011: 54%). 
This was the main area where stocks and 
receivables were high at the end of 2011 and so 
suffered as a result of the change in operating 
policies. Our primary markets in this sector 
are Mexico and Brazil. 
Sales to UK and Europe reduced from £1.97 
million in 2011 to £1.38 million in 2012 and 
represented 28% of 2012 revenues (2011: 23%). 
This includes sales to Italy which was strong in 
2011 but confused packaging legislation in the 
country led to reduced volumes in 2012. 
Sales to the Rest of the World reduced from 
£1.95 million in 2011 to £1.45 million in 2012 and 
represented 29% of 2012 revenues (2011: 23%). 
Territories include the UAE which also had high 
stocks at the end of 2011. 
Total expenses increased to £4.21 million (2011: 
£3.90 million) which included provisions against 
receivables of £0.39 million (2011: £nil). Total 
staff costs were marginally higher at £2.16 
million (2011: £2.02 million) and Directors’ 
emoluments reduced to £0.87 million in 2012 
from £0.89 million in 2011.
The Group made an operating loss of £2.18 
million compared with an operating proﬁt of 
£0.50 million in 2011, resulting in the Group’s 
loss before tax of £2.20 million compared with 
a proﬁt before tax of £0.42 million in 2011. 
Development costs of £0.36 million were 
capitalised in 2012 (2011: £0.24 million). The net 
book value of capitalised development costs at 
the end of the year amounted to £1.31 million. 
Further development expenditure of £0.32 
million (2011: £0.34 million) was charged directly 
to proﬁt and loss. Capitalised development costs 
represent 9% of expenses as detailed above. 
Within the total amount of £1.31 million 
capitalised to date are: £0.48 million relating to 
Symphony Recycling Technologies; £0.25 million 
relating to d
2
w products which have been 
developed and are being sold; and the balance 
of £0.58 million, relating to further environmental 
plastic applications still in development, and 
where we believe signiﬁcant revenues will be 
generated in the foreseeable future. Symphony Environmental

The Group reports a loss for the year of £2.22 
million with basic loss per share of 1.74 pence 
(2011: earnings per share 0.42 pence). 
The Group’s primary selling currency is the 
US Dollar. The Group hedges where possible 
by purchasing in US Dollars and has banking 
facilities in place in order to secure rates going 
forward. As at 31 December 2012 the Group 
had a net balance of US Dollar assets totalling 
$0.32 million (2011: $5.14 million). 
Segmental analysis
The Group operates two divisions which are 
classiﬁed as segments in the ﬁnancial report, 
being the Plastics division and the Recycling 
Technologies division. 
The Plastics division includes revenues 
associated with d
2
w, d
2
p and d
2
Detector, 
be they additives or ﬁnished products. The 
Plastics division, which currently makes up 
all Group revenues, saw d
2
w additive volumes 
decrease by 40% during the year with d
2
w 
revenues reducing to £4.94 million (2011: 
£8.54 million) due to delays in expected orders 
and changes in operating polices as stated 
above. This, together with the fall in gross 
margins and increased administrative 
expenses, resulted in an EBITDA loss of 
£1.75 million in 2012 compared to a proﬁt 
of £0.86 million in 2011. 
The Recycling Technologies division has no 
revenues to date and saw expenditure of 
£0.27 million for the year resulting in an 
EBITDA loss of the same amount (2011 
expenditure and EBITDA loss: £0.22 million).
Cashﬂow
The Group generated £0.45 million from 
operations (2011: cash consumed £0.19 
million). This was due to a change in operating 
policies which led to stricter stock and 
receivables controls within the distribution 
network. The Group has a £1 million trade 
ﬁnance facility with HSBC Bank plc which 
was drawn down to £0.22 million as at 
31 December 2012 (drawn down to £0.38 
million at 31 December 2011) which is used 
to manage Group working capital.
In addition to development costs detailed 
above, £0.04 million was invested in plant 
and equipment, representing continued 
investment in a development centre in Telford, 
UK, together with other laboratory equipment 
and facilities. A total of £0.06 million was 
spent on property, plant and equipment 
in 2012 (2011: £0.28 million).
Symphony Recycling Technologies 
The RuPERT tyre recycling project was 
successfully completed in December 2012. 
The Group continues to invest in and is 
actively pursuing commercial outlets. In early 
2013 we launched the SymTyre-S300 tyre 
reduction machine. We anticipate that this 
will generate revenues in the short term, 
and also open the way for commercialisation 
of future developments as and when they 
come on stream.
Outlook
2013 has started strongly with sales showing 
a 100% improvement from the same period 
last year. Our main established markets are 
reporting tight stock levels and steady to 
increasing sales momentum. The new 
markets for d
2
w have provided encouraging 
sales projections and marketing activity 
information. They have also started 
placing orders. 
The Pakistan legislation prohibiting plastics 
which are not oxo-biodegradable comes 
into effect in April 2013. This follows similar 
legislation previously passed in the United 
Arab Emirates and recently extended from 2 
products to 15. These changes to legislation 
are expected to be signiﬁcant, not only in 
terms of the local markets, which are

Chairman’s statement
A disciplined approach in a 
challenging environment
Introduction
Welcome to the esure Group plc 2014 
Annual Report, as we look back on 
another year of discipline for the Group, 
in challenging market conditions.
The UK personal lines insurance markets 
remained competitive in 2014, with rate 
reductions characterising both the motor 
and home markets. Some signs of rating 
stabilisation did start to appear in the 
motor market in the latter part of the 
year, but claims inflation returned during 
the second half of the year, with market 
data showing an increase in the 
frequency of small bodily injury claims. 
The industry has been through many 
rating cycles in the past, as indeed have I. 
The Board and management team 
continue to make the right decisions  
to position the Business for further 
growth, when market conditions permit, 
with the aim of delivering long term 
stakeholder value.
In December, the Group announced that 
it is to acquire the outstanding 50% of 
Gocompare, for £95.0 million, valuing 
Gocompare at £190.0 million. 
Gocompare.com is one of the UK’s 
leading financial services brands and a 
leading price comparison website in the 
UK. Personally, I am excited about the 
opportunities available to the Group 
through full ownership of Gocompare as 
we begin to drive its strategic direction.
Performance
The Group’s approach to underwriting 
and focus on expenses enabled us to 
deliver a solid set of financial results in 
2014. Gross written premiums reduced  
in 2014 to £517.8 million, as the Group 
remained disciplined in its rating actions 
during the industry’s transition through 
the soft part of the motor rating cycle.
The Group has a strong financial position 
with robust reserves, a conservative 
investment portfolio and capital 
significantly in excess of the minimum 
regulatory requirement. In December 
2014, the Group issued £125.0 million 
6.75% ten year tier two Subordinated 
Notes (“the Notes”) to fund the 
acquisition of the outstanding 50%  
of Gocompare. 
In light of this performance and position, 
the Board has proposed a final dividend 
of 11.7 pence per share, which together 
with the interim dividend of 5.1 pence 
per share, takes the full year dividend  
to 16.8 pence per share. The full year 
dividend of 16.8 pence per share 
represents a payout ratio of 85% of post 
tax profits. The payout ratio comprises  
a base dividend of 50% and a special 
dividend of 35%, demonstrating the 
Group’s commitment to returning excess 
capital to shareholders.
Market
We now have multiple third party pricing 
indices which track market pricing for 
motor and home insurance. In 2014, all 
the indices reported year-on-year rate 
reductions in both the motor and home 
markets. Signs of motor rate stabilisation 
were noted in the third quarter and these 
were followed by modest rate increases 
across the market in the fourth quarter  
of 2014. There were market movements 
in January, although perhaps not as 
significant as those in some years 
previously. We will watch with interest to 
see if the market is prepared to increase 
its rates as we move through 2015.
People
The Group has benefited from the 
Board’s impressive breadth and depth  
as we continue to push forward with our 
strategic objectives. 
On 3 December 2014, Dame Helen 
Alexander and Anthony Hobson 
announced that they will be stepping 
down from their respective positions  
on the Board at the completion of the 
Annual General Meeting in May 2015.

Anthony Hobson have been exceptionally 
valuable members of the Board pre, 
during and post the Group’s IPO. I, along 
with the rest of the Board, would like to 
offer our sincerest thanks and best 
wishes to them both for the future.
Anthony Hobson will leave the Board 
after 12 years, having been with the 
Group through many of its significant 
milestones. Anthony Hobson’s role as 
Chairman of the Investment Committee 
has passed to Anne Richards, who 
assumed the role with effect from 1 
January 2015.
Dame Helen Alexander has been with the 
Group for three years as Deputy Chairman 
and Senior Independent Director. On 1 
January, the role of Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee passed from 
Dame Helen Alexander to Mike Evans.  
On completion of the Annual General 
Meeting, Dame Helen Alexander’s role  
of Senior Independent Director will pass  
to Shirley Garrood. 
There have also been two further 
personnel changes to two of the Group’s 
Committees. I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank Peter Ward for his 
time as Audit Committee Chairman, and  
I am pleased that Shirley Garrood has 
taken over the role of Audit Committee 
Chairman, with Peter Ward remaining on 
the Committee. María Dolores Dancausa 
has also joined the Nomination Committee.
The Group’s executive management team 
has been led by Stuart Vann, Chief 
Executive Officer, Darren Ogden, Chief 
Finance Officer, and further strengthened 
by the addition of David Pitt, Chief 
Operating Officer. This team continue  
to be supported by a highly skilled and 
dedicated workforce throughout the 
Group, for which the Board and I  
are grateful. 
Customers
Finally, our customers are the lifeblood  
of our Business and I would like to thank 
them for their continued support. We will 
continue to listen to their feedback and 
enhance our propositions to meet their 
ever-changing needs.
Summary
During 2014, market expectations  
of inevitable rate increases in motor 
insurance grew but, as we suspected, 
rates did not move tangibly. We 
continue to focus on the opportunities 
for growth that will arise when 
conditions improve. In competitive 
conditions, we remain very well placed. 
Again, it is our people and customers 
who make esure Group what it is today 
and to all of them, I am thankful.

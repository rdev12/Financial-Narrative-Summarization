Lamprell plc  Annual report and accounts 2010

2010 proved to be a very positive 
year for the Company as we saw 
significant improvement in many of 
our operating markets after the 
turbulent period experienced 
during the economic crisis.
Strengthening oil prices have 
contributed to unprecedented levels 
of enquiries and bid activity. A 
positive development was the 
unforeseen turnaround in the new 
build jackup market in the second 
half of the year. This was in part 
triggered by a post Macondo effect 
but moreover by a continuing drive 
for more modern, cost effective and 
efficient drilling units designed to 
meet the ever increasing technical 
demands of the drilling industry.
Given the continuing emergence 
from the global financial crisis the 
results for the year were very 
pleasing with revenues for the year 
totalling USD 504 million, resulting 
in a net profit for the period of 
USD 66.6 million (USD 65.2 million 
after exceptional charges), 
reinforcing the strong commercial 
foundations of the business and 
the benefits of our tight 
management of operational and 
capital expenditure over the last 
two years.
The prevailing economic climate, 
whilst still uncertain in a number of 
ways, has provided a more stable 
backdrop in recent months, and 
the strengthening oil price has 
encouraged more operator activity, 
improving sentiment throughout 
the industry’s supply chain.
Our long-standing strategy of 
maintaining a strong balance sheet 
has continued to underpin our 
disciplined fiscal approach even as 
markets became more active, and 
this rigorous control remains central 
to our activities.
We also continue to focus on 
delivering best in class execution 
of projects, on time and on budget. 
This has long been our operating 
benchmark, and yet again in 2010 
we saw the benefits of this 
delivery-led strategy as repeat 
business contributed significantly to 
revenues. We believe that this close 
attention to providing our customers 
with exactly what they require is 
fundamental in ensuring the long 
term growth of our business.
Throughout 2010 the Company 
continued to place great emphasis 
on the development and application 
of practices designed to provide a 
workplace that is both safe and 
which minimises environmental 
impact. In 2011 the Company 
remains focused on these key 
aspects of the operation of 
its business.
Significant project milestones 
during the year included the 
Company delivering its first new 
build tender assist drilling barge, 
BassDrill Alpha, in January 2010 as 
well as resolving the outstanding 
payment issue relating to the 
barge. The Company received a 
cash payment of USD 55 million 
and 28,000,000 shares in BassDrill, 
representing 20% of BassDrill’s 
equity. The Company has recently 
exercised its put option in respect 
of these shares, receiving  
USD 2.6 million as consideration 
for its shareholding. 
In April 2010 we were very pleased 
to deliver our second new build 
LeTourneau Super 116E jackup 
drilling rig, the Offshore Mischief, to 
Scorpion Rigs LTD. Other notable

projects executed during the year 
included the fabrication of the 
Livorno FPSO process modules for 
Saipem S.p.A. with the final module 
being delivered in September 2010 
together with the construction of 
two offshore well-head platforms for 
a leading oil and gas operator in 
India, which were completed and 
delivered in Q1 2011.
2010 was our most successful year 
in terms of new orders amounting 
to USD 1.2 billion, with our order 
book standing at USD 850 million 
at the end of the period.
Particularly pleasing were a 
number of new build construction 
contracts for both self-propelled 
offshore wind turbine installation 
vessels and jackup drilling rigs.
In February, the Company 
announced that it had received 
two significant new contract 
awards from Fred Olsen 
Windcarrier AS (“Windcarrier”), 
which in aggregate totalled 
USD 320.4 million. 
The Engineering, Procurement & 
Construction (“EPC”) contract 
awards from Windcarrier were for 
the design, construction and 
delivery of two Gusto MSC NG-
9000 design self elevating and 
self-propelled offshore wind turbine 
installation vessels. Both vessels will 
be constructed at Lamprell’s Jebel 
Ali facility and will be delivered in Q2 
and Q3 of 2012. 
In addition to these contracts for 
two units, Lamprell and Windcarrier 
executed an option agreement for 
two further vessels, the first of 
which has now lapsed, whereas the 
second may be exercised up until 
August 2011.

the construction and commissioning 
in a shipyard, which is yet to be 
determined, in the Caspian Sea. The 
project is planned to be completed 
24 months from the commencement 
of construction.
February 2011 saw the award of a 
further contract for the construction 
of a LeTourneau Super 116 E 
(Enhanced) Class design rig for a 
new client, Greatship Global 
Energy Services Pte. Ltd., based in 
Singapore. The unit is scheduled 
for delivery in Q4 2012.
Having phased the expenditure on 
the expansion of our facility in the 
Hamriyah Free Zone to reflect the 
prevailing economic conditions, we 
are now seeing the benefits of the 
increased capacity. The significantly 
enlarged quayside has enabled us 
to work on as many as 11 rigs at 
one time, thereby increasing the 
potential of both our rig 
refurbishment and new build 
construction businesses.
Due to the increasing level of 
fabrication activity the Company is 
in advanced negotiation to acquire 
an additional 40,000m
2 
of land 
immediately adjacent to our 
existing yard bringing the total 
area within the Hamriyah Free Zone 
to 335,000m

.
In rig refurbishment we have 
worked on a total of 43 jackup rigs 
in 2010 and these projects have 
included work scopes covering the 
full range of our upgrade and 
refurbishment services. Projects 
We believe that our early entry 
into this new and promising 
construction market, with the 
Company now regarded as one of 
the leading providers of liftboats for 
offshore wind turbine installation, 
positions the Company well as the 
offshore wind sector matures in the 
medium and longer term.
This early positioning and the 
revenue benefits of repeat business 
were reinforced by the receipt in July 
of a USD 129.0 million new contract 
award from Seajacks 3 LTD for the 
design, construction and delivery 
of a Gusto MSC NG-5500 design 
self-elevating and self-propelled 
offshore wind turbine installation 
vessel. The vessel, named “Seajacks 
Zaratan”, will be constructed at 
Lamprell’s Hamriyah facility and is 
due to be delivered in 2012.
It was also pleasing to see more 
positive signs of a strengthening of 
the new build jackup rig market with 
the Company receiving a USD 317 
million contract award from National 
Drilling Company (“NDC”), Abu 
Dhabi in July. This contract with NDC 
is for the construction and delivery of 
two jackup rigs valued at USD 158.5 
million each. The rigs will be 
completely outfitted and equipped, 
LeTourneau designed, self-elevating 
Mobile Offshore Drilling Platforms of 
a Super 116E (Enhanced) Class 
design. Work on the first rig 
commenced in August with delivery 
scheduled for the middle of Q2 2012.
As part of the contract, NDC has 
options for Lamprell to build two 
further jackup rigs, valued at 
USD 158.5 million per rig, exercisable 
during the 12 month period 
commencing on 1 August 2010. 
The NDC contract award facilitated 
the resolution of the Riginvest 
contract issue. Lamprell and 
Riginvest agreed that the contract 
for the construction of a 
LeTourneau Super 116E jackup 
drilling rig terminated upon 
signature of the contract between 
NDC and Lamprell. The rig that 
was being built for Riginvest would 
now be built for NDC. Riginvest 
received a portion of the contract 
advance it initially paid to Lamprell 
as part of the termination 
agreement. From an accounting 
perspective, pursuant to 
International Financial Reporting 
Standards, the cancellation of the 
Riginvest contract created a 
material one-off accounting gain in 
the Company’s financial statements 
for 2010, totalling USD 20.4 million, 
reflecting the gain net of additional 
provisions arising as a result of the 
contract cancellation.
A further positive development for 
our EPC business saw the award in 
November of a USD 210 million 
contract from Eurasia Drilling 
Company Limited for the 
construction and delivery of a 
completely outfitted and equipped, 
LeTourneau designed, self-elevating 
Mobile Offshore Drilling Platform of a 
Super 116E (Enhanced) Class 
design. Lamprell will fabricate the 
jackup rig in modular form in its new 
yard in Hamriyah and then complete  business

have been shared between our 
UAE facilities, with Sharjah working 
on 21 rigs and the Hamriyah facility 
working on 22 jackups. As 
previously guided, the jackup rig 
upgrade and refurbishment activity 
in 2010 was at a lower level of 
average expenditure than in the 
prior year. It remains challenging to 
anticipate activity in this segment 
given the relatively short cycle 
between bidding and the award of 
work. There are, however, 
encouraging signs of renewed 
activity in this market, with the 
Company well placed to receive 
further awards in the near future.
Throughout 2010 we continued to 
construct FPSO process modules 
for Saipem S.p.A and Saipem 
Energy Services S.p.A at our  
Jebel Ali facility and believe that 
this segment of our business will 
benefit from the strengthening oil 
price in the medium term. 
Towards the end of 2010 the 
Company established a core 
Strategic Development Group 
comprising industry specialists 
who are currently working on a 
number of bespoke engineering 
solutions for the upstream 
petroleum sector.
We continue to review all our 
operations to ensure they are 
creating value for our shareholders. 
After a review by management, the 
Board has now agreed to terminate 
the Group’s operation in Thailand 
with effect from 31 December 
2010. The total cost of closing the 
facility was not material.
t he board
In March 2010 Chris Hand was 
appointed as Chief Operating 
Officer, and joined the Board in 
January 2011. Chris brings to the 
Board 15 years of experience with 
Lamprell and I am certain he will 
make a very valuable contribution 
in the coming years. In December, 
Scott Doak, our Chief Financial 
Officer, informed the Board that he 
wishes to leave the Company by 
the end of 2011 to pursue other 
interests. Scott will, by then, have 
spent almost five years with the 
Company and played a significant 
part in taking the Company on to 
The London Stock Exchange AIM 
market, on to the Main List and 
through one of the most difficult 
periods the industry has ever 
faced. We would like to thank Scott 
for his hard work and 
professionalism undertaken during 
this very demanding period in the 
Company's history. The Company 
is currently seeking a successor to 
Scott. Scott will facilitate the 
handover to the new person when 
he or she has been appointed.
market overview
The Company has a record bid 
pipeline at this time. In particular 
we have seen an increase in 
activity levels in the new build 
jackup market, reflecting the 
current buoyancy of that market 
segment. While the full impact of 
the deepwater Macondo oil spill in 
the US Gulf of Mexico on the wider 
rig market has yet to fully unwind, 
many sector analysts are predicting 
a continuation in the new build 
programmes as the market for 
higher specification rigs remains 
strong. As the search for oil and 
gas becomes increasingly more 
technically demanding rigs that can 
drill deeper, horizontal wells more 
cost effectively in deeper, harsh 
environment, waters will demand 
higher day-rates and hence will 
help drive the new build rig 
construction market.
As previously reported, we 
experienced a slowdown in the 
rig refurbishment market in the 
second half of 2010, however 
there are now encouraging signs 
of renewed activity in this market. 
We continue to see significant 
potential for Lamprell in the liftboat 
market in the medium and longer 
term and aim to build on our early 
leadership position in this part of 
our business.
The Company is actively pursuing a 
number of exciting prospects for its 
oilfield engineering business 
including new build land rigs, 
refurbishment projects and 
equipment overhaul and is 
confident that new business for this 
segment can be secured in the 
coming months.
Dividend
The Board of Directors is 
recommending a final dividend 
payment of 9.50 cents per ordinary 
share. This will be payable, when 
approved, on 17 June 2011 to 
eligible shareholders on the register 
at 13 May 2011.
o utlook
Building upon the success of 2010, 
2011 has started encouragingly. 
We maintain our focus on existing 
core business, together with 
complementary markets. The 
Company is confident in its 
prospects for future growth and 
success, both for the current year 
and in the longer term, based upon 
both its record order book position, 
and the strengthening which it sees 
in its key markets.
I would again like to take this 
opportunity to express my 
personal thanks, together with 
those of the Board of Directors, to 
all of our management, staff and 
employees for their hard work and 
dedication which they have given 
throughout the year. With over 
5,000 employees it is indeed a 
credit and achievement that 
everyone has played their part in 
the success of the Company. On a 
final note I would like to thank our 
founder and President, Steven 
Lamprell, for his continuing 
encouragement and support.

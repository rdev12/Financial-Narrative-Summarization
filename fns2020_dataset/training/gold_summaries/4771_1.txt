 Delivering profitable growth and building value 
for shareholders
I am delighted that yet again, Dignity has delivered strong
growth in its operating performance and earnings per share
by continuing to follow its long term strategy. Since the end
of 2007, which marked the start of the recent economic
crisis, the Group’s underlying operating profits have grown
by 28 per cent, cash generated from operations has increased
by 26 per cent and underlying earnings per share have
increased by 39 per cent. The results for 2010 represent the
seventh consecutive year of growth in each of these measures.
The Return of Value in the year means that an investor at the
time of the IPO will have had nearly all their initial investment
returned in cash and still hold shares in Dignity which, at
the current market price, are worth approximately twice
their original investment.
Our consistent strategy and business model continue 
to drive performance:
Continued commitment to client service excellence
We monitor many details about the services we perform 
and the tremendous responses we get back from the families
we serve demonstrate the high level of service that we
provide. Details of these responses are summarised in 
the Business Review.
Continuing to control our costs
It is crucial that as well as increasing revenues, we control 
our costs. I am pleased that cost control has remained
strong and that the Group remains focused on this
important aspect of our strategy.
Selective acquisitions of additional funeral locations
We continue to identify and acquire well established
businesses and incorporate them into our funeral location
portfolio.The funeral services market remains very
fragmented, which should lead to further acquisition
opportunities in the coming years. In addition, we are
testing a number of satellite funeral locations.
Developing, managing or acquiring additional 
crematoria where possible
In the last couple of years, development activity in the
crematoria division has increased significantly. 
Our crematoria portfolio has increased to 33 with a further
two due to become operational in 2011.
National marketing, principally through affinity partners, 
of pre-arranged funeral plans
This source of incremental future business for our funeral
division has had a very successful year. This is attributable 
to strong relationships being developed with our affinity
partners, in particular the Age UK charity. 
A strong platform for sustainable growth
Over the years, we have demonstrated that the strategy we
operate suits the stable nature of this business. This was
demonstrated very well in 2010 with the Group rebalancing
its capital structure through the issue of further Secured
Notes and the return of £1 per Ordinary Share to our
shareholders.
Valuing our people
Our history of success is undoubtedly due to our stable and
experienced management team. I remain grateful for their
ceaseless efforts to improve the service we provide. All our
staff remain key to the success of this business. I would like
to pay tribute to each of them and in particular thank them
for the extraordinary lengths they went to in December
during the terrible weather. As a result of their efforts, only
a very small number of funerals and cremations had to 
be rescheduled.
It gives me great pleasure that we were able to share the
Group’s success with our staff, by paying a total of £1.7
million discretionary bonus payments, an increase of 13 per
cent on the previous year. All full time employees with full
attendance received over £1,000.
Serving our local communities for generations
We are funeral people. This is all we do and we are obsessive
about it. Our local businesses have, in many cases, been
established in their communities for generations and to this
day we have many employees who are descendants of the
founders of those businesses.
Serving the people in our local communities at one of the
most difficult times in their lives remains at the centre of
everything we do at Dignity.

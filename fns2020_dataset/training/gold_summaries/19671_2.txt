Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements
This Annual Report may contain forward-looking statements which are made in good faith and are based on current expectations or beliefs, as well as 
assumptions about future events. You can sometimes, but not always, identify these statements by the use of a date in the future or such words as “will”, 
“anticipate”, “estimate”, “expect”, “project”, “intend”, “plan”, “should”, “may”, “assume” and other similar words. By their nature, forward-looking statements 
are inherently predictive and speculative and involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will occur in 
the future. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are not a guarantee of future performance and are subject 
to factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these statements. The Company undertakes no 
obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

 Key performance indicators
and financial highlights
Key performance indicators (KPIs)
We use a range of performance indicators, both financial and non-
financial, to measure both the delivery of the Company’s strategic
objectives and to manage the business. The most important of 
these measures are considered KPIs and their targets are determined
annually during the business planning process. The KPIs are used by
management to compare actual performance during the year, and 
the latest monthly forecasts, against the annual budgeted targets. 
Our KPIs, both financial and non-financial, are set out below.
* Financial KPIs are presented excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark 
to market movements
The explanations of our KPIs are as follows:
Profit from operations (PFO)
PFO is a measure of the operating profitability of the Group. It excludes
the impact of all non-operating costs from subsidiaries, including
financing costs and income tax expense, and therefore provides a
comprehensive measure of operational and financial performance. We
consider PFO excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to
market movements to be an appropriate indicator of performance, as
this measure: excludes significant items which, by virtue of their size 
or incidence, could potentially distort year-on-year comparisons; allows 
a better understanding of the financial information presented, and
specifically the Group’s underlying business performance by excluding
fair value movements on economic hedges; and assists shareholders and
analysts who have expressed a preference for the reporting of results
without the inclusion of the effects of exceptional items and specific IAS
39 mark to market movements. Presenting the Group’s segment and
total PFO excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to
market movements is consistent with the way management measures
the Group’s performance in its budgets, forecasts and management
accounts on a day-to-day basis. PFO excluding exceptional items and
specific IAS 39 mark to market movements is presented in the
consolidated income statement on page 79. The results of this KPI for
2005 and 2006 and the objective for 2007 are set out on page 22.
Earnings per share (EPS)
EPS is a measure of the overall profitability of the Group and
shareholder returns. It is defined as the profit in pence attributable to
each Ordinary Share in the Company, based on the consolidated profit
for the year, after deducting tax, minority interests, and when applicable,
preference share dividends. The calculation is shown in note 11 to the
financial statements. Growth in EPS over time is indicative of the ability
of the Group to add value. We consider EPS excluding exceptional items
and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements as an appropriate
indicator of performance as it: excludes significant items which, by virtue
of their size or incidence, could potentially distort the year-on-year
comparison; allows a better understanding of the financial information
presented, and specifically the Group’s underlying business performance
by excluding fair value movements on economic hedges; and assists
shareholders and analysts who have expressed a preference for the
reporting of results without the inclusion of the effects of exceptional
items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements. This is consistent
with the way management measures the Group’s performance in its
budgets, forecasts and management accounts on a day-to-day basis.
The results of this KPI for 2005 and 2006 and the objective for 2007
are set out on page 22.
In 2005 we reported this KPI as EPS before exceptional items. We have
changed the basis of measurement in 2006 to reflect how we now
measure underlying business performance before both exceptional items
and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements.

6707-01_IPreport2006_AW tp  3/23/07  10:12  Page 20 Free cash flow
Power generation is a capital intensive business and hence it requires the
assets within the Group to generate sufficient cash to repay the initial
investment in the assets, to provide returns for shareholders and to
provide funds for future investment opportunities. We define free cash
flow as net cash flow from operating activities excluding exceptional
cash flows associated with items recorded as exceptional in the income
statement, and capital expenditure for growth projects (which enhances
the economic benefits of the Group). Free cash flow includes capital
expenditure to maintain the operating capability of the Group (by
replacing or restoring individual assets or components), interest, and tax. 
We consider this measure of cash flow to be a key indicator of 
business performance as it measures the cash generated from
underlying business performance from continuing operating activities.
This is consistent with the way management measures the Group’s
performance in its budgets, forecasts and management accounts on 
a day-to-day basis. The derivation of free cash flow and the results of
this KPI for 2005 and 2006 are set out on page 22.
Accident frequency rate (AFR)
Health and safety is of vital importance in our business. Not only is it
important to provide employees with a safe place to work, any accident
is disruptive to the running of the business. AFR is the normal reporting
standard and is defined as the number of lost time accidents (LTAs)
divided by the number of hours worked, multiplied by 100,000. A LTA
is an accident where an individual is away from work for more than one
day and is an auditable indicator across a number of industries. 
In 2005 the AFR for employees and contractors combined was 0.23. 
In 2006 there was a very strong improvement to 0.12. International
Power intends to consolidate this by establishing a target of 0.12 for
2007. This does not mean we tolerate unsafe behaviour; we seek to
have zero LTAs but targets need to be realistic and challenging. The data
underlying these calculations is submitted by individual plants directly
into the corporate reporting system.
Reportable environmental incidents
The environment and how we care for it is central to the business 
of International Power and we have always had a policy commitment 
to comply with all applicable environmental regulations. One measure 
of our compliance with this policy is compliance with environmental
licences for our power plants, issued by the relevant statutory
authorities. Environmental licences require that any environmental
incident is reported. The underlying data is submitted by individual
plants directly into the corporate reporting system. The results of
this KPI for 2005 and 2006, and the objective for 2007 are set
out on page 22.
Technical availability
Technical availability measures when a plant is available for dispatch.
Each of our plants will generally be unavailable during some periods in
the year due to a combination of planned outages for maintenance and
unplanned outages due to plant breakdowns or operational problems. 
An important part of our business is ensuring that our trading and
power purchase agreements are closely aligned to our operational
activities and availability planning is a key factor in this regard. The year-
to-year variance in the profile of planned outages influences both the
achieved and targeted availability. Technical availability is calculated by
first determining the potential maximum amounts of electricity that
could be generated in the year if all the plants were operated at full
output for the entire year. We then deduct from this the electricity that
could not be produced due to planned and unplanned outages that
occurred at the plants throughout the year. This number is then
expressed as a percentage of the potential maximum electricity that
could be generated, where all these quantities are calculated in terms 
of electrical energy (GWh). This calculation is carried out using data
submitted by the individual plants directly into the corporate reporting
system. The results of this KPI for 2005 and 2006, and the objective for
2007 are set out on page 22.

The financial information included in the consolidated financial
statements has been prepared on the basis of all applicable IFRSs as
adopted by the EU. A discussion of the policies we believe to be most
critical in considering the impact of estimates and judgements on the
Group’s financial position and results of operations are set out on 
pages 42 and 43.
In order to allow a full understanding of the financial information
presented within the consolidated financial statements, and specifically
the Group’s underlying business performance, the Group presents its
income statement such that it separately identifies:
• the results excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark 
to market movements;
• the effect of the exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to 
market movements;
• the total result.
The basis of preparation is outlined more fully in note 1 to the
consolidated financial statements. However, in summary, those items
that the Group separately presents as exceptional are items which, 
in the judgement of the Directors, need to be disclosed separately 
by virtue of their size or incidence in order to obtain a proper
understanding of the financial information. Those items that the Group
separately discloses as specific IAS 39 mark to market movements are
those mark to market movements recorded in the income statement
which relate to: derivative contracts into which the Group has entered 
in order to economically hedge certain of its physical and financial
exposures; and fair value gains and losses on equity conversion features
embedded within convertible bonds, so as to separately identify a 
non-cash movement which, if the conversion option is exercised, 
will ultimately be extinguished by the issue of equity.

2006 PFO (excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to market movements) at £773 million is 44% ahead of 2005. This principally
reflects improved spreads and load factors in New England and Texas, strong contributions from First Hydro, Rugeley, Saltend and our Czech
businesses, and first time contributions from assets in the Middle East. PFO (excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to market

2006 EPS (excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to
market movements) at 22.4p is 53% ahead of 2005. This increase
principally reflects those items discussed under the heading ‘profit from
operations’ and also reflects an increase in interest and tax expense
(both of which are discussed on page 38).

Free cash flow in 2006 at £456 million is 60% ahead of 2005. This
increase was driven by strong operational and financial performance
across the Group together with higher dividends from joint ventures
and associates. This was partially offset by increased tax and interest
payments (£86 million higher) and an increase in maintenance 
capital expenditure of £56 million.

Dividend
The Board is proposing a dividend of 7.9p per share (2005: 4.5p), 
an increase of 75% year-on-year and representing a pay-out ratio of
35% of EPS (excluding exceptional items and specific IAS 39 mark to
market movements). This increase is in line with the Group’s policy 
of progressively moving towards a dividend pay-out ratio of 40%.
Payment of this dividend to shareholders registered on the Company share
register on 25 May 2007 is due to be made on 26 June 2007, following
approval at the 2007 AGM, which will be held on 15 May 2007.
Outlook
Our broadly based international portfolio has been strengthened by 
the successful integration of acquired assets and the addition of new
greenfield projects commissioned in 2006, and provides a solid platform
for our business. This, coupled with a largely forward contracted position
for our merchant market capacity, gives us confidence that 2007 will 
be a year of further growth.

Chairman’s Statement
 We have invested heavily in talent and 
technology during the year and are well 
positioned for the many opportunities  
being generated worldwide by the need  
for identity data intelligence.
 David Rasche
 Chairman
Number of global 
internet users passes 
500 million.
I am extremely pleased with GBG’s performance 
again this year. Revenues and profits continued 
to show strong growth with the Group delivering 
adjusted operating profits

 ahead of market 
expectations. This was achieved on top of the 
additional investment of £3.4 million during the 
year on increasing the scale and reach of our 
international operations, strengthening the senior 
management team and further developing our 
extensive product range.
Revenues increased by 28% to £73.4 million  
(2015: £57.3 million), of which just over half (16%) 
was organic growth

. Even more pleasing was the 
translation of this strong top line performance 
to the adjusted operating profit line with a 24% 
increase to £13.4 million (2015: £10.8 million) and 
an increase in adjusted earnings per share of 34% 
to 10.6 pence (2015: 7.9 pence).
This performance was a direct result of the 
continuing hard work, passion and dedication  
of the GBG team in delivering our strategy and  
I would like to offer my sincere thanks to them  
on behalf of the Board and shareholders.
Dividend
The Board has recommended a 12.4% increase 
in the dividend to 2.08 pence (2015: 1.85 pence), 
continuing our progressive dividend growth  
which we regard as an important component  
of our shareholder return. The dividend is  
subject to approval at the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting to be held on 26 July 2016.  
Upon approval, the dividend will be paid on  
26 August 2016. GBG will, once again, offer 
eligible shareholders the choice to reinvest  
their dividends back into GBG shares by way  
of the Dividend Reinvestment Plan.

Outlook 
The growing market for identity data 
intelligence solutions continues to present 
strong opportunity for our products and I am 
confident that GBG’s clear leadership in this 
area will fuel further growth. We have invested 
heavily in talent and technology during the 
year and are well positioned for the many 
opportunities being generated worldwide 
by the need for identity data intelligence.
We are naturally disappointed that Richard Law 
has indicated his desire to step down as Chief 
Executive once a suitable successor has been 
found but fully understand and support his 
family-based reasons. Our excellent management 
team is ensuring that the business continues to 
thrive while we find the best possible successor. 
The continued success and excellent long-term 
prospects for GBG should enable us to attract the 
highest calibre of talent to take the Group to even 
greater future success.

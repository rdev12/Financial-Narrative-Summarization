Another year of significant developments for the Group
Chief Executive’s Report
It has been a further year of 
significant development for the 
Group.  Having firmly established 
Gresham House as a specialist asset 
manager focused on alternative and 
illiquid assets we have made progress 
on our journey to scale the business. 
This was a key objective we set out 
at the beginning of last year. We 
continue to focus on addressing the 
demand for long-term alternative 
investment strategies and providing 
alternative asset management 
solutions to institutions, family 
offices, charities and endowments. 
We are delivering against our stated 
strategy of growing the business 
organically and through acquisitions 
that enhance the platform. The 
Gresham House brand is gaining 
increased recognition from investors 
and the market as a result.
Building on the solid foundations 
we have established for a long-term 
sustainable and successful group, the 
management team continues to focus 
on the three pillars of “Platform, 
Process and People”.
The Gresham House Platform
The demand for illiquid assets 
is increasing and so too are the 
opportunities for Gresham House.  
We have formed a scalable platform to 
offer a range of alternative investment 
products through our two specialist 
divisions: Strategic Equity covering 
public and private equity and Real 
Assets. This has resulted in significant 
growth of 50% in Assets Under 
Management (“AUM”) to £363 million 
in the year to 31 December 2016 
(2015: £242 million).
Growing AUM and thereby 
sustainable management fees 
including associated performance 
fees or carried interest is critical to 
the Group’s success. The growth in 
AUM during in the year has increased 
revenues by over 200% to £4.3 
million (2015: £1.4 million). The 
annualised management fees for the 
funds being managed at the end of 
December 2016 is £3.9 million from 
zero at the beginning of our journey 
in December 2014.
The Strategic Equity division has 
continued to develop and the team 
now manages three funds. Gresham 
House Asset Management Limited 
(“GHAM”) was awarded the mandate 
in August 2015 to manage Gresham 
House Strategic plc (“GHS”), the 
AIM quoted company investing and 
actively engaging with management 
teams of undervalued smaller UK 
public companies. Subsequent to 
this, in August 2016 we launched 
the Gresham House Strategic Public 
Equity Fund LP (“SPE LP”) with 
£24 million committed capital and 
co-investment. Following shareholder

approval, GHAM was also appointed 
as investment manager to LMS 
Capital plc (“LMS”) in August 2016, 
the London Stock Exchange listed 
private equity company with a Net 
Asset Value (“NAV”) of £68 million at 
31 December 2016.
The Real Assets division, currently 
comprising Gresham House Forestry 
Limited (formerly Aitchesse Limited), 
the specialist asset manager of UK 
commercial forestry, accounted for 
AUM of £247 million at the end of 
the year (2015: £205 million). The 
first close of the Gresham House 
Forestry Fund LP (“GHF LP”) was 
in October 2016 and the subsequent 
purchase of a portfolio of six forests 
in West Scotland added £15 million 
to AUM in the year. We have also 
seen promising growth in the value of 
forests managed by Gresham House, 
making up the remaining £232 
million of AUM.
The importance of technology in 
the daily lives of individuals is 
increasingly significant within asset 
management. Gresham House 
has identified an opportunity to 
materially enhance the client service 
proposition and create value through 
utilising digital platforms. We are 
therefore pleased to have recently 
added a new strategic objective to 
our development plan based around 
a new addition to our team, Andy 
Hampshire, who has joined us 
as Chief Technology Officer from 
Lloyds Development Capital. Andy 
has been tasked with creating value 
through developing a client platform 
to provide a high quality service 
for investors that facilitates co-
investment opportunities.

The Gresham House Process
To continue to build a successful 
business and meet client expectations, 
we have robust processes in place that 
require us to maintain exceptionally 
high standards in delivering sustainable 
value creation over the long term.  Our 
view is that the investment discipline 
needed to manage funds is also 
required to manage the Group and 
as significant shareholders ourselves, 
the management team is focused on 
value creation for all shareholders 
over the long-term. The Investment 
Committee adds to this discipline 
and provides external challenge and 
an independent industry expert view 
to ensure that potential acquisitions 
or capital allocation considered by 
the management team exceed Group 
hurdles.
We have drawn on the Investment 
Committee’s experience in the year and 
are benefitting from the acquisitions 
that we have made to date. All of these 
are meeting or performing ahead of the 
Group’s investment return requirement 
to deliver long-term return on capital 
of 15%.
Process is also essential to integrating 
new businesses into the Gresham 
House family. The integration and 
rebrand of Gresham House Forestry 
was completed in the year, with the 
forestry team now fully embedded in 
the Group. The transition for LMS from 
self-managed to an externally managed 
company is progressing well and we 
continue to work closely with the 
board of LMS and increase our direct 
interaction and engagement with LMS’ 
portfolio companies. This has included 
members of the GHAM team joining 
investee company boards. 
 
The Gresham House People
Gresham House is a people business 
and behind the platform and process 
we have built a strong and dedicated 
team supporting a culture built 
on long-term shareholder value, 
alignment and teamwork.
As mentioned in our Interim Results 
announcement on 28 September 
2016, over the year, we made 
several key hires within the senior 
management team, a number of 
whom have previously worked with 
existing members of the Gresham 
House team.
Kevin Acton joined as Finance 
Director and John-Paul Preston as 
Chief Operating Officer in 2016, both 
adding to the strength of the senior 
management team. 
The specialist investment teams 
have also been enhanced with 
the addition of several significant 
appointments. Richard Davidson 
joined as the Chairman of the 
Investment Committee of the forestry 
business and Pardip Khroud was 
appointed as an Investment Director 
in the Strategic Equity division. 
Nick Friedlos and Tony Sweet have 
also joined as Investment Directors, 
following the appointment of GHAM 
as investment manager to LMS. 
As set out above, Andy Hampshire 
also joined us as our Chief 
Technology Officer in February 2017.
I would like to thank Mike Phillips 
for his contribution to establishing 
the initial foundations of Gresham 
House. Mike stepped down from 
his role as Strategic Development 
Director at the end of the year.  6

Outlook
The increasing allocation to 
alternative investments by pension 
funds highlights the growing 
demand in this area. The chart below 
illustrates the growth trend and the 
opportunity available.
Gresham House is well positioned to 
offer a range of specialist products 
to address the increasing demand in 
the alternative market.
The Company has developed 
significantly under the new 
management team in a relatively 
short two year period and momentum 
is driving us into the coming year.  
Long-term shareholder value creation 
continues to be at the forefront of the 
Board’s strategic focus.
Growth in AUM to generate 
sustainable profit growth remains a 
priority and we are pleased with the 
developments to date, as shown by 
the 50% AUM growth in 2016, which 
gives us greater visibility on near-
term profitability.
We continue to work on a number 
of initiatives for both organic and 
acquisition growth. The recently 
announced Gresham House British 
Strategic Investment Fund, with 
the Royal County of Berkshire 
Pension Fund (“Berkshire”) acting 
as a cornerstone investor, is a good 
example of the Group’s ambition 
to innovate and grow. This new 
platform for the Group aims to 
provide solutions to pension 
schemes and endowments who want 
to access smaller niche alternative 
investments with longer term 
investment horizons in a more 
engaged and cost efficient manner.
The ambition of the Group has also 
been recognised externally with a 
number of new strategic long-term 
investors becoming shareholders, 
including LMS in the year and 
recently Berkshire in March 2017. 
This helps to create a supportive 
and long-term investor base from 
which to grow the business. We 
are also pleased that the Gresham 
House Forestry acquisition is 
achieving the Group’s intended long 
term hurdles of 15%.
We aim to close both the SPE LP and 
GHF LP funds in the second half of 
2017 alongside managing both GHS 
and LMS portfolios to achieve their 
target returns for their respective 
shareholders.

Gresham House is well 
positioned to offer a range of 
specialist products to address 
the increasing demands in the 
alternative market. Chief Executive’s Report continued
There is also a renewed focus on 
realising value from the legacy 
portfolio, with both the Southern 
Gateway site and the remaining 
land at Newton-le-Willows entering 
marketing processes. 
As we have grown the team 
alongside AUM we have also 
reviewed our London office needs. 
In February 2017, the London 
office moved to flexible office 
space at Octagon Point near St 
Paul’s in London, with sufficient 
space to foreseeably accommodate 
the team for the next 18 month’s 
development. 
2017 strategic initiatives aim to 
achieve operating profitability in the 
near-term with a focus on achieving 
attractive operating margins in the 
medium-term. We have a strong 
balance sheet with longer term asset 
management contracts, and we are 
growing additional value through 
balance sheet carried interests in 
the asset management products we 
manage.
We have a busy year ahead of us and 
I am confident that we have the right 
team in place to achieve our goals 
including growing the brand and 
client satisfaction. These initiatives 
alongside an aligned, and capable 
management team are supporting 
the execution of the growth vision, 
with the near-term aim of achieving 
profitability.

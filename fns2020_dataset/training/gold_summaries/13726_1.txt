Chief Executive’s Statement
Since joining Ruspetro, it has been one of my top priorities 
to build upon and enhance our health, safety and 
e n v i ro n m e n t a l 	 ( ‘ H S E’ ) 	 a wa re n e s s 	 a n d 	 pe r fo r ma n c e.
In 2014, we appointed a HSE director to oversee our HSE 
practices, improve policies and ensure that we approach 
HSE issues in the most direct and effective manner. In 
addition, we successfully implemented the EMEX platform 
as a tool to log, monitor and action HSE improvements 
across all operational areas. I am pleased to report only 
one minor lost-time incident in 2014 relating to a slip and 
fall. Our aim is to continue our positive HSE momentum in 
the coming year.
Achievements in 2014
In April 2014, we introduced multiple-fractured 
horizontal wells into our operations. Initially this was 
rather simplistically conceived as a way of connecting the 
discontinuous sands that, with hindsight, had contributed 
to the poor outcome of the vertical well development 
programme in 2012-13.
However, by the second well, we had introduced a radical 
change in fraccing and completion thinking, abandoning 
the standard Western Siberian approach of a small number 
of large fracs, and moving to a concept based on a larger 
number of smaller fracs tuned to the sand distribution seen 
in the well. This required us to source technology proven in 
North America but hitherto unused in Russia
Similarly, we have introduced a number of other 
internationally established technologies to ensure that we 
maximise the insight from these early wells. These include 
geo-steering in the horizontal sections to assess sand 
continuity, and the use of tracers to assess the 
effectiveness of the fracs in each well. This knowledge  
has been embodied in the design of the wells that are to  
be drilled and completed by the second quarter of 2015. 
While I am impressed by the progress that we have made 
w i t h 	 o ur 	 first 	 t w o 	 h o r izo n ta l 	 w e lls 	 an d 	 t h e 	 fo ll ow - u p 	 in 	
early 2015, the reality is that we are still developing our 
understanding of the geology and in particular the possible 
play types in our acreage. Our efforts at geological 
characterisation in the last year have been hampered by a 
chronic geological data shortage resulting from missed data 
co ll ecti o n 	 o p po r t uni ti es 	 in 	 t h e 	 first 	 f ran ti c 	 d eve l o p m e n t 	
campaign in 2012-13. Furthermore, we are only just 
beginning to capitalise on the seismic contribution to 
unlocking our reserves. The bottom line is that that we have 
an immature resource base outside the core area.
Given this blunt assessment, the Board has endorsed a 
strategy starting in the second half of 2015 of an appraisal 
campaign designed to mature between 25 and 75 
development wells. This programme, which includes both 
vertical and horizontal wells, will underpin a resumption 
of our development well campaign in 2016, when we 
believe oil prices may have partly rebounded. 
The working environment 
in which Ruspetro staff 
and our contractors 
operate is particularly 
challenging. Strategic Report

Geosteering of  
Horizontal Wells
• Geosteering technology helps 
to safely maximise horizontal 
s e c t i o n 	 l eng t h 	 ( wel l s 	 do 	 n ot	
en ter 	 h a z a r do u s 	 fo r m a t i o n s ) .
• Structure and reservoir 
distribution are better 
understood and tracking 
reservoirs improves the 
likelihood of successful  
frac initiation.

Th i s 	 st ra teg y 	 w i l l 	 ha ve 	 t w o 	 k e y 	 a d d i t i o na l 	 be n efi t s :
• With an inventory of de-risked development wells, we 
will be able to plan and deliver a sustainable 
improvement in drilling and completion performance by 
driving learning, leveraging the market for services, and 
improving our operating practices.
• It will provide a sound basis for the generation of a 
coherent facilities plan based on a more realistic view of 
our future production levels and precisely where in our 
acreage they are being generated.
Palyanovo
In January 2014, we suspended production of gas and 
co n d e nsa te 	 in 	 t h e 	 P a l yan o v o 	 fi e l d, 	 p r imar il y 	 t o 	 co nse r ve	
gas while we evaluated further options to commercialise 
the gas reserves. Discussions are progressing with an 
international counterparty in this regard. In the meantime, 
we are taking the opportunity of the suspension of 
production to collect key sub-surface data with a view to 
u pda tin g 	 t h e 	 g as 	 fi e l d 	 d eve l o p m e n t 	 p lan 	 in 	 2 0 15 . 	 Dur in g 	
2015, we will also update our Russian reserves for the 
Palyanovo licence ahead of its planned renewal by the 
year-end.
Drilling Horizontal Wells 
With Multistage Fracs
• Drilling long horizontal wells  
is critical to increase the odds 
o f 	 en c o u n ter i ng 	 p r o l i fic 	 d i s c r e te 	
reservoir bodies.
• Conducting multi-stage 
fracture stimulation will then 
ensure the reservoir volumes 
are effectively drained. 10 Ruspetro plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Microseismic Monitoring  
of Frac Stimulation
• Microseismic monitoring 
helps to understand fracture 
dimension and orientation so 
frac parameters and design can 
be tuned. 
• It is critical to understand 
whether frac grow in unwanted 
formation or fault zones.
• As a consequence horizontal 
wells can be placed in optimal 
l o c a t i o n s 	 ( spac i ng 	 a n d	
or i en t a t i on ) .

Aims for 2015
Our objectives for 2015 are to:
• Increase oil production by squeezing our existing stock

effectiveness in the core PI area.
• Complete our horizontal development well rollout in 
the area of pad 23b.
• Initiate an appraisal campaign to build an inventory of 
mature development locations. Four areas are currently 
targeted in this campaign.
• M a t u re 	 o u r 	 d e ve l o p m e n t 	 t oo l k i t 	 ( te ch n o l og y , 	 d e si g n,

geosteering, seismic visualisation, novel well designs, 
optimised completion technology, rig strategies, etc.
• Im p l e m e n t 	 fi t - fo r - p u r pose 	 i n f ra st r u c t u re 	
enhancements to support the programme.
• Radically improve our understanding of the gas 
reserves and production potential of Palyanovo.
Costs and cash management
The restructuring transaction, while transformational for 
the longer term, was highly complex and inevitably 
time-consuming. Nevertheless, we were able to make a 
start with our horizontal well programme, using oil 
pre-payment facilities and an additional loan from 
L i m o l i n e s 	 T ra n spo r t 	 L i m i te d 	 ( ‘ L i m o l i n e s ’ ) , 	 o n e 	 o f	 
our main shareholders.
These early wells represent the evolution of our 
development thinking and technology application. 
Perhaps as importantly, they have driven a fundamental 
rebuild in our drilling services contracting strategy and 
allowed us to deliver a highly competitive benchmark well 
cost for the future. 
Despite the availability of new funds, a lower oil price is 
our reality. We will continue with a highly disciplined 
approach to managing our cash. As we have successfully 
done with our drilling costs, we will continue our drive to 
reduce to the greatest extent possible dollar-denominated 
services, and perhaps capitalise on the assumed  
slowdown in Russia to look for keen bids for any  
new capital expenditure.

 Oxford Instruments plc | Report and Financial Statements 2015 04
The Group remains confident in the 
execution of our Nanotechnology 
strategy despite the challenges 
we faced this year.
Highlights
The integration of Andor Technology continues to progress well, and we met our targets in the 
full first year of reporting. However, our Plasma Technology business suffered as a result of trade 
sanctions placed on exports to Russia during the year and the decrease in demand for High Brightness 
Light Emitting Diodes (HBLED). As a Group we have also been impacted by the slower-than-expected 
recovery in our Japanese markets. We have therefore accelerated a cost reduction programme in 
response to a downturn in trading conditions. This has resulted in the loss of approximately 160 staff, 
or 7% of our workforce, and the closure of 6 of our smaller sites. 2014/15 saw the completion 
of our service contract with Siemens that had run for 17 years. This contract will not be renewed. 
Despite this, we had a strong performance in our service sector and post period end completed 
the acquisition of service business Medical Imaging Resources (MIR), better placing us to capitalise 
on the opportunities that arise from the Affordable Healthcare Act in the USA. Also since year end 
we have formed an exciting joint venture between our Omicron business and Scienta Scientific AB 
to create the world’s largest player in the highly specialised ultra high vacuum (UHV) surface 
science field. We continue to focus on our evolution strategy to produce the tools that can 
exploit the ongoing convergence of science.

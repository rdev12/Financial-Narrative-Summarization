 Strategy and Objectives
Creston’s strategy remains to grow
both organically and through selective
acquisitions to become a substantial,
diversified, international marketing
services group.  This strategy will be
achieved by acquiring companies with
a record of strong organic growth and
management who are committed to
further growth as part of the Creston
Group of companies.  It is the Board’s
objective that each element of the
Group will reflect the continued trend
away from mass marketing and
towards one-to-one marketing
between clients and customers. 
The Board believes that an important
part of this strategy is to avoid over-
concentration in any one part of the
marketing services sector, thereby
minimising risk.  Creston will consider
acquisitions across the marketing
services disciplines including market
research, direct marketing, customer
relationship marketing (“CRM”) and
digital marketing.  We will also
consider companies that have strong
track records within more cyclical
sectors such as above-the-line
advertising, but only where they meet
our strict acquisitions criteria, which
has been the key to our success.
Our robust business model, is very
different to that of the large trade
groups, and is the key to Creston’s
ability to continue to outperform 
the market. Creston’s acquisition
criteria are: 
! Growth companies
Creston buys established
businesses with proven 
growth histories and credible
business plans. 
! Committed vendors
Creston will not consider
companies where the vendors want
an immediate exit although it is
sensitive to life stage issues.  The
Board prefers to harness the
entrepreneurial skills of vendors to
work together to grow Creston.
! Creston equity - an important part
of retaining vendor loyalty
Creston stock forms a meaningful
part of the consideration and helps
bind vendors’ and Creston’s
ambitions together. 
! Creston operating board
Creston harnesses the
entrepreneurial talents of the
acquired company management
through representation on the
Operating Board. This reviews
overall strategy, performances and
synergy opportunities and reports
to the Creston Plc Board.

dividend will be paid on 2 August
2004, subject to shareholder
approval at the forthcoming AGM of
the Company, to shareholders on the
register at the close of business on 2
July 2004.
The Board intends to maintain its
progressive dividend policy,
recognising the importance to
shareholders of dividends as well as
share price growth.  It is the intention
of the Board to pay interim dividends
in future subject to satisfactory
financial performance and prudent
cash management.  This year’s final
dividend represents a 29 per cent
increase on last year reflecting this
policy.
Employees
After another year of growth, the
Group now has 269 employees,
compared to 210 last year, in seven
locations in the United Kingdom –
Bath, Bristol, London (two), Swindon,
Westerham and Winchester.
I would like to welcome the staff of
Nelson Bostock Communications
Limited who joined the Group in
October 2003.  I would also like to
congratulate the directors and staff
across the Group who have been
responsible for such excellent
results, particularly when set against
the market and our competitors. 
In order to maintain the enthusiasm
of the staff it is proposed that we
create an employee Sharesave
Scheme and an Enterprise
Management Incentive Scheme,
proposals for both will be put to the
AGM for approval.
Prospects
The Board believes that Creston has
established a robust business model
and is confident of the Group's future
prospects.  I look forward to reporting
to you next year on what I expect to
be a further year of strong growth,
both organically and by acquisition.

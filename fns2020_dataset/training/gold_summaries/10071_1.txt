Acquiring good quality 
manufacturing businesses, 
making operational 
improvements, realising 
shareholder value at the 
appropriate time and then 
returning this value to 
shareholders continue to 
be the components of the 
“buy, improve, sell” business 
strategy that Melrose has 
followed since being founded  
in 2003. 
The Group now consists of Brush, the  
last remaining business from the FKI 
acquisition, and the businesses which 
comprise Elster. Continued improvement  
of all these businesses is, as ever, a key 
objective for 2015. 
Acquisitions and disposals during  
the year
2014 has been another highly successful 
year for Melrose. In October 2014, Elster 
Gas completed the acquisition of Eclipse,  
a US-based manufacturer of gas 
combustion components and systems for 
industrial heating and drying applications. 
Combining this with our existing Elster Gas 
business gives us a great opportunity to 
create significant shareholder value. In the  
following month, Melrose completed the 
disposal of Bridon for a total enterprise  
value of £365 million, representing the  
latest step in realising value from the FKI 
businesses acquired by Melrose in 2008.
Outlook
Overall market conditions remain 
challenging but we have in Elster a 
business that is well positioned for growth  
in 2015. At current exchange rates we face 
further currency headwinds this year and 
the order intake pattern suggests a more 
pronounced weighting of results to the 
second half of the year. As said previously, 
we believe we will see further progress in 
our Elster businesses but end market 
conditions mean that Brush will have a 
more difficult 2015. Overall, adjusting for 
the adverse currency movements which 
are outside our control, we believe that the 
Group will be in line with management 
expectations for 2015.

 Chairman’s statement
Positive results
Summary
Your Board is pleased to report a set of 
encouraging results for 2015 which reflects 
the reduced risk profile of the Group and a 
focus on increasing the capital available to 
the Group to fund a number of advantageous 
acquisitions of corporate members. 
Accordingly the profits before tax, goodwill 
and impairment for the year were £609,000 
(2014: £1,351,000), whilst the adjusted net 
asset value of the Group (Humphrey’ s 
Valuation) has increased to £1.97 per share 
(2014: £1.72) – an increase of 15%.
Helios has been reducing its exposure to the 
underwriting risk on the portfolio for the last 
two years and this reduction is reflected in 
the reduction in profitability this year . Underwriting 
profits of £1.4m (2014: £0.7m) have been ceded 
to reinsurers. In addition the premiums paid for 
Stop Loss cover increased by £300,000.
The net aggregate contribution made from 
acquiring companies at above and below fair 
value reduced from £785,000 to £108,000 
reflecting the more competitive environment 
for the buying of corporate members. The 
Board is committed to being selective on 
the acquisitions made in the future.
• Adjusted net asset value 
increases 15% to £1.97p per 
share (£1.72p) 
• Six acquisitions in 2015 
adding £6.3m of capacity 
to 2015 underwriting year 
– 31% increase
• Two acquisitions agreed 
in 2016 adding £4.6m of 
capacity to 2016 underwriting 
year – 16% increase
• 5.0p per share total 
dividend payable (2014: 5.1p)
Acquisition strategy continues to build the 
fund of capacity.

Strategy
We have continued to implement our strategy 
of building the portfolio of syndicate capacity. 
During the year the key developments were:
 » The profit for the year reflects the 
additional reinsurance cover bought to 
reduce the group exposure to large losses.
 » We have changed the accounting policy 
relating to the amortisation of capacity 
value to hold the capacity at fair value 
in the balance sheet in the future.
 » The management team has been 
strengthened by the appointment 
of an experienced Finance Director, 
Arthur Manners.
Capacity acquired
During the year a further six corporate members 
were acquired that increased the capacity for 
2013 to 2015 years of account, and a further 
two corporate members have been bought 
since 31 December 2015, adding a further 
£4.6m of capacity to the open years. These 
companies have increased the capacity 
underwritten on 2013 to 2016 underwriting 
years as shown below.
2                  Helios Underwriting plc  Annual report and financial statements 2015 These acquisitions in 2015 and 2016 to date 
were purchased for a total consideration of 
£11m, of which £3m was satisfied by the 
issue of new shares to certain vendors. We 
continue to grow and manage the quality of 
the portfolio of participations on the leading 
Lloyd’s syndicates. 
Underwriting result
The calendar year profits for 2015 have 
been generated from profits recognised in the 
portfolio from the 2013 and 2014 underwriting 
years. During 2015, the 2013 underwriting 
year mid-point estimates increased from 8.1% 
return on capacity to a final result of 14.1%. The 
mid-point estimate for the 2014 underwriting 
year is currently 8.7% and this year has made 
a healthy contribution to the 2015 result. 
As expected, the 2015 underwriting result has 
not made a significant contribution during the 
first 12 months but given the benign claims 
environment for the 2015 underwriting year 
to date, it should provide additional 
recognised profits for the next two 
financial years.
Capacity value
The Board has taken the view that it is 
appropriate to carry the value of the capacity 
acquired on the balance sheet at fair value 
at the date of acquisition. The building of a 
portfolio of participations on leading Lloyd’s 
syndicates remains the strategic objective. 
Therefore the Board decided that it was not 
appropriate to amortise the cost of the capacity 
acquired and instead to change the accounting 
policy to include an impairment test will be 
carried out at each reporting date to assess 
whether the current value exceeds the value 
carried in the balance sheet. The 2014 results 
have been restated for this accounting policy.
Reinsurance 
The proportion of the portfolio supported by 
the reinsurance market has increased and 
now the participants in the panel include private 
capital. By broadening the access to the Helios 
portfolio to private capital, we have expanded 
the potential pool of capital available to support 
the growth of the portfolio in the future. We 
expect to continue to use this source of financing 
in the future.
The reinsurers assist in the financing of their 
share of the underwriting capital required for 
the corporate members by providing letters 
of credit as Funds at Lloyd’s amounting to 
£11m at 31 December 2015. 
Dividend
Following another successful year, the 
Board is pleased to recommend that the 
final dividend remains the same as last year 
at 1.5p per share which, together with a special 
dividend of 3.5p per share (2014: 3.6p), totals 
5p per share (2014: 5.1p). The special 
dividend equates to approximately 20% of 
the 1.8m cash released from the 2013 year 
of account. These dividends will be payable to 
shareholders on the register on 10 June 
2016. As last year, the Board will put in 
place a Scrip Dividend Scheme to give 
shareholders the opportunity to elect receive 
dividends in the form of new ordinary shares 
instead of cash. If approved the dividend will 
be paid in a single payment or share issue 
on 6 July 2016.

 Amlin plc Annual Report 2010 18
Chief Executive’s review
Well positioned for growth
“ The diversity of Amlin’s business stood  
us in good stead during 2010, generating  
a ROE of 13.9% despite substantial 
international catastrophe losses and  
a challenging trading environment.”
Charles Philipps 
Chief Executive
Financial results
2010 proved a more challenging year than 2009, 
with pricing under pressure in many areas and a 
significantly	higher	level	of	claims	events.	There	
were substantial catastrophe losses, unusually 
weighted to the international catastrophe portfolio 
rather than the US, together with a higher 
incidence of large risk losses, most notably the 
Deepwater	Horizon	oil	spill.	There	was	some	
firming	of	rates	in	loss	affected	areas	such	as	
energy, although in catastrophe reinsurance the 
impact of the Chile earthquake loss on pricing 
was modest and localised. Some sectors such  
as	UK	fleet	motor	continued	to	improve,	but	with	
these few exceptions there was a general reversal 
of price increases seen in 2009 and the market was 
softened, albeit modestly, throughout the year.
Against	this	background,	the	2010	profit	before	
tax of £259.2 million, while materially less than 
our	record	2009	profit	of	£509.1	million,	still	
represents a solid result, and is a sign of the good 
underlying performance of our core Syndicate 
2001 businesses, as well as the diversity within our 
reinsurance businesses in London and Bermuda. 
The return on equity was 13.9% (2009: 37.0%).
The	increased	claims	activity	is	reflected	in	the	
higher combined ratio of 88% (2009: 72%), which 
brought the underwriting contribution down to  
£202.1 million (2009: £365.8 million). The 
investment return of 4.0% on average invested 
assets was creditable given the low interest rate 
environment, but was nevertheless also down  
on 2009 (5.9%).
Amlin	London’s	contribution	to	pre-tax	profit	was	
£143.3 million (2009: £177.5 million). Having 
incurred	significantly	more	major	catastrophe	
claims, of £132.2 million, compared with  
£22.1 million in 2009, this result demonstrates 
solid underlying performance. 
Amlin UK contributed £23.5 million (2009:  
£46.4	million),	the	lower	result	reflecting	the	
trough of the UK commercial trading cycle and 
lower	reserve	releases,	having	benefited	from	 
a one-off release of £16.0 million in 2009.
Amlin Bermuda contributed £103.4 million 
(2009:	£249.6	million)	also	reflecting	the	higher	
level of catastrophe losses of £103.9 million 
compared to £20.4 million in 2009, this business 
being predominantly a catastrophe reinsurer. 
That both Amlin Bermuda and the reinsurance 
business in Amlin London produced reasonable 
returns, despite the impact of the Chile and  
New Zealand earthquake losses, illustrates  
the geographical balance of Amlin’s 
catastrophe portfolio between international  
and US exposures as part of our overall approach 
to catastrophe underwriting.
Neither Amlin London nor Amlin Bermuda 
accrued recoveries under their new retrocessional 
reinsurance programmes which were put in place 
in 2010. These new programmes were designed 
to protect Amlin against an accumulation of 
catastrophe losses, with Amlin’s net exposure to 
a	second	and	subsequent	major	events	dropping	
progressively if the claims	from	the	first	event	or	
cumulative	losses	exceeded	pre-defined	amounts.	
With	the	2010	catastrophes	we	remained	just	
within our retention levels but would have borne 
significantly	lower	retained	net	losses	if	there	had	
been	further	major	events.	
Amlin France, which for most of 2010 included 
ACI’s former French business, suffered from 
windstorm	Xynthia	and	flooding	in	the	south	 
of France last June which reduced its contribution 
to £1.9 million (2009: £2.5 million). 
Amlin Corporate Insurance
ACI	contributed	a	profit	of	£16.6	million	(2009:	
£54.4 million), helped by a strong investment 
performance but with disappointing underwriting 
returns. The actions taken to improve underwriting 
performance in its Rotterdam marine business 
will	take	time	to	be	recognised	in	earned	figures	
and the result was also affected by worse than 
expected performance in its smaller Antwerp 
commodities cargo account.
There was concerted action throughout 2010 to 
continue re-underwriting ACI’s marine portfolio. 
This is resulting in improved trends in its hull claims 
ratios, but in its smaller cargo account softening 
market conditions have held back progress. In 
Antwerp the commodities cargo book was also  
re-priced during the second half of the year and 
into the 1 January 2011 renewals, with the high 
level	of	client	retention	reflecting	the	value	clients	
place on ACI’s specialist expertise and service 
capability in this sector. 
Re-underwriting activity has resulted in the 
non-renewal of approximately €71 million of 
marine business where pricing was considered 
inadequate and historic claims ratios unacceptable. 
Much of the remaining portfolio has better historic 
performance and more acceptable pricing.
ACI’s underwriting practices, incentive 
arrangements, risk management and reserving 
were brought more into line with Amlin and we 
strengthened management resource with the 
recruitment	of	a	Chief	Risk	Officer	and	a	Chief	
Operating	Officer,	both	of	whom	are	making	
a positive impact. ACI has also successfully 
completed the transition of services such as 
motor	fleet	claims	and	reinsurance	processing	
away from Fortis, leaving only the migration of its 
systems to Amlin’s platform, which is scheduled 
for completion in mid-2011. All of this has required

Outlook
Over-capacity continues to drive competition in 
many segments of the market, most notably in the 
US, where premium to surplus ratios in the property 
and casualty market are at a 30 year low
2
. In many 
market sectors, particularly reinsurance, downward 
pressure on pricing has increased despite the 
impact of the losses borne by the market in 2010. 
This	was	reflected	in	rate	reductions	in	January	of	
3.2% and 4.4% for our reinsurance books in Amlin 
London and Amlin Bermuda respectively. 
Amlin	benefits	from	the	diversity	of	its	portfolio,	
which gives access to a varied range of market 
conditions. For example, energy physical damage 
rates and energy liability rates have increased by 
20%	and	50%	respectively	since	the	Deepwater	
Horizon oil spill. While drilling activity in the Gulf 
of Mexico is presently low due to restrictions on 
permits, the reassessment of marine and energy 
exposures prompted by this event seems likely  
to result in demand for increased coverage 
which may exceed current market capacity 
when activity resumes. This should create 
an attractive opportunity to expand our 
underwriting in this sector. 
In the UK, we saw an improving rating trend for 
fleet	motor	at	the	end	of	2010,	following	a	more	
competitive market than expected earlier in the 
year .	This	was	reflected	in	an	overall	rate	increase	
of	7.4%	for	fleet	motor	in	January.	In	motor	fleet,	
as elsewhere in the UK commercial market, 
there	is	increasing	evidence	of	financial	distress	
as competitors withdraw or reduce capacity on 
unprofitable	business.	With	similar	trends	in	the	
personal lines market exacerbated by the impact 
of the severe winter weather in 2010, we expect 
to see improvement in pricing for UK commercial 
lines in 2011. Amlin UK is already taking advantage 
of	growth	opportunities	in	the	firmer	motor	fleet	
market and has the ability to generate further 
substantial growth as market conditions improve. 
With	the	benefit	of	these	more	favourable	trends	
combined with largely stable pricing in some other 
key sectors such as marine, Amlin’s overall portfolio, 
saw a January decline of only 1.3% in rates. 
Nevertheless, surplus capacity combined with 
the continued impact of the depressed global 
economy on premium volume, together with 
declining investment yields, is creating a challenging 
environment	in	which	to	pursue	profitable	growth.	
Amlin	is	well	positioned,	with	a	profitable	core	
portfolio supported by strong client and broker 
relationships,	as	reflected	in	our	high	retention	ratios.	
Our disciplined underwriting approach is focused 
on	profit	not	volume	and	driven	by	our	cross	cycle	
target of an average return on equity of at least 15%. 
This discipline and focus has enabled the business to 
perform well at the bottom of previous cycles. 
The	Group	is	benefiting	from	previous	investments	
in teams and acquisitions which have broadened 
the client base, distribution and market access 
of the business. We continue to anticipate 
opportunities to expand selectively through teams, 
portfolios and small acquisitions and we expect 
to add approximately £40 million of new business 
from the acquisitions of JR Clare and Lead Yacht 
Underwriters which were completed in January 
and February respectively this year. 
While	trading	conditions	also	remain	difficult	
in Continental Europe, we believe that ACI will 
benefit	from	the	improvements	made	to	its	risk	
management practices and the re-underwriting of 
its marine accounts. The Rotterdam hull portfolio, 
which was a focus of attention in late 2009 and 
early 2010, is showing signs of improvement, and 
actions taken in the Antwerp commodities cargo 
account in the second half of 2010 should have  
a positive impact on performance in 2011.
A further challenge is likely to be the substantially 
lower investment returns expected in 2011.  
Amlin will not materially increase risk appetite  
to compensate, however our proven capabilities  
in investment management, which have enabled us 
to outperform the investment return of our Lloyd’s 
peers by a simple average of 1.1% since 2005, will 
stand us in good stead to optimise available returns. 
Key highlights in 2010
 
Creation of Amlin AG and launch of Amlin Re Europe
 
Significant	progress	in	integrating	ACI
 
Completion of Solvency II pre-application preparation
 
First London Market insurer to achieve Corporate Chartered Insurer status 
 
Further investment in growth potential through senior recruitment  
and acquisitions.
Overall, while we expect market conditions 
to make 2011 another tough year, we have 
good levels of underlying performance in both 
Amlin London and Amlin Bermuda, and with an 
improving outlook for Amlin UK and the actions 
taken in ACI we expect to trade through the 
current cyclical downturn successfully.
Capital
Net tangible assets increased by 8.0% to 
£1,545.4 million in 2010, after £30.4 million 
spent on goodwill and intangibles associated with 
acquisitions and dividends paid of £102.5 million. 
We remain in a strong capital position with 
capital and available resources of £695.9 million 
in excess of our assessed capital requirements. 
As we move closer to the bottom of the cycle 
in	many	lines,	efficient	capital	management	
in support of our cross cycle goal of at least 
15% ROE becomes more critical, but with the 
introduction of Solvency II looming, it is important 
to balance this with the need for capital strength.
Our capital strength also supports our policy 
of steadily increasing the dividend, which with 
our	final	dividend	of	15.8	pence	per	share,	has	
increased by 15.0% over 2009. Allowing for this 
and the current importance of maintaining a 
more robust position than normal, we have also 
allocated up to £75 million for share buy-backs 
over the coming year. We believe that our 
prospects, both for 2011 and especially when 
better market conditions return, make it attractive 
to buy in shares at or near the current price. 
Strategy and business development
A	major	initiative	in	2010	was	the	creation	of	 
Amlin AG through the redomicile of Amlin Bermuda 
to Switzerland. On 5 May 2010 we announced 
our intention to establish Amlin Re Europe in 
Switzerland to provide the Group with access  
to European reinsurance business that does not 
typically	flow	into	the	London	and	Bermuda	market	
places.	Amlin	AG’s	incorporation	in	Zurich,	a	major	
financial	centre	and	home	of	many	global	financial	
and (re)insurance companies, will provide an ideal 
location for the further growth and expansion of 
the group’s reinsurance activities. We believe that 
Switzerland	provides	Amlin	with	strategic	flexibility,	
a strong professional workforce, a solid legal and 
regulatory environment and an improved ability  
to manage our capital.
Amlin Bermuda is now operating as a Bermuda-
based branch of Amlin AG but in all other respects 
exactly as before. Amlin Re Europe has been  
extremely well received by brokers and 
prospective clients and has made an excellent 
start in 2011, writing some €66 million of gross 
written premium, marginally above plan. With 
current pricing and the new business strain of 
incurring expenses before the development of 
earned premium, we do not expect it to make a 
material contribution in the current year. We are, 
however, excited by its longer term prospects.

Overview Strategy Performance Governance Financial statements Amlin Re Europe: investing for future growth
Amlin	Re	Europe	represents	Amlin’s	second	major	start-up	following	the	successful	
establishment of Amlin Bermuda in 2006. Continental European insurers do not readily 
buy treaty reinsurance from Lloyd’s or Bermudian reinsurers, preferring to deal with local 
reinsurers in their own language, although Amlin London already provides catastrophe 
reinsurance to some European companies. The local relationships of Amlin Re Europe’s 
experienced underwriting team, combined with Amlin’s existing reinsurance franchise, 
strong ratings and long-standing broker relationships, are already proving to be an 
attractive business proposition to the target client base. Amlin Re Europe will further 
diversify our reinsurance portfolio by geography and class and Amlin AG gives us a 
substantial European platform from which to further develop the business over time. 
Amlin’s market position as a specialist 
international insurer and reinsurer remains 
advantageous. Our business is small enough 
to	be	flexible	and	opportunistic,	able	to	shrink	
or grow individual lines according to market 
conditions, and we have excellent and long-
standing relationships with key brokers. 
Nevertheless we remain mindful of the long 
term global consolidation trend in insurance 
and the likelihood that this will be given further 
momentum	by	Solvency	II.	Major	brokers	are	
increasingly focused on streamlining their 
distribution	and	concentrating	premium	flows	
with the optimum carriers in each market 
segment.	Amlin	needs	to	have	sufficient	critical	
mass to count in this changing environment. 
During	2010,	we	continued	to	invest	in	the	 
core business, extending our underwriting scope 
and expertise through targeted recruitment. 
Given	that	one	of	our	strategic	objectives	is	for	
Amlin to be seen as ‘the place to work’, it was 
pleasing that we were able to attract a very high 
quality	cadre	of	senior	underwriters	to	join	the	
Group in 2010, mainly for Amlin Re Europe but  
also in London and Bermuda. We also further 
strengthened regional management and operational 
resources in ACI, Amlin France and Bermuda. 
We continue to see suitable acquisitions as 
important	to	our	longer	term	growth.	During	
2010 we reviewed our acquisition strategy in 
the light of valuable lessons learned from recent 
acquisitions. This is now informing our planning 
to ensure that we are fully resourced to integrate 
further acquisitions effectively in the future. 
The	Group	made	further	significant	progress	
towards Solvency II with the pre-application 
preparation completed on schedule. This was 
a	major	achievement	which	reflects	the	hard	
work and commitment of a substantial team 
of colleagues across the Group. It is becoming 
increasingly clear that Internal Model approval  
will be crucial to the success of businesses such 
as	Amlin	in	the	future	and	we	remain	confident	 
of	achieving	that	objective.	We	continue	to	expect	
that Amlin’s Target Operating Model, which is at 
the centre of our preparations for Solvency II  
( 	pp.41),	will	deliver	substantial	benefits	
and enhance Amlin’s competitive position. In 
particular, we see leading edge risk management 
as a crucial competitive advantage for the future. 
People 
Once again turnover of total employees and 
senior underwriters was low at 5.2% and 3.7% 
respectively. The stability of our employee base 
is an important asset, particularly as the business 
grows and we meet the challenge of extending the  
‘Amlin	DNA’,	which	has	been	the	foundation	of	the	 
Group’s success, across the broader business. 
Amlin’s	attainment	of	the	first	Chartered	Insurer	
status in the London Market was a resounding 
endorsement of the professionalism and expertise 
of our people and underlines our continued 
commitment to our Vision of becoming  
‘the global reference point for quality in  
each of our markets’.
Employees across the Group again showed 
teamwork, dedication and commitment to 
meet these varied demands and deliver value 
to shareholders and clients. I admire and thank 
them for their outstanding performance.

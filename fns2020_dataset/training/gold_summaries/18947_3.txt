Low & Bonar PLC
Annual Report 2015
Chairman’s 
Statement
I am very pleased to report that the Group 
has continued to progress, delivering a 
good performance against a challenging 
market backdrop.
Profit before tax, amortisation and non-recurring items from 
continuing operations increased by 5.6% to £26.6m (2014: £25.2m) 
and by 8.0% before accounting for losses in our Saudi Arabian joint 
venture. Operating margins improved from 7.7% to 8.3% during the 
year, benefiting from lower raw material costs during the first half of 
the year, improved sales mix in most of our businesses and strong 
demand in key segments. Overall demand for our products remained 
robust and reflects the diversity and strength of our niche market 
positions, products and service delivery. Sales on a constant currency 
basis increased by 2.4%.
The realignment in the Group’s operating structure during the year, 
into five Global Business Units, is being embedded and tangible 
benefits are already evident. The Group is now much better positioned 
to improve routes to market, customer intimacy and commercial 
execution, whilst leveraging efficiencies within group-wide support 
functions.
The Group has continued to invest in assets to support growth.  
Capital expenditure totalled £33.0m (2014: £19.0m) including  
£13.6m (2014: £5.3m) on the new factory build in Changzhou  
and £5.6m (2014: £0.9m) on a new non-woven geotextile factory  
in Tiszaújváros, Hungary.
Despite significant weakness of the Euro, our principal functional 
currency, the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on profits was 
broadly neutral with a higher proportion of US Dollar sales this year. 
Earnings per share before amortisation and non-recurring items (“EPS”) 
increased by 2.7% to 5.61 pence (2014: 5.46 pence). Statutory profit 
before tax from continuing operations was £12.4m (2014: £16.7m) after 
non-recurring charges of £10.1m (2014: £3.3m) and an amortisation 
charge of £4.1m (2014: £5.2m). Non-recurring charges during the year 
principally relate to the impairment of our investment in Bonar Natpet, 
our geotextile joint venture in Saudi Arabia, reflecting the significant 
downturn in market conditions within the region. Considerable 
management focus is being applied to the joint venture to minimise 
future loss and uncertainty. Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report

Low & Bonar PLC 
Annual Report 2015
To reflect the strength of these results and the Board’s 
confidence in making further progress in the coming 
year, we are proposing an increased final dividend of 
1.80 pence per share (2014: 1.75 pence). Subject to 
shareholders’ approval at the Annual General Meeting 
(“AGM”) on 31 March, the dividend will be paid on 14 
April 2016 to members registered as of 18 March 2016. 
The proposed full year dividend of 2.78 pence per  
share (2014: 2.70 pence) is covered 2.0 times (2014: 2.0 
times) by earnings before amortisation and non-
recurring items.
It is my pleasure, as always, to acknowledge the skills 
and dedication of employees throughout Low & Bonar 
who have worked hard to deliver further progress for 
the Group.
As we look to 2016, it is expected that market 
conditions in Europe will remain difficult; Middle East 
demand will continue to be subdued and possibly 
worsen; however, the marked economic slowdown in 
China is not expected to have a substantial impact on 
our sales growth in the local market. Despite these 
continuing economic headwinds, the Board is confident 
of achieving further progress. The Group is focused on 
improving its product portfolio, margins and  
geographic reach.

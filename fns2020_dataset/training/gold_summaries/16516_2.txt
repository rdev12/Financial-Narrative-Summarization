� Underground ore delivered increased by 40% compared to
the previous year.
� The underground development for the year was 24,453 
metres up from 8,720 metres achieved in the previous year.
These significant increases are the result of our on-going 
development programme.
� The Appointment of David Whittle as General Manager in 
July paved the way for  a variety of operational 
improvements, including:
- Minimising waste from development with split firing 
technique to blast the ore and waste separately; 
- The introduction of truck chutes to reduce the need 
for underground loaders; and
- The introduction of water cannons in the underground 
stopes to recover more of the fines.
� Feasibility study completed on the Rarawai power project 
by the Fiji Sugar Corporation, with VGM in negotiations to 
secure off-take agreement, or joint venture the project.

� Mineral Resource base increased by 6% to 4.2 million 
ounces, of which 790,000 ounces are classified as 
Mineral Reserves.
� Encouraging results are reported from VGM’s initial surface

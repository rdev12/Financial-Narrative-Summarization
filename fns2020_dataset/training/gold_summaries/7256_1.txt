Although the dry bulk market conditions remained challenging during 2014, our operating
results improved significantly for the year as compared to 2013. Our revenues and EBITDA
increased by 89% and 233% respectively and we achieved a 25% increase in our gross daily
time charter rate in 2014 outperforming the average Panamax and Supramax daily rates.
We have been able to continue with our fleet renewal and expansion program by taking delivery
of one Supramax vessel, our flexible chartering strategy has allowed for high fleet utilization
and we have contained our expenses by managing the fleet in a cost effective manner,
whilst maintaining our high standards of quality and safety. 
In the current depressed market environment, with the Baltic Dry Index at its lowest levels
since inception, we can trace some positive signs : the prevailing pessimism has slowed
down new building orders by 98% from its peak levels reached in 2007 and scrapping has
picked up considerably. In the first 4 months of 2015 the number of ships scrapped has almost
equaled the tonnage demolished during full year 2014. 
We all recognize that it is not lack of demand but rather oversupply, resulting from the years
of optimism, that brought the freight market to its current historical lows, therefore the
importance of slow ordering combined with record scrapping should not be
underestimated.  At the same time, we note that demand for dry bulk seaborne commodities
has been steadily increasing, although the emerging economies have been gradually
rationalizing their pace of growth in the last few years. 
In light of the above, whilst the timing of recovery is yet unclear, the lagging effect of very
few orders will at some point catch up with supply and this suggests that the supply and
demand curves are moving in the right direction, hence our optimistic view about the long
term prospects of the dry bulk market.
Going forward, we will continue to take the necessary steps to ensure that the Company
navigates safely through the current storm and is well positioned to capitalize on an improving
dry bulk market in order to maximize shareholder value.

Chief Executive’s Review
“In 2007 Wellstream
had approximately
30% of the global
offshore flexible pipe
market and was the
world’s second
largest supplier.”
2007 was a remarkable year for
Wellstream. Several records were broken
and strong foundations were set for
future growth.
Significant highlights included the strong
performance from the Newcastle
operation, on-time start up of the new
Niterói plant in Brazil, further growth of
the onshore FlexSteel
TM
business and
the launch of an installation capability
through the Seastream JV. Towards the
end of the year the Company decided to
further expand its future offshore
flexible capacity by some 40% through
an investment programme in the Niterói
and Newcastle offshore production
facilities. 
Scope of the business
With over 20 years’ experience,
Wellstream is a leading designer and
supplier of high quality unbonded
flexible pipeline products and systems.
In 2007 Wellstream had approximately
30% of the global offshore flexible pipe
market and was the world’s second
largest supplier. Our portfolio includes
dynamic risers, static flowlines, subsea
and topside jumpers, fluid transfer lines
and well service lines for use in the
offshore oil and gas market. Onshore
we produce FlexSteel™ a flexible
pipeline product. Our success is based
on strong technology supported by
continuous research and development,
excellent customer relationships and a
focus on working collaboratively with
customers and partners.
Wellstream’s core business addresses
the needs of the floating production
and subsea sectors of the offshore oil
and gas industry. This is a fast growing
segment, where deepwater applications
are becoming more common and for
which flexible pipe is often a critical
element of the development solution.
I am delighted to deliver my first Chief Executive’s Review for Wellstream as
a newly listed Public Company.

48723 MG Annual Report - Front  17/4/08  11:39  Page 5 Offshore Market Overview
Oil and gas are expected to continue as
the world’s dominant energy sources for
the foreseeable future. As many of the
more easily accessible offshore
hydrocarbon deposits have now been
discovered and produced, the industry
has to explore in progressively more
remote locations, often in deeper water
depths. This has increased the capital
intensity of the newer developments and
sparked an evolution in development
concepts from fixed platforms to floating
production facilities such as FPSO
(Floating Production, Storage and
Offloading) vessels.
Industry analysts, Infield Systems Ltd,
have estimated that capital expenditure
on deepwater developments has
increased from approximately $9bn in
2004 to $19bn in 2007. Over the next
five years, they expect this expenditure
to increase further to in excess of
$25bn per annum.
As oil companies move in to more remote
areas, and deeper water depths, the use
of floating production facilities has
become more prevalent. Flexible
pipelines are a critical element of the
majority of FPSO developments;
connecting the wellheads to the surface
via flexible risers. Thus, the increased
use of FPSOs worldwide has been one
of the drivers for rapid growth in
Wellstream’s business.

There are now approximately 200 floating
production systems in service worldwide,
of which some 60% are FPSOs.
International Maritime Associates Inc.
project that this inventory of FPSOs will
double over the next five years.
The most important regions globally for
this type of development are Latin
America and West Africa which together
account for over 40% of the global
installed base for FPSOs. The market in
Latin America dominates the worldwide
flexible market, underpinned by Brazil,
and if the potential of the major
discoveries made in the country during
2007 is realised, this trend is expected
to continue. A significant market is also
developing in Asia.
In addition to FPSOs, subsea
developments are also an important
driver for Wellstream’s business. Whilst
much of the subsea market has evolved
in support of floating production vessels
and deepwater developments, subsea
tiebacks in shallow water remain
significant, particularly in mature
production basins like the North Sea and
Gulf of Mexico. In these regions, the
current high oil and gas prices have made
the development of marginal fields
economic. Many of these developments
have been facilitated by the use of
flexible flowlines, which can be quickly
manufactured and rapidly installed using
readily available and cost effective
offshore installation vessels.
Onshore Market Overview
The onshore market in North America,
and in particular the USA, has
remained robust during 2007 as oil
companies have sought to increase
production and exploit unconventional
gas plays. A growing market for
refurbishment of existing flowline
infrastructure is also emerging.

Strategy for Growth
Wellstream aims to build a leadership
position as a supplier of bespoke
engineered flexible pipeline products for
oil companies around the world. This
leadership position will be built upon
superior customer relationships,
innovation, technology, manufacturing
and project delivery excellence.
Wellstream’s ability to deliver against
these goals rests firmly with its employees
and Wellstream therefore seeks to create
an environment of enthusiasm,
engagement and opportunity for all of
its staff. The business will deliver growth
organically and through alliances and
acquisitions that add capacity and
capability. Currently, the Company is:
 Increasing production throughput in 
Brazil and the UK
 Adding capacity in Newcastle, UK to 
reach 300 nkm/pa in 2009
 Increasing capacity in Niterói, Brazil 
to reach 270 nkm/pa in 2009
 Continuing to grow production of 
onshore flowline products
 Developing the Seastream JV focused
on installation of flexible pipelines and
risers to support Wellstream’s strategic
intent to keep the installed cost of
flexible pipe visible to end customers.

Newcastle
The centrepiece of 2007’s strong
performance was the Newcastle
manufacturing operation which
successfully met many challenges
including complexity in design,
manufacturing, testing, packaging and
shipping of flexible pipe. The capacity
at Newcastle, measured in normalised
kilometres (nkm), was upgraded at the
start of the year to 240 nkm/pa and
further upgraded mid year to 260 nkm/pa
T otal throughput of 237 nkm represented
a new annual record for the plant, being
14% ahead of 2006. The outcome
validated the ongoing focus on
continuous improvement in all facets of
the operation. 
Brazil
Undoubtedly a major 2007 milestone was
the successful commissioning of the new
plant in Niterói, Brazil in May 2007. The
Niterói plant was formally inaugurated
on 11 July 2007 with Government
representatives, Petrobras, and other
major customers and suppliers in
attendance. The ramp-up of production
at the plant progressed ahead of plan
for the remainder of the year and a
total of 52 nkm throughput was
achieved. The plant has also received
full accreditation from Petrobras. The
ramp-up of the Niterói plant exceeded
expectations and we have brought
forward the commitment to a 4 shift
system to allow 24/7 operations.
With the establishment of two manufacturing facilities for our offshore business,
the operational teams in Niterói and Newcastle are actively working on
production optimisation and taking advantage of the plants’ combined and
complementary capabilities.

Major Projects
In total 26 projects were at an execution
stage during 2007. Of particular note was
the Frade project for Chevron in Brazil.
This is a contract valued in the order of
£100m requiring the design and production
of 138km of pipes varying in size from
2 inch to 8 inch. The Frade project
accounted for some two thirds of the annual
production in Newcastle and at year end
the programme was on schedule and over
70% complete.
The year also featured eight major projects
for Petrobras. These projects involved both
the Newcastle and Niterói operations. Of
particular note was the technically complex
P52 16 inch loading line contract which
was successfully completed in July and
has now been installed offshore by the
customer. Other major contracts included
UNBC phase 1 which is the first project to
be entirely executed and manufactured in
Brazil. The UNBC projects are continuing
into 2008 where several pipe designs are
being delivered from the Niterói plant.
Of particular note was the
Frade project for Chevron in
Brazil. This is a contract
valued in the order of £100m.

Supply Chain Management
The supply chain is critical to
Wellstream’s operations with carbon
steels, alloy steels, high grade polymers,
end fittings and ancillaries being sourced
globally for our three major operations.
Overall, there have been no major
interruptions to the supply chain
throughout 2007 and we are continuing
to extend material solutions and the
vendor base. We are intensively
developing further Brazilian sources of
supply to support the Niterói plant.
A notable success has been the
introduction of the new PA12 nylon grade,
which was developed collaboratively
with Degussa. This new pipeline barrier
and shield material has achieved rapid
and widespread acceptance by our
customers and is a welcome alternative
to the previously existing nylon solution.
We have seen recent encouraging signs
in stabilisation and in some cases
reduction in raw material prices.
This is most prominent in the high value
alloy steels. 
Capacity Expansion
In November we announced capacity
expansions in both Niterói (from 150
nkm/pa to 270 nkm/pa) and Newcastle
(from 260 nkm/pa to 300 nkm/pa); a £35
million investment has been approved
for this. This is further supported by a
global continuous improvement initiative. 
The capacity expansion project has
successfully transitioned from the
definition to execution phase. Critical
activities are on track to support the
Q1 2009 operational handover. Long lead
equipment items have been ordered
and pre-construction activities for Niterói
and Newcastle are progressing well. 
In support of capacity expansion, an
accelerated reel build programme has
been progressing in both Brazil and the
UK and will run through 2008.

Wellstream places great emphasis on
Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE)
performance. In terms of key
measurables, 2007’s performance was
almost twice as effective as 2006.
Two Lost Time Incidents (LTIs) were
recorded (eight in 2006) and the OSHA
recordable rate was 1.68 (3.33 in 2006).
In order to continue this improvement
and further enhance the entire
organisation’s focus on safety, new
initiatives have been launched that
concentrate on leading HSE indicators
and the behavioural aspects of safety.
In 2007 the Company embarked upon
a programme of change - “Journey to
Zero”. The driver for this change has
been the Company’s belief that all
accidents and incidents are preventable
and the programme ensures that this
principle is embedded within the
Company’s organisational culture.
Building on the successes of 2007, we
aim to further develop our policies and
practices. We have identified the
following objectives as being
fundamental to this goal in 2008;
 Continuous Improvement - 
Implementing lean manufacturing 
principles throughout the business
 Supply Chain Management - Engaging
with our key suppliers to assess HSE
competencies and share learning
 Percentage Safe Auditing - A daily work
routine involving a team of
Management, Operators and HSE
personnel
 Behavioural Safety Training - To
support the “Journey to Zero”
 OHSAS 18001/ISO 14001
certification - Expanding the scope to
include the Niterói plant in Brazil.

Wellstream is committed to seeking ways
to minimise avoidable harm to the
environment. In Newcastle, Wellstream
has implemented an Environmental
Management system, certified to
ISO 14001. Resource conservation and
pollution prevention principles are
integrated into our business processes,
facilities, operations and products. In
Brazil and Panama City, USA, 2008 will
see a focus on improving monitoring
and setting of targets.
The Company is in the early stages of
implementing an Energy and Waste
Management Programme. This
encompasses auditing, further definition
of waste production and the carbon
footprint. The intention is to further refine
reduction targets and recycling initiatives.

Our 20 year relationship with Petrobras
has been further enhanced by the
opening of the plant in Niterói, Brazil.
18 | Chief Executive’s Review
This has already begun to benefit the
business by facilitating greater
co-operation in terms of collaborative
capacity planning, product qualification
and technology development. Key
commitments have been received from
Petrobras for 2008.
The Niterói plant has also supported
other Wellstream customers such as
Devon Energy, Chevron, Anadarko and
StatoilHydro, all of whom have projects
that were executed in 2007 or will be
manufactured in 2008. 
In total this customer support translated
into a backlog at 31 December 2007 of
£335.9m.
Seastream and the Pyrenees project
On 3 July 2007, BHP Billiton awarded
Wellstream and its Seastream Joint
Venture, contracts for its Pyrenees
project offshore Western Australia.
The contracts involve the supply and
installation of flexible flowlines and risers
and installation of the subsea
infrastructure and the Floating Production
Storage and Offloading vessel (FPSO).
The value of these contracts is in excess
of £100m and represents a significant
milestone for both Wellstream and the
Joint Venture. At the end of the year
preparations were well underway from
a new operating centre in Perth, Australia
for the offshore programme which is due
to commence in early 2009. The pipe
manufacturing programme will
commence in Newcastle in mid 2008 and
the project team is overseeing an
extensive engineering, procurement and
manufacturing preparedness programme.
At year end we also received a
commitment from Devon Energy for
remedial installation work on the Polvo
field in Brazil. The offshore work was
completed in February 2008.

With the upturn in activity, global
staff numbers have grown from
715 at 31 December 2006 to 945 at
31 December 2007.
Organisation
The principal growth has been in
Brazil with the start-up of the new
plant and associated operations. The
smooth start-up in Niterói has been
facilitated by an intensive induction
and training programme which
included the placement of Brazil
employees in the UK in the first half
of the year and the deployment of
several UK and US based specialists
in Niterói to assist with knowledge
transfer in the second half of the year. 
Following flotation, an SAYE scheme
was made available to UK employees
with 79% of the eligible UK workforce
participating. This has had a positive
effect and has raised the sense of long
term involvement in the Company’s
future. To further emphasise this, at
year end a 3 year pay agreement has
been concluded with the Newcastle
workforce.
The success of the Company was
recognised locally and nationally in
the UK. Wellstream became North
East of England Company of the Year
at the North East Business Awards. In
November, Wellstream received the
UK Company of the Year award from
the British Chamber of Commerce. 
ERP system
2007 also saw the start-up of a
company wide Enterprise Resource
Planning (ERP) project. The intention
is to replace stand-alone systems,
spreadsheets and databases that have
served their purpose to date, with a
new integrated system.
T echnology R&D
We have an extensive R&D
programme designed to meet
customer and market needs and to
create and commercialise new
designs and solutions. Full-scale test
and qualification work for customer-
funded programmes are now being
scheduled out to 2011.
During 2007 our strategic programme
has included completion of a high
pressure deepwater riser qualification.
As a result of the qualification
requirements there are a number of
full-scale tests such as burst, tension
and dynamic cycling of complete
riser structures to demonstrate the
performance against industry
standards. Each flexible riser is a
complex non-bonded structure
comprising polymers, metals, structural
tapes and end terminations. These
layers all interact with one another and
the testing ensures that during service
no unacceptable wear, cracks or
breaks occur within the structure.
Completion of the 540 bar design adds
to the qualification envelope and also
provides invaluable performance
data as even more challenging
service requirements are considered.
It is important to continue to enhance
the knowledge base of materials
technology even for existing materials.
Industry requirements for service in the
order of 25 years mean that fatigue
testing to demonstrate performance
in excess of 250 years is required.
Significant investment continues to
be made in the fatigue testing of 
pressure and tensile armour materials
under differing environmental
conditions enhancing the customer’s
confidence in the predictive lifetime of
a riser in very challenging conditions.
As increasing numbers of offshore
fields are turning to “sour service”,
where the oil is strongly composed of
contaminants like hydrogen sulphide,
a major materials test programme
has been undertaken to validate the
permeable characteristics of all our
polymers used as an internal fluid
barrier for this application.

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Wellstream implements a
performance management system
throughout the business. At the
start of every year the critical
success factors are reviewed and
key performance indicators are set
for the Group. The Board approves
these KPI targets and monitors and
assesses performance against these 
throughout the year. These KPIs are
cascaded throughout the business
and more detailed KPIs are also
created that align with geographical
centres and business functions.
These KPIs drive the appropriate
focus in the Group and the top 6
KPIs for 2007 were as follows;
(1) EBITDA is defined on page 30 in the
Financial Review.
(2) Offshore Gross Margin measures the
profitability of project production in the
year. It is calculated by deducting
material and transportation costs from
revenue on a contract by contract basis.
(3) On-time material receipts are important
in ensuring minimal interruption to
production. We measure any delay to the
planned production that results directly
from delayed material receipts and this is
calculated as a proportion of production
hours available.
(4) Throughput is measured in normalised
kilometres. It is a measure of capacity
utilisation.
(5) The lodging of patents is important
because it allows for protection of
intellectual property. The filing of an
application by our patent agent with the
UK Patent Office (or patent offices in
other jurisdictions) is an important step
and is therefore treated as a KPI.
(6) Offshore orders are the value of future
revenue added to backlog on receipt of a
customer order. It is a measure of the
rate at which we win new business.

Risks and Uncertainties
Since Wellstream is a technologically
complex business operating in a
challenging industry, risk management is
a key facet of day-to-day management.
48723 MG Annual Report - Front  17/4/08  11:40  Page 24 Wellstream Holdings PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2007 | 25
At an operational level there are strict
processes in place to review risks and
uncertainties during the bidding process
and during engineering, procurement,
manufacturing, testing and post-delivery
project phases. Risk assessments are
performed on a project-by-project
basis and the operations are reviewed
monthly through formal processes.
At the corporate level, the Executive T eam
in Wellstream regularly performs a risk
mapping exercise which is reviewed
with the Board and the Audit Committee.
This includes an assessment of
operational, financial, strategic,
compliance and environmental risks.
This risk mapping exercise is extensive
as is the tracking of mitigating actions.
Key risks highlighted include:
Petrobras is a key customer
of Wellstream
Petrobras commands a significant
proportion of Wellstream’s business. The
demand for flexible pipe is progressively
defined as part of a continuous dialogue
between the two companies. Regular
and open review meetings establish
capacity availability and Petrobras’
offshore field development priorities. 
Wellstream continues to diversify the
customer base both in Brazil (where
international oil companies are
increasingly active) and internationally.
Senior Management and key
personnel
Experienced and qualified personnel
are in high demand in the oil and gas
industry. It is important for Wellstream to
maintain a close focus on both retention
and effective recruitment of key
personnel at a time of growth. Actions to
support this include detailed succession
planning, regular remuneration reviews,
industry benchmarking, improved
employee welfare arrangements and
careful career development.
Single source vendors in the
supply chain
Wellstream’s supply chain is critical to
the operation and for certain material
types there are sole source vendors. In
addition, for the materials that are
imported into Brazil, the supply chain is
long and time consuming. These
challenges are mitigated by having a
clear supply chain strategy in place,
careful maintenance of stocking
programmes, constant vigilance of
vendor performance, the development
of commercial risk and reward
arrangements and, where appropriate,
the establishment of effective long term
vendor frame agreements.

Customer concentration 
Wellstream’s business is founded on
a relatively small number of high value
customers including Petrobras. If
requested project lead times from
these customers change significantly,
revenue and margin performance
could be put at risk. In order to
mitigate this, Wellstream continues to
broaden its customer base, develop
new relationships in selected regions
and apply the principle of focused
account management to its
strategically targeted customer base.
Product mix 
During the sales and business
development process, Wellstream
strives to influence product mix to
manufacturing friendly solutions but it
is not always possible to achieve an
optimal outcome. Poor product mix
can affect throughput and hence
revenue and margin performance. 
To mitigate this exposure Wellstream
constantly manages the “funnel” of
incoming work and encourages
standardisation of its pipe structures
during project planning phases. In
addition it is always the aim to gain
sufficient margins on projects that have
more challenging product scopes.
Volatility of the oil and gas industry 
The price of oil and gas and levels of
business confidence across oil and gas
markets are key drivers for Wellstream’s
business. The trends towards the use
of deepwater, floating production and
subsea technologies are also important.
A sustained and significant reduction in
oil and gas prices and/or a reduction
in business confidence could have an
adverse impact on the level of customer
spending. To mitigate this exposure
Wellstream strives to maintain in-depth
market intelligence, to gather and use
client feedback and to plan capacity,
throughput and its cost base so that any
downturn can be weathered effectively.
Seastream initiative
The risk profile of offshore installation
of flexible pipe is significantly different
to that of design and manufacturing
activity. Recognising that this is a
newly developing business stream for
Wellstream, great care has been taken
to negotiate acceptable risk profiles
on projects as they are secured.

Corporate Social Responsibility
Local involvement is at the very heart of
Wellstream’s social responsibility programme.

Corporate Social Responsibility
Wellstream is focussed on working in
partnership with all elements of our
communities - education, charities, local
organisations, support groups, business
and the public sector.
On a routine basis Wellstream actively
works with clients on project specific
HSE Performance Recognition Schemes
where HSE ‘best practice’ is rewarded
with a charitable donation. In 2007,
PetroSA’s Southern Gas Field project,
in which Wellstream was involved,
generated a donation to two South
African schools.
Local involvement is at the very heart of
Wellstream’s social responsibility
programme; such involvement can be
seen in Wellstream’s support of the local
Walker Central Junior Football Club in
Newcastle upon Tyne, UK to which in
2007 Wellstream donated £10,000. 
The Company has a specific budget for
community involvement activities.
Of the budget set aside for charitable
giving, a proportion is given to charities
with which the Company has formed
partnerships, such as St Oswald’s
Hospice (UK), Santa Clara Project (Brazil)
and United Way (USA). 
Many of our employees give generously
of their money, time and energy and
in support of their efforts; Wellstream
operates a charitable giving policy
whereby the Company matches
the monies raised up to a set limit by
any employee. 
Ethical Trading Policies
Wellstream has a robust business
conduct policy that ensures the
Company trades legally, fairly, openly,
honestly and with transparency in all
dealings. The policy is highly visible and
governs the actions of all employees in
the conduct of Wellstream’s business
and in respect of the Company’s
dealings with customers, suppliers,
clients, contractors and intermediaries.
The Company’s business conduct policy
covers gifts and hospitality, international
business relationships, conflicts of
interest, confidential information and
the reporting of misconduct.
The Company is committed to following
a stringent fraud and anti-corruption
policy to ensure all business is
conducted in a legal, fair and honest
manner. This policy governs the actions
of all employees and is accessible to all;
the Company will not tolerate fraud,
corrupt, dishonest or illegal activity
amongst employees, customers,
suppliers or intermediaries. 
Wellstream also operates under the
guidance of a whistle blowing policy.

course of action an employee should
take if they have concerns. All policies
are available to view on the website.

Outlook
Looking ahead, we will continue to apply
ourselves to maintain our strong
throughput and ensure we deliver against
our targets for investment in capacity
expansion. This investment will boost
total capacity by some 40% in 2009.
The long term industry fundamentals
remain strong and we continue to see
growth opportunities across all aspects
of our business.

Annual Report 2009
Chief Executive’s Review
Business review
I am pleased to report that Ceres 
Power has had another successful 
year despite the challenging business 
environment. The Group has made 
substantial progress in key areas and 
successfully delivered all of the 
objectives that we set out in last year’s 
Annual Report.
Residential CHP products
In May 2009, the Group announced 
the successful design, build and test of 
1kW grid-connected Alpha Combined 
Heat and Power (‘CHP’) products 
meeting all of the deliverables under 
the Alpha phase of the residential CHP 
programme with British Gas. This 
important milestone was achieved 
within the timescale set out in the 
roadmap presented to the market in 
June 2008. 
The Alpha CHP products were tested on 
mains natural gas under representative 
operating conditions. During testing, 
the units produced sufficient electricity 
to meet most of a typical UK home’s 
power requirements and demonstrated 
the seamless export and import of 
power to and from the grid, as well as 
producing the heat required to meet all 
of a home’s central heating and hot 
water needs. Key tests were witnessed 
and data verified by British Gas and an 
independent gas appliance testing 
company appointed by British Gas. All 
of the Alpha CHP product requirements 
including performance, size, weight 
and regulatory compliance were 
successfully achieved. Completion  
of the Alpha phase triggered the  
£2 million Alpha milestone payment 
received in June 2009. I would like to 
thank all of the employees of Ceres 
for their hard work and commitment 
in delivering this significant milestone.
The Beta phase of the British Gas  
CHP programme is now under way  
and includes a sequence of activities 
relating to the design, procurement, 
build and trialling of Beta CHP units.  
The validation of in-field product 
performance and reliability including 
consistently high quality installation, 
service and maintenance, is a critical 
element of this phase. The refinements 
identified for product and manufacture 
from the Alpha phase testing have been 
incorporated in the Beta design phase. 
The Group is in the process of procuring 
the necessary components for testing 
and incorporation into the build of the 
initial batch of Beta field trial units. The 
Beta units will be manufactured off 
representative volume-capable 
machines and processes and use 
components sourced from the  
Group’s global supply chain. 
Extensive work has been conducted in 
conjunction with British Gas engineers 
to select a representative sample of 
homes across the country for inclusion 
in the Beta field trials programme.   05
Ceres Power Holdings plc 
Annual Report 2009
Overview
The in-home surveys and site selection 
have been completed and work is 
under way to install the necessary 
monitoring equipment to capture  
and analyse the relevant data from 
the trials including room temperature, 
heat usage, home occupancy and 
electricity consumption. In addition  
to providing valuable in-field product 
validation data, the trials will enable 
the CHP control and electronics 
operating systems to be optimised 
using real world in-home data across 
a range of housing market segments. 
The trials will also be an opportunity to 
establish and optimise the associated 
service offering including the capture 
of valuable consumer feedback.
Manufacturing
In March 2009, the Group secured  
a lease on a 50,000 sq. ft. (5,000 m
2
) 
factory for the volume manufacture  
of fuel cells and assembly of Fuel  
Cell Modules. The factory is located  
in Horsham, South East England,  
within 10 miles of the Group’s existing 
facilities in Crawley. The factory fit-out 
was completed in July 2009 and it  
is anticipated that the installation  
and commissioning of volume 
manufacturing machines will be 
completed during Q3 2009 and  
initial manufacturing operations will 
commence during Q4 2009. As part  
of the Group’s de-risking strategy, the 
core mass manufacturing machines 
and processes being installed in  
the Horsham factory have been trialled 
in the Group’s pilot manufacturing 
facility in Crawley. The Horsham facility’s 
manufacturing output will be for low 
volume Beta units in 2009 and into 2010 
for sheltered field trials under the 
programme with British Gas. Additional 
equipment will be installed from 2010  
to deliver the higher volumes required 
for commercial field trials and in 
preparation for volume launch  
with British Gas in H2 2011.
Ceres has entered into a long-term 
supply agreement with Daalderop BV, 
a well-established domestic heating 
appliance manufacturer. The 
company, based in the Netherlands, 
has a strong presence in the Benelux 
region and also supplies the German 
and UK markets. The boiler assembly 
will be manufactured in volume by 
Daalderop in accordance with Ceres 
Power’s complete CHP product design. 
Daalderop provides Ceres with a 
cost-effective volume condensing 
boiler assembly capability, brings 
supply chain relationships for the 
standard boiler components, extensive 
gas appliance engineering expertise, 
a strong brand and established 
channels into the European market. 
We are delighted to have secured this 
long-term agreement with Daalderop. 
To support the on-going product 
engineering and manufacturing 
scale-up activities, Ceres is continuing 
In January 2009, the Group secured a  
£2.5 million funded development, supply  
and distribution agreement with Calor Gas 
Limited in the UK for residential CHP products 
operating on liquefied petroleum gas.
to invest significant time and resources 
across its global network of supply chain 
partners for raw materials, engineered 
balance of plant components, 
manufacturing process machinery  
and test equipment.
Operations
During the year the Group has made 
significant investments in both capital 
equipment and also human capital.  
The Group has recruited experienced 
engineers to support the scale-up for  
the Beta and Gamma phases of the 
British Gas programme and towards 
market launch. The Group has recruited 
approximately 30 new staff in 
manufacturing, product development, 
supply chain management and product 
testing. This investment will help ensure 
that the Group delivers a cost-effective 
and reliable CHP product. 
The Group is also investing in the 
infrastructure to support the planned 
growth of the business. Group-wide 
Enterprise Resource Planning  
and Quality systems are being 
implemented and we have brought 
in-house a dedicated personnel 
function to support and develop  
the growing workforce. The Group 
continues to make significant 
investments in the development, 
capture and management of a 
substantial intellectual property (‘IP’) 
portfolio including patents, trademarks 
and know-how. The Group has unique  06

continued
IP and it is essential that this continues  
to be well protected and the Group 
maximises value through its 
commercial exploitation.
Commercial
In January 2009, the Group secured a 
major new development, supply and 
distribution agreement with Calor Gas 
Limited (‘Calor’). Under this agreement, 
Calor is paying £2.5 million towards  
the costs of developing and trialling 
residential CHP products operating on 
liquefied petroleum gas (‘LPG’). Calor 
will make milestone payments to Ceres 
during the development and trialling 
phase, and has already made an 
up-front payment of £1 million. Ceres 
has also secured a volume call-off 
order from Calor for 20,000 Ceres LPG 
CHP products in aggregate over a 
five-year period for the UK market. 
Subject to successful completion of 
the development and trialling phase,  
and agreeing standard commercial 
terms, Ceres Power will sell the Ceres 
LPG CHP product to Calor for the UK 
market on an exclusive basis for a 
five-year period, anticipated to  
begin in 2012. 
Ceres and Calor intend to maximise 
sales of the Ceres LPG CHP product by 
addressing both the existing LPG 
customer base and also the substantial 
number of homes and small businesses 
using oil, solid fuel or conventional 
electrical heating (more than two 
million in the UK alone). Calor is the  
UK’s leading LPG supplier with over  
70 years experience and its parent 
company, SHV Gas, is the world’s 
largest distributor of LPG with 
operations spanning 27 countries  
over three continents. Ceres Power 
retains the right to supply and distribute 
Ceres LPG CHP products anywhere  
in the world outside the UK and the 
right to exploit its innovative fuel cell 
technology in other applications 
globally, including in the UK. There  
are more than 100 million properties 
without access to mains gas across 
Europe, representing a substantial 
growth opportunity for Ceres.
Ceres Power’s unique fuel cell 
technology provides significant 
opportunities for residential CHP 
products globally including Europe,  
Asia and North America. The Group  
is exploring options in all these 
geographies, with particular  
near-term focus on Europe given  
the potential synergies and  
similarities with the CHP product 
developed for the UK market. 
Financial
During the last 12 months the global 
financial system has been under 
extreme pressure. As we reported in 
the interim results, the Group’s Board-
approved treasury policy has focused 
on preserving the Group’s capital 
base by investing in low-risk, high

quality investments. I am pleased to 
report that this risk management 
policy has enabled the Group to avoid 
any financial investment losses. 
Commercial revenue for the year 
increased by 32% to £1.0 million (2008: 
£0.7 million) due to the successful 
completion of the Alpha phase of the 
CHP programme with British Gas and  
the completion of the contract with EDF 
Energy Networks. As noted in the interim 
results, the first milestone payment of  
£1.0 million from British Gas in February 
2008 has been recognised as revenue 
spread over the Alpha phase. 
In June 2009, following the completion 
of the Alpha phase with British Gas, the 
Group received the second milestone 
payment of £2.0 million. During the  
year the Group also received the first 
milestone payment of £1.0 million under 
the new commercial contract with 
Calor. In accordance with the Group’s 
accounting policy, these up-front cash 
payments are being recognised as 
revenue spread forward over the 
development and trialling phases  
of each contract based on the costs 
incurred. Other operating income 
arising from public sector contracts fell 
to £0.5 million (2008: £0.8 million). 
Operating costs for the year increased 
by 35% to £10.7 million (2008: £7 .9 million). 
This increase reflects the recruitment  
of experienced staff in product 
engineering, manufacturing and 
procurement and the expenditure in 
the supply chain to co-develop and 
procure CHP components. Included  
in operating costs is a non-cash 
share-based payments charge of  
£0.6 million (2008: £0.6 million) which 
includes the effect of the new 
medium-term incentive schemes 
approved by shareholders at the AGM 
in December 2008. Finance income of 
£1.0 million (2008: £1.0 million) was in 
line with the prior year, with the fall in 
interest receivable of £0.1 million offset 
by the increase in fair value of the 
Company’s investment in short-dated 
UK Government gilts.
The loss for the financial year rose by 60% 
to £8.0 million (2008: £5.0 million) 
reflecting the costs of the Alpha phase 
and the investment in scaling-up the 
Group’s engineering and manufacturing 
operations ahead of the Beta phase.
The Group’s net cash and financial 
assets fell by £4.5 million (2008: £16.3 
million increase) during the year to  
£23.0 million (2008: £27.5 million). This 
reduction primarily arose due to the 
loss for the financial year of £8.0 million 
(2008: £5.0 million), adjusted for 
non-cash items of £1.5 million (2008: 
£1.4 million), and the cash investment 
in property, plant and equipment  
of £2.1 million (2008: £1.1 million)  
partly offset by the decrease in 
working capital of £3.9 million

British Gas CHP programme Beta phase
Following the successful completion of 
the Alpha phase of the residential CHP 
programme with British Gas, the Beta 
phase is now under way. The Beta 
phase is designed to validate in-field 
product performance and reliability, 
including installation, service and 
maintenance through sheltered field 
trials and commercial field trials in 
selected consumers’ homes. 
Using British Gas engineers to conduct 
in-home surveys, a representative 
sample of homes across the country 
has been selected for inclusion in the 
Beta trials. Work is now under way to 
install the necessary monitoring 
equipment to capture and analyse the 
relevant data from the trials. The data 
will provide valuable information to 
enable the CHP product’s operating 
cycle to be optimised using real-world 
in-house data as well as to help inform 
the marketing strategy to address  
both ‘early adopter’ and mass  
market customers.  09

Overview
Calor Gas residential CHP programme
In January 2009, Ceres Power signed a 
major new agreement with Calor Gas 
Limited (‘Calor’) to develop and 
distribute residential CHP products 
operating on liquefied petroleum gas 
(‘LPG’). Under the terms of the 
agreement, Calor is paying £2.5 million 
towards the cost of developing and 
trialling the Ceres LPG CHP product. 
Ceres Power has also secured a volume 
call-off order from Calor for 20,000 Ceres 
LPG CHP products in aggregate over a 
five-year period for the UK market, 
anticipated to begin in 2012.
Calor is the UK’s leading LPG supplier 
and its parent company, SHV Gas, is the 
world’s largest distributor of LPG. Within 
Europe there are more than 100 million 
properties that are off mains gas and 
more than 2 million in the UK alone.
(2008: £1.2 million). The reduction in 
working capital has been driven by the 
increase in deferred income due to 
the receipt of milestone payments of 
£2.0 million and £1.0 million from British 
Gas and Calor respectively and the 
increase in trade payables relating to 
the procurement of plant and 
machinery due for delivery after the 
year end. 
The Group’s liquidity position remains 
sound with £23.0 million in net cash  
and financial assets. All surplus funds 
are invested in UK Government  
gilts, short-term low-risk ‘AAA’-rated 
money market funds and short-term 
bank deposits.
Outlook
The Board and senior management 
are focused on the delivery of  
our core residential CHP programmes 
and on investing in the operational 
capabilities that will underpin our 
future growth. To achieve the Group’s 
core objectives our priorities for the 
next 12 months are to:
commence initial manufacturing  >
operations in the Horsham fuel cell 
mass manufacturing facility;
complete design, procure and   >
build stages of the Beta phase of 
the CHP programme with British Gas 
including formal regulatory 
certification of the CHP product;
conduct testing of mains natural gas  >
Beta CHP units in both sheltered field 
trials and initial commercial trials in 
consumers’ homes; and
secure additional commercial  >
relationships with go-to-market 
channel partners internationally.
I look forward to reporting on the 
delivery of our stated priorities  
and other progress over the next  
12 months.

Chief Executive’s Review
During 2009 Ideal Shopping Direct made a successful return  
to profitability with business performance improving steadily 
through the year. 2009 started with the UK in recession and the 
Company having limited cash resources, with declining sales 
and a rapidly increasing overhead base.
During the first half of 2009 plans were implemented that 
reduced overheads and made them more variable with sales. 
We also looked to improve the customer experience by 
changing the organisational infrastructure in respect of our call 
centres and product delivery. In our call centres we focused  
on restoring ‘real people’ to answer our customer calls, where 
previously there had been a drive to automated answering 
systems. Furthermore, we invested in Numero Customer 
Management Software which significantly improved our 
customer service in the area of e-mail processing. With regard 
to product delivery, we increased the speed of delivery to the 
customer and introduced track and trace technology to give 
visibility to the delivery process. I believe that both these 
developments were appreciated by our customers and we  
saw increased customer spend in the second half year. 
Also during the first half, the business was managed more 
effectively. Tight financial controls were implemented across the 
organisation and a review of the supply chain led to changes in 
the way product was supplied into the business. Rather than 
committing to stock in advance of TV shows on a firm sale 
basis, the majority of our sales are now generated with products 
sourced on a sale or return basis. This has removed risk from 
the business and released cash. At the start of 2009 we had 
relatively high stock levels and there was a clear need for a 
reduction. The business initiated a ‘sale strategy’ in January  
and February 2009 to clear stocks at planned reduced margins. 
This will not be necessary in 2010 and our stock levels are some 
£1.5 million lower at the end of 2009 than the previous year.

Business Review
Having reached the half year with flat sales compared with  
the previous year, and an underlying loss before tax and non 
underlying items of £0.95 million, there was a clear need to drive 
sales performance. Having improved the customer experience 
and focused on sourcing some excellent product for the 
Christmas selling period, sales increased by 18.5% in the 
second half, driven by a number of focused initiatives, which 
included the following:
a series of best practice direct mail techniques were •	
introduced to stimulate sales from our valuable customer 
databases
investments were made in people and software to improve •	
our websites through better search, navigation, presentation 
and availability
our products and on-screen presentation techniques were •	
improved with a comprehensive trading plan to maximise 
sales in the run up to Christmas.
For the year, sales increased by 9.2% to £103.3 million with 
home and leisure being the most successful categories showing 
growth of 27.5% with sales reaching £48.4 million. We have 
successfully started to increase the spend per basket of our 
customers through the introduction of some higher priced items. 
This has been helped by our Flexi-pay proposition, which we 
have extended from telephone sales to internet sales and I am 
pleased to be able to report that our bad debt exposure from 
Flexi-pay is minimal.
We have continued to make progress with the Craft category 
and sales are up 7.4% during 2009. In 2010 we will separate 
Craft into a new division to ensure increased focus on this area, 
which remains a strategic priority for the management team.  
In July 2009 a test was started with a daily, morning Craft 
broadcast live on Freeview Channel 36. After a successful test 
period this initiative was implemented permanently in October 
2009. The Create and Craft club membership continues to grow 
demonstrating the loyalty of our customers to the Create and 
Craft proposition. 08 Ideal Shopping Direct Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Chief Executive’s Review continued
“Progress is being made with 
the Create and Craft brand 
which we believe has 
international potential.
We are actively looking at new 
product categories, such as 
gardening, that we believe can 
be developed in a similar way.”
Future prospects 
The scale of the business turnaround since 2008 has been 
significant and the management team are excited about the 
growth prospects for the Company. The strategy, set out in 
2009, of developing niche, internet based propositions that 
can be complemented by a unique TV shopping experience, 
is working. Progress is being made with the Create and Craft 
brand which we believe has international potential. In addition 
we have made great progress with the gardening category 
and during 2010 we intend to fully integrate Lead The Good 
Life Limited into the business. We are actively looking at new 
product categories that we believe can be developed in a 
similar way.
For the core TV shopping proposition, there continues to be  
a number of opportunities for development. The roll out of 
digital TV across the UK brings new customers every day and 
we are focused on the business qualities of customer service, 
entertainment and excellent products that will grow our 
customer base. The reinstatement of supplier credit insurance 
at the start of 2010 enables us to offer an increasingly broader 
range of products.
The successful implementation of initiatives that are driving 
the Company forward resulted from a team effort. My 
colleagues have stepped up to the challenge of turning  
the business around and their progress to date has been 
impressive. Their continued support will be needed going 
forward as we look to reinforce our brand values of family, 
friendship and fun.

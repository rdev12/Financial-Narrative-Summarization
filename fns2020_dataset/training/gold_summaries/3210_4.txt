Earnings and operating profit numbers are stated, throughout the commentary, before exceptional items and certain re-measurements where applicable – see note 2 for definition. The Directors believe 
this measure assists with better understanding the underlying performance of the Group. The equivalent amounts after exceptional items and certain re-measurements are reflected in  
note 6 and are reconciled at Group level in the Group Income Statement. Certain re-measurements and exceptional items are described in note 8.
Adjusted earnings and adjusted basic earnings per share are reconciled to their statutory equivalents in note 13. All current financial results listed are for the 12 months ended 31 December 2008. The 
Group adopted IFRS with effect from 1 January 2005. The comparative data for 2004 has been restated accordingly. IAS 32 and IAS 39 were adopted with effect from 1 January 2005, and the 
comparative data for 2004 does not reflect the effect of these standards. 
All references to ‘the prior year’, ‘2007’ and ‘last year’ mean the 12 months ended 31 December 2007 unless otherwise specified. Throughout this Report references to British Gas include Scottish Gas.

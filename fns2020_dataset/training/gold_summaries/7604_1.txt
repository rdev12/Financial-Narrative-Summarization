Hunting PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 07 
“  Hu nt i n g h a s 
seen many of its 
facilities increase 
the number of 
production shifts 
in the year, with 
demand in 
certain areas 
of the Group 
exceeding the 
historic highs 
seen in 2008.”
Introduction
During 201 1, Hunting achieved a number 
of significant milestones in its growth strategy 
leading to the excellent financial results reported. 
The Group successfully concluded four 
acquisitions totalling £597 .9m in the second half 
of the year, which extended our technology 
offering and product reach into the oil and gas 
wellbore, while also broadening our advanced 
manufacturing capabilities offered to our 
customers. In parallel to these acquisitions, 
Hunting has continued its significant investment 
programme within its existing manufacturing 
facilities, with new sites formally opening in 
China and Scotland and further expansion 
projects commencing in North America. Within 
this positive operating environment, Hunting has 
seen many of its facilities increase the number 
of production shifts in the year, with demand in 
certain areas of the Group exceeding the historic 
highs seen in 2008.
Supporting our strategy for growth has been 
a strengthening in market momentum. In 201 1, 
worldwide rig counts increased 12% to close the 
year at a near record high of 3,612 active units. 
Accompanying this increase has been a 20% 
increase in horizontal drilling compared to 
2010 and a further shift to focusing on oil 
drilling. These factors have driven the demand 
for Hunting’s products and with the WTI oil price 
averaging US$95 per barrel in the year, which 
reflects a tight balance between supply and 
demand, the Group enters 2012 with a 
confident outlook.
Much of what Hunting has achieved in the 
year has been due to the high quality people 
we employ. Following the acquisitions, the 
Group now has 3,453 employees (2010 – 2,233). 
As part of the integration of the new businesses 
and personnel, the senior management within 
our primary operating unit, Hunting Energy 
Services, has been restructured, with the new 
positions of Chief Operations Officer, Director of 
Manufacturing, Manufacturing Analyst and a new 
Managing Director of Hunting Americas being 
created. These new positions will direct new 
initiatives to maximise the manufacturing 
efficiencies across the Group’s operations.
With this strong business momentum, particularly 
seen in the final quarter of the year, coupled with 
the business development highlighted, the Group 
reported a 44% increase in revenue to £608.8m 
(2010 – £423.3m). Our existing businesses 
contributed £120.7m to this growth, with the 
balance of £64.8m coming from our newly 
acquired companies. Profit from continuing 
operations before amortisation and exceptional 
items increased 80% to £81.0m (2010 – £45.0m) 
comprising £65.9m from existing operations and 
£15.1m from acquisitions. This performance leads 
us to report a 70% increase in diluted earnings 
per share from continuing operations before 
amortisation and exceptional items to 38.7p 
(2010 – 22.7p).
Profit from continuing operations after 
amortisation and exceptional items was 
£41.0m (2010 – £31.0m) and the reported diluted 
earnings per share from continuing operations 
was 20.3p (2010 – 15.4p).
Business Development
Hunting’s strong financial performance 
during 201 1 has been driven by an excellent 
performance from our existing businesses and a 
good contribution from the acquisitions made in 
the second half of the year. 
Hunting’s strategy is to invest in proprietary 
products, which have a strong market share and 
good synergies with the existing products offered 
by the Group. Each of the acquisitions completed 
during the year fulfilled these criteria:
Dearborn Precision Tubular Products 
(“Dearborn”) – In August 201 1, the Group 
completed the acquisition of Dearborn for a 
consideration of £50.6m. The business provides 
specialist precision machining services to the 
energy, aviation and power generation sectors, 
which demand close tolerance machining for 
components used in critical applications. 
Dearborn’s energy related product lines 
include the manufacture of complex components 
used in measurement-while-drilling (“MWD”) 
and logging-while-drilling (“LWD”) tools. Each 
customer has specific MWD/LWD requirements 
and each order is highly complex and can 
take many hours to complete. Dearborn fits 
well with the product lines manufactured 
by Hunting Innova, as Innova’s electronic 
measurement tools are often housed in 
Dearborn’s products.

“  Part of the 
immediate 
integration 
strategy of 
Titan is to 
commence the 
manufacturing of 
its products at 
other Hunting 
facilities.”
W L Doffing (“Doffing”) – In early September 
201 1, Hunting completed the acquisition of the 
business and assets of Doffing, a precision 
machining services business, for a consideration 
of £14.2m. Doffing complements Dearborn, 
in that it supplies critical tolerance machining, 
prototyping and first-pass specialist production 
services used in MWD/LWD applications.
Titan – In mid-September 201 1, the Group 
also completed the acquisition of Titan, the 
largest acquisition in the Group’s history, for a 
consideration of £508.6m. Titan is a leading 
provider of perforating gun systems, shaped 
charges, well logging instrumentation and 
perforating gun switches used in drilling 
complex horizontal wells, predominantly for shale 
related drilling. Titan is a supplier of proprietary 
perforating products in North America and further 
exposes Hunting to the high growth global shale 
drilling market, to which the Group already 
supplies many other components. Part of the 
immediate integration strategy of Titan is to 
commence the manufacturing of its products at 
other Hunting facilities including the Wuxi facility 
in China where large growth opportunities have 
been identified. Further cross-selling opportunities

Specialty Supply (“Specialty”) – In October 
201 1, Hunting completed the acquisition 
of Specialty Supply, a supplier of precision 
machined components, for a consideration of 
£24.5m. Speciality’s products are used in the 
global directional drilling markets and include 
drill pipe screens, running gear, steering tools 
and gyro systems.
Since the completion of these acquisitions, 
all businesses have performed in line with 
management expectations, with business 
momentum being maintained from the final 
quarter of 201 1 into the new trading year. 
Manufacturing and sales synergies have already 
been identified and are being implemented, 
with further systems integration planned for 
the near future.
From the start of 2012, Hunting has commenced 
a unified marketing initiative for the Innova, 
Dearborn and Doffing product lines. Under 
the new branding of ‘Hunting Advanced 
Manufacturing Group’ , the Group now offers 
a single source solution for MWD/LWD 
measurement tools. Using the technical expertise 
of these three businesses, Hunting is aiming to 
become a leading supplier of MWD/LWD tools, 
removing the need for multiple component-
sourcing currently required by our customers.
Following the four acquisitions, Hunting now has 
38 manufacturing facilities worldwide (2010 – 30) 
with a global footprint totalling over 2.5m square 
feet of capacity. 
During the year, Hunting continued its internal 
investment programme across its global facilities. 
In 201 1, the Group increased capital expenditure 
to £58.0m (2010 – £49.0m), of which £57 .8m 
(2010 – £48.7m) was invested within the Group’s 
primary operating unit, Hunting Energy Services. 
Within the Group figure of £58.0m, new business 
development comprised of £45.2m (2010 – 
£36.8m) and replacement expenditure was 
£12.8m (2010 – £12.2m). During 201 1 the Group 
completed a project in Scotland to consolidate 
manufacturing to two principal sites at Badentoy 
and Fordoun, relocated and consolidated its

manufacturing capabilities in Dubai and formally 
opened its Wuxi facility in China. In 2012 new 
capital projects at Houma, Louisiana and Stafford, 
Texas are due to be completed, which will further 
increase the total operating footprint.
The Group also continued to build its Exploration 
and Production business where £2.3m was 
invested during the year (2010 – £7 .1m).
Health, Safety and Environment
During 201 1, Hunting Energy Services recorded 
3.36m personnel hours compared to 2.30m in 
2010, an increase of 46%. We are pleased to 
report that even with this increase, the number 
of recordable incidents decreased by 26% to 26 
incidents compared to 35 in 2010. The incident 
per million person hours worked therefore 
decreased 49% to 7 .7 compared to 15.2 in 2010.
Outlook
Hunting has commenced 2012 on a solid 
footing, as the demand for energy remains firm. 
The Group now has an established global 
manufacturing presence in key energy regions 
around the world, with a broad product and 
service offering for our customers. With our new 
acquisitions, we have extended the number of 
touch points in the oil and gas well bore and 
have many opportunities to cross-sell our 
products into the new and existing market 
segments in which we serve, while maximising 
the Group’s manufacturing efficiency with our 
enlarged operating footprint.
In North America, shale related drilling 
will continue to support product demand as 
customers continue to focus on oil related resource 
plays. As activity in the Gulf of Mexico continues 
to increase, Hunting anticipates increased business 
in this area, which will increase the demand for 
our products, particularly those applicable to 
deepwater drilling activity. In Europe, despite 
the reduced number of active rigs following 
the UK government’s new tax legislation, new 
development projects continue to be sanctioned 
in the North Sea, which will maintain activity 
throughout the year. In South East Asia, the 
continued increase in demand for energy will 
support our manufacturing activities in Singapore 
and China.
Oil and gas demand is forecast to continue to 
grow as we continue through the year, subject 
to the economic and geopolitical climate not 
declining further. In the medium to long term, 
industry commentators are forecasting a 70% 
increase in investment in capital spending over 
the next decade to meet anticipated hydrocarbon 
demand, which provides confidence that 
Hunting’s products will be required in the future.
Business Strategy
The key elements of the Group’s business strategy 
to deliver long term shareholder value remain:
•	 To deliver both acquisitive and organic growth 
across all of the Group’s core operations.
•	 To invest and develop the business platforms 
to augment:
 – Proprietary products and services;
 – Increased market share strength;
 – Enlarged global footprint; and
 – Capture of synergies from the opportunities 
thus created.
Underpinning these strategic objectives is a 
commitment to manufacture and deliver high 
quality products and services with a reputation 
for reliability and on time delivery under the 
Hunting brand.
Business Model
The key features of the Group’s business model 
which seeks to deliver its strategic objectives are:
•	 A decentralised management structure allowing 
local management to identify and react to 
customer or local market requirements.
•	 Close monitoring, support and direction from 
the centre.
•	 Short chains of command allowing for faster 
decision making.
•	 Framework of controls with discretionary 
limits and powers for local management.
•	 Flexible cost structures which can adapt to 
market conditions.
•	 Common standards for quality, health and 
safety across operations.
Maintaining high operational standards across 
all of the Group’s activities is viewed as one 
of the building blocks in delivering a strong 
financial performance.
Investment in proprietary products 
and expanded facilities, here in 
Scotland, have continued.

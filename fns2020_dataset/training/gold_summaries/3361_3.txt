I am delighted to report very positive
results for the financial year ended
31 July 2004. Throughout the year
Charteris continued to make good
progress in recovering from the market
downturn and its effects on trading.
The results for the year have exceeded
market expectations, as indicated in
our trading update on 29 July 2004.
Results
T urnover in the year ended 31 July
2004 was £13.8m (2002/03: £12.2m).
The year-on-year growth of 13% was
in itself very pleasing, but the progress
can probably best be seen by looking at
the sequence of half-yearly revenues:
2002/03 H2 – £4.5m, 2003/04 H1 –
£5.9m and H2 – £7.9m.
There was a strong improvement
in profitability with profit before tax
at £541k (2002/03: a loss of £625k).
Profit before tax and the amortisation
of goodwill was £717k and on this
basis profit margins were: 5% for
the year as a whole, 2% in H1 and
7% in H2.
There was good cash generation from
operating activities. The total cash
balance at 31 July 2004 was £4.2m
(31 July 2003: £3.3m).
The Directors are recommending 
the payment of a dividend of 0.4p 
(the same as in the previous year). 
If approved, the dividend will be paid 
on 30 November 2004 to shareholders
on the register on 15 October 2004.
Strategy
The investment in business
development to broaden the base of
the business is paying off. The retail,
manufacturing and services practice
accounted for 39% of turnover
(2002/03: 29%) and the government
and legal practice for 30% (2002/03:
22%). The sectors addressed by the
financial services and media practice
remain very important to Charteris,

Charteris Annual Report 2004 position in segments where there are
opportunities for growth, the Directors
believe that the company is well placed
to continue making good progress in
the current financial year.

but they continue to be on recovery
tracks and therefore accounted for a
smaller proportion of turnover, 31%
(2002/03: 49%); Charteris is less
dependent on these sectors than at
the time of the market downturn.
In accordance with the three-year
strategic plan developed in 2003, our
aim is now to continue growing the
business across the broader base,
focusing on those segments of the
market that display strong growth
potential. Through the practices we
can offer clients specialised services
that are based on a deep
understanding of the demands of
their particular situations, whilst also
drawing on more general experience
of business consulting, project
management and technology from
across the whole Charteris team.
Another important part of our strategy
is for Charteris to grow by acquisition
as well as organically. Our first
acquisition in 2001, The Mandelbrot
Set (International) Limited, has been
very successful. With our good trading
progress and growing cash resources,
the pursuit of other suitable
acquisition opportunities is moving
higher up our agenda.
Prospects 
The Directors consider that the very
positive results demonstrate that
Charteris is well on course at the 
end of the first year of its three-year
strategic plan. In this second year 
we are continuing to emphasise
investment in business development,
e.g. by additional key recruitment, 
and this is likely to temper short-term
improvements in profit margins.
Although the markets in which
Charteris operates generally seem
much more stable than they were 
a year ago, overall conditions remain
challenging. Nevertheless, in view
of the strengthening of Charteris’

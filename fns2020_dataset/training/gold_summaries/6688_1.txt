DIRECTORS’ REPORT:BUSINESS REVIEW
investment was slightly ahead of depreciation, as expected, partly
driven by franchise commitments in both Southern and London
Midland but also to maintain our high quality asset base in our
expanding bus division.
We made good progress with bus acquisitions in the year, with a
total investment of £37.2m, of which cash consideration was
£35.2m. On 3 October 2009 we purchased EastThames Buses
fromTransport for London for £5.0m, and bought Arriva’s
Horsham depot for £5.0m.These businesses are now fully
integrated into Go-Ahead London and Metrobus respectively.
On 1 December 2009 we completed the acquisition of Plymouth
Citybus for £19.0m, a high quality urban operation with a large
centrally located freehold depot and a strong reputation that we
are seeking to further enhance. In March 2010 we acquired the
entire share capital of Konectbus, a quality operator in East Anglia,
and completed the acquisition of Arriva’s Hexham depot
operations and sold our Ashington depot to Arriva.
We remain financially robust and gained investment grade ratings
from Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s in the period and completed
our debut issue of a 7½ year £200m bond in March 2010.This
further strengthens our balance sheet and secures our financing
beyond our November 2012 bank facilities.We have maintained our
full year dividend to shareholders at 81.0p per share (2009: 81.0p).
DIVISIONAL PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW
Bus
Our bus division performed slightly ahead of our expectations due
to a strong finish to the year. Like-for-like revenue increased in all
six of our bus companies, endorsing the economic resilience of
these operations. Our acquisitions performed well and contributed
£3.6m of operating profit, including a strong performance by East
Thames Bus. Operating profit* was slightly below last year at
£63.7m (2009: £66.6m), primarily due to lower margin contract
renewals in our regulated London operations. Our devolved
structure encourages high levels of service quality, customer focus
and strong local cost control. Management initiatives contributed a
further £4.3m of cost savings. We continue to champion Group
purchasing power and have de-risked fuel costs through a
comprehensive hedging programme that is complete for the next
two years at 41pence per litre (ppl), compared with 47 ppl in the
year just ended. Capital investment continues at above depreciation,
ensuring that we retain one of the youngest bus fleets in the sector
and maintain our strategically important freehold depot locations.
I am pleased with our overall operational performance.
We continue to deliver solid results by prioritising service quality,
operational excellence, local focus on our high density urban
businesses and financial discipline.
Summary of performance
Revenue was £2,201.6m (2009: £2,187.2m), with the increase of
£14.4m consisting of a reduction of £194.3m due to a change in
access charge regime subsidy and an underlying increase of
£208.7m, or 9.5%.
Overall operating performance was some £5m ahead of our
expectations, with operating profit* of £102.0m supported by a
strong finish to the year from our bus operations and lower than
anticipated electricity costs in our rail division.We completed the
disposal of the majority of our cargo and ground handling
operations during the year and expect to sell the remaining ground
handling operations in the next twelve months.
Strong cash management resulted in cashflow from operations
being well ahead of our expectations at £160.6m (2009: £233.4m)
and net debt remained low at £88.3m (2009: £91.0m). Capital
We continue to deliver solid results by prioritising service quality, operational excellence, local focus on
our high density urban businesses and financial discipline.
GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Keith Ludeman, Group Chief Executive 7 The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Financial Statements Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance Directors’ Report: Business Review
Market environment
In the near term, we expect economic conditions to remain
challenging. Political support from the new Government is strong,
notwithstanding the likelihood of reduced funding as part of the
Comprehensive Spending Review due to be announced in October
2010.We welcome the Government’s review of the future of rail
franchising and will actively participate in the consultation process.
In the medium term, we expect to benefit from both a cyclical
economic recovery and from the fundamental strengths of public
transport in the UK.
Our strategy
Our strategy continues to focus on providing high quality passenger
transport in the UK, primarily through bus and rail.
The underlying elements of this strategy are to:
• Run our companies in a safe, socially and environmentally
responsible manner
• Provide high quality, locally focused passenger transport services
• Prioritise high density, urban markets in the UK
• Maintain strong financial discipline to deliver shareholder value
In summary
We are pleased with the results for the year given the challenging
economic conditions and we have made good progress in
delivering our strategy.
Whilst we remain cautious on the near term outlook for the UK
economy and the potential impact of the Government’s October
2010 Comprehensive Spending Review on our operations, we
continue to be confident in the underlying strengths of, and growth
opportunities for, our business.

1 September 2010
Through our joint venture with Cook Illinois, Go-Ahead North
America finished its preparations to run its first yellow school bus
franchise in St Louis which commenced trading in August 2010.
Rail
Our rail division performed well and operating profit* was
approximately £3m ahead of our expectations, primarily due to a
reduction in electricity costs allocated by Network Rail at the end
of the financial year.
Each of our three rail franchises is underpinned by a focus on high
density, urban commuter markets. Passenger revenue continued to
grow in line with current expectations, with second half trends slightly
stronger than those in the first half. Operating profit* was £37.3m
compared to £61.5m last year, primarily due to the change from the
previous to the new Southern franchise, more difficult economic
conditions compared to the assumptions at the time of our bid for
Southeastern and additional costs in London Midland.We began
running the new Southern franchise in September 2009 and are
pleased with the performance of this franchise to date.This year saw
the introduction of the UK’s first domestic high speed rail service,
operated by Southeastern between St Pancras International and Kent
as part of a major timetable change in December 2009. In London
Midland the new management team has significantly improved the
operational performance of that franchise.We continue to make
good progress with cost control initiatives in our rail operations and
estimate savings for the year just ended of £25.0m.
Aviation services
We disposed of the majority of our cargo and ground handling
operations in January 2010 and are making progress on disposing
of the remaining ground handling operations. Consequently, operating
profit* of £1.0m (2009: £0.7m) for the aviation services division for
the financial year consisted primarily of our Meteor parking and
security business which performed as expected in the year.

Sterling Energy PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2007
c hairman’s Statement
Sterling made significant advances in 
2007. However, it was a very challenging 
year for the Company, particularly in 
respect of the share price, bank 
financing and our underlying asset 
performance. We have announced 
recently that we have taken steps to 
address this situation through the sale of 
our USA assets. We intend to focus in 
future on potentially “Company making” 
opportunities.
In March 2007 the acquisition of Whittier 
Energy in the USA for $147 million was 
completed, and in November we 
announced the signature of the Sangaw 
North PSC in Kurdistan. Our annual 
production averaged 5,760 barrels of oil 
equivalent per day, an improvement of 
31% over 2006. Progress was also made 
with our exploration assets in Africa and 
the Middle East. However, the 
development of our licence portfolio has 
been slower than we had hoped owing 
to continuing intense competition for 
international oil and gas opportunities 
and our focus on only very high potential 
opportunities which are sensibly priced. 
EBITDA was $56.6 million and there  
was a loss before tax of $2.9 million after 
pre-licence exploration expenditure of 
$4.5 million. Production decline at the 
Chinguetti oilfield in Mauritania now 
appears to have stabilised with recent 
gross production of about 10,000 gross 
barrels per day. New development wells 
and other remedial action are underway 
to improve production levels markedly.
There was a significant increase in the 
Company’s oil and gas reserves as a 
result of the Whittier acquisition. Our 
total reserves have increased from the 
equivalent of 12.9 million barrels of oil 
entitlement in 2006 to 21.3 million barrels 
of oil equivalent at the end of 2007. 
We drilled 29 wells in the USA in 2007 of 
which 24 were successful. There has 
been a small reduction in our booked US 
reserves as a result of production not 
being fully replaced, with faster than 
expected declines in some wells, and 
through weather and equipment delays 
which delayed some production 
increases.
“We have recently announced the 
plan to dispose of our US assets, 
we intend in future to focus on 
potentially ‘Company making’ 
opportunities.”

Sterling’s 2007 production in the USA 
averaged 25.8 million cubic feet of gas 
equivalent per day. While this marked a 
significant improvement over 2006, it 
was slightly lower than we had hoped. It 
should also be borne in mind that some 
55% of our global production is gas, 
rather than oil. While it is good to be able 
to report a recent improvement in gas 
prices in the USA, the improvement is 
nowhere near as great as the increase in 
oil prices that we witnessed last year. 
Production in the USA in March 2008 
reached a record of over 30 mmcfgd.
In December we announced the 
successful renegotiation of our bank 
facilities. This was an important 
milestone at a time of severe credit 
constraint in the global credit market.  
We now have a borrowing facility of  
$158 million syndicated with a number  
of major banks, of which $153 million is 
currently drawn down. Recent cash 
balances and undrawn facilities were 
$16.4 million at the end of Q1 2008.
Recognising that market conditions are 
changing very fast, we have recently 
reviewed the Group’s prospects and 
opportunities. We have decided to put 
the USA assets up for sale to enable us 
to focus our resources on high reward 
ventures. After a sale, we expect to have 
no debt, significant cash and production 
income from Mauritania. It will be an 
enviable position from which to build. We 
have very recently added the high 
potential interest in Kurdistan and there 
are moves to fast track drilling in 
Madagascar.
On a personal note, I would like to thank 
our former Chairman Richard O’Toole 
who left after the AGM in June 2007 and 
Paul Griggs who left on 30 April 2008, 
and all our staff, Directors and advisers 
for their work and support in what has 
been an interesting and challenging year. 
I also wish Harry Wilson, Graeme 
Thomson and Jon Cooper every 
success in their new roles of Deputy 
Chairman, CEO and CFO respectively. 
Looking forward, the much anticipated 
oil industry consolidation has been 
slower than predicted, but we expect to 
be able to play a part and benefit from it. 
We have an exciting programme of 
exploration activity ahead of us and a 
strengthened management structure 
and focus, which I believe will add 
materially to the value of the Company.

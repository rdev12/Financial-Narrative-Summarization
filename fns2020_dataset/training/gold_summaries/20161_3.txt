 Against a background of financial turmoil and
weakening stock markets, 3i achieved
substantial growth in net asset value, and
successfully continued its strategy of raising
external funds to accelerate growth in assets
under management.
The total return of £792 million for the year to
31 March 2008 represented an 18.6% return
on opening shareholders’ funds, close to the
five-year average of 20.4%. The Board is
recommending a final ordinary dividend of
10.9p, making a total ordinary dividend for the
year of 17.0p per share, up 5.6% on last year.
The contribution from our mid-market Buyouts
business was exceptionally strong. The Growth
Capital business performed well and will in future
include the results of later-stage technology
investing which shares the same characteristics
as growth investing in other sectors. Venture
Capital will continue to be reported as a separate
business line until all assets are disposed of,
although no new early-stage venture
investments will be made. Our new Quoted
Private Equity business has been a cautious
investor due to unsettled markets while
Infrastructure has continued to focus on
opportunities with long-term contractual cash
flows that make this asset class attractive to
investors in an uncertain environment.
Over the past three years, we have taken
advantage of strong demand to realise over 
£6 billion from our portfolio, at an average 
uplift over the opening value of these assets at
the beginning of each year of 43%. Over this
same three-year period we have returned just
over £2 billion to shareholders, improving our
capital efficiency, and raised funds totalling over
£5 billion including a commitment of £2.5 billion
from 3i. We closed the latest of these funds, 
an unquoted vehicle for investing in Indian
infrastructure, above target in March 2008 at
$1.2 billion.
With so much uncertainty still clouding economic
prospects in the major economies, we take a
cautious view of the coming year. Management
has for some time made it clear that realisations
were expected to slow, as time would be
needed to fulfil the growth plans of newly-
acquired assets and realise full value from 
these investments, and we will be taking a highly
selective approach to investment.
Our existing €550 million convertible bond
matures in August. It has provided a great deal
of flexibility in our capital planning, at attractive
rates of return. We have therefore decided 
to replace it with a new circa £425 million 
similar bond.
At times like these, 3i’s standards of
transparency and accountability, reinforced by
14 years’ experience as a quoted company,
serve the Company well. In our annual reports,
which have been widely praised by observers of
both private equity and quoted companies, we
strive to provide our shareholders with a detailed
picture of our approach to investment, valuation
and risk management. This also stood us in good
stead at a time of unprecedented interest in the
industry and some challenge to its reputation. 
This led the British Private Equity and Venture
Capital Association to invite Sir David Walker to
set up a working group on transparency and
accountability, of which I was delighted to be a
member. This annual report is fully in compliance
with Sir David’s guidelines, as explained on page
122. Moreover, we have taken again the
opportunity to increase disclosure beyond that,
by providing more detailed information on our
valuation methodology (see page 106).
In the following pages, Philip Y ea and his
management team provide updates on the
business lines, geographies and sectors in which
3i operates, with Asia showing the most
significant growth. At Board level, there will be
only one change at our AGM: as I intimated last
year, Fred Steingraber, who has been a non-
executive Director since the beginning of 2002,
will be retiring. Fred’s international experience
has been especially helpful to the Board over the
last six years and I would like to thank him for his
important contribution.
We start the year at a moment of great
uncertainty as to the impact of the credit
crunch, energy prices and raw material costs on
economic activity, and as to whether these
pressures can be managed by the world’s
monetary authorities without precipitating
recession or a sharp rise in inflation. We believe
that our mid-market focus, a portfolio well-
diversified by sector, geography and type of
investment, and the quality of our Board and
management team, provide a combination that
positions us well to meet these challenges and
build further value for shareholders.

_1_cover.indd   1 26/10/2007   10:36:40 WHAT WE DO
Hot Tuna own the global rights to the Hot Tuna brand, a progenitor of global youth fashion, 
born in Australia with a heritage of authentic surf culture.
The Group has coordinated design, marketing and distribution competence in its core 
markets supported by a team of inspired, experienced and young designers, marketers, 
salespeople and management with apparel expertise.
DESIGN
From its very beginning in the late sixties Hot Tuna 
was always the rebellious brand that dared to be 
different, without taking itself too seriously. While 
maintaining that core spirit and bringing the brand 
to the forefront of surf-fashion today, we have put 
together a second-to-none team of experienced 
designers from Sydney, London and Los Angeles, 
who will all operate from Hot Tuna’s new creative 
platform in our corporate showroom, in downtown 
Los Angeles. They will be working alongside our 
marketing and merchandising staff to ensure global 
brand consistency and make extensive use of our 
sourcing facility in Shanghai to ensure a cost and 
time-effective design process and ultimately better 
delivery rates and profit margins.
MARKETING AND PROMOTION
The Hot Tuna brand is built on a platform of 
quality surf lifestyle products that represents real 
value in terms of experience and creative expression. 
Being blessed with promoting a brand that never 
“sold out” and still remains respected and admired 
in the surf community is not only a great asset for 
our designers, but also makes the job of our 
marketing staff much easier, as they don’t have 
to “invent” credibility by jazzing up the message.
The Hot Tuna marketing and promotional activity 
is mainly at grassroots level. We sponsor athletes 
within the surf community who represent our core 
values, surfers who are “real” and aspirational.
The most invaluable marketing for us is to see 
our surfers and the surf community endorsing our 
product on the beach.
The Hot Tuna marketing and design staff work 
in partnership with our customers making sure that 
the brand visualisation at retail is consistent and 
effective in promoting the brand and maximising sales.
SPONSORSHIP AND EVENTS
Hot Tuna sponsors major surfing events and 
competitions around the world and features 
predominantly at major industry fashion shows, 
event parties and tradeshows.
Hot Tuna also proudly takes some of the core 
values that exist on the water into its association 
with charities and non-profit organisations that are 
trying to make the life on land a bit better for the 
ones who need it the most.

WHERE WE DO IT
Hot Tuna maintains its financial and executive headquarters in the United Kingdom; a design, 
production and marketing control centre in the USA; and a cultural hub in Australia.
UNITED KINGDOM
The Company’s administrative and economic base 
is in London, close to the financial market the 
Company serves, and proximal to Hot Tuna’s Board 
of Directors and advisors. Local sales teams 
service the established surfing centres and 
fashion communities of Great Britain and the 
greater European surf-lifestyle market, and 
contribute globally to the aesthetic of the brand.
UNITED STATES

the home base of the Chief Executive Officer, it is 
the source of new inspiration and direction for the 
brand and the Company.
AUSTRALIA
The ‘Land Down Under’ continues as a source of 
inspiration for Hot Tuna. The Company’s operations 
in Australia ensure the values of the brand are 
evidenced worldwide, and that key market points

are effectively serviced.

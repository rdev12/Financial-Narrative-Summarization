 STRATEGIC REPORT
NWF GROUP plc
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 06
CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S REVIEW
The Directors present their Strategic 
report together with the audited financial 
statements of the Parent Company (‘the 
Company’) and the Group for the year 
ended 31 May 2014.
This Strategic report has been prepared 
solely to provide additional information 
to shareholders to assess the Company’s 
strategies and the potential for those 
strategies to be successful.
The Strategic report contains certain 
forward-looking statements. These 
statements are made by the Directors 
in good faith based on the information 
available to them up to the time of 
their approval of this report and such 
statements should be treated with 
caution due to the inherent uncertainties, 
including both economic and business 
risk factors, underlying any such 
forward-looking information.
The Directors, in preparing this Strategic 
report, have complied with Section 414C 
of the Companies Act 2006.
This Strategic report has been prepared 
for the Group as a whole and therefore 
gives greater emphasis to those matters 
which are significant to NWF Group plc 
and its subsidiary undertakings when 
viewed as a whole.
Business and Financial Review
This good set of results for the Group has 
been achieved by clear, targeted actions 
by management in all three divisions, 
which have been delivered in line with our 
plans. Operating cash conversion remains 
above 100% demonstrating continued 
effective cash management and new 
five year facilities have been agreed with 
Royal Bank of Scotland to support the 
long-term development of the Group.
The Group delivered an operating profit 
of £8.5 million (2013: £9.4 million) and a 
headline profit before tax of £7.7 million 
(2013: £8.5 million). This was achieved 
against a less favourable market 
backdrop than was experienced 
in the record year of 2013.
Net debt of £11.7 million (2013: £9.2 million), 
which represents a debt to EBITDA ratio 
of 1.0 times (2013: 0.7 times), was delivered 
in spite of the £6.5 million cash acquisition 
costs in the year, highlighting the 
cash-generative capability of the Group.
Banking
The Group has an agreement in place 
with The Royal Bank of Scotland Group 
for credit facilities totalling £65.0 million 
through to 31 October 2019, comprising 
£10.0 million of revolving credit facilities, 
£50.0 million of working capital facilities 
and ancillary facilities of £5.0 million 
for guarantees and overdrafts. These 
facilities and the ongoing support of 
the bank allow the Group to progress 
its development plans. There is significant 
headroom against these facilities after 
allowing for anticipated working capital 
fluctuations during the year.

Future developments and strategy
NWF Group is a specialist agricultural 
and distribution business delivering feed, 
food and fuel across the UK. Each of our 
trading divisions have scale and good 
market positions, and are both profitable 
and cash generative. 
In our Feeds division, we are a leading 
national supplier of ruminant animal feeds 
(feeding one in six dairy cows in Britain) 
and are continuing to develop the business 
with investment in sales and marketing. 
Since the year end we have opened a new 
blending facility in Dumfries to support the 
growing Scottish market and to service 
our existing customers in that region. 
We are continuing to focus on technical 
leadership and to be the nutritional 
adviser of choice. We are looking to 
continue our track record of organic 
growth in this division and, in line with 
our strategic emphasis on Agriculture, 
we are looking for complementary and 
bolt-on acquisition opportunities to 
increase our business with UK farming.
In Food, we have improved our performance 
through the consolidation of all customers 
at the key Wardle site. We remain focused 
on continuing to provide excellent levels 
of customer service and support whilst 
ensuring we drive efficiencies in the 
business, which can further improve returns.
In Fuels, we have a proven depot operating 
model and have demonstrated that the 
rationalised business has recovered 
to sustainable levels of performance. 
We are looking to develop the business 
organically through the establishment 
of new storage depots and through 
appropriate strategic bolt-on acquisitions.
The Group has established a solid platform 
for development, has competitive long-term 
banking facilities and a strong asset base.
Key performance indicators
The Directors use the following combination 
of financial and non-financial KPIs as 
a method of determining how well the 
Group is performing against its objectives 
and overall strategy:
Feeds
 » 4,300 customers 
(2013: 4,000 customers)
 » Sold 543,000 tonnes in the year ended 
31 May 2014 (2013: 481,000 tonnes)
 » Revenue of £160.7 million in 
the year ended 31 May 2014 
(2013: £153.1 million)
 » Operating profit of £3.3 million 
in the year ended 31 May 2014 
(2013: £3.8 million)
Feeds has been successful in securing 
additional business direct to farmers in 
the year and has grown its market share.
Food
 » Average of 97,000 pallets stored 
(2013: 93,000 pallets)
 » 800,000 square feet of warehousing 
(2013: 900,000 square feet)
 » Over 200 customers 
(2013: over 200 customers)

(2013: £1.2 million)
Food has successfully completed 
the planned restructuring with all 
customers now located at the main 
Wardle facility, which has significantly 
improved operating efficiency. 
Fuels
 » Sales volumes in 2014 – 402 million 
litres (2013: 411 million litres)
 » Supply 57,000 customers
 » 17 fuel depots across the UK (2013: 17)

(2013: £356.3 million)
 » Operating profit of £3.2 million

(2013: £4.4 million)
Fuels has delivered a robust financial 
performance against a market environment 
which has been impacted by a notably 
warmer winter trading period which 
substantially reduced the demand 
for heating oil products.
Corporate and social responsibility
The Board of Directors monitors and 
evaluates its obligations in respect of 
its corporate and social responsibilities 
and in particular aims to support all 
Group employees.

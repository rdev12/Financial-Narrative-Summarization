 Chairman’ s statement
Financial results
Turnover for the year to 30 September
2002 was significantly higher at
£126.0 million (2001: £76.6 million),
due to the substantial expansion in
numbers of homes transferred into
Highfield Care. Profit before taxation
was £16.4 million (2001: £10.0 million)
after a provision for bad debts of £4.8
million (2001: £10.3 million) and an
exceptional credit of £0.2 million (2001:
exceptional costs of £4.7 million).
Earnings per Ordinary Share were up
by 25 per cent to 10.1p (2001: 8.1p,
restated for the effects of the Rights
Issue during the year). There was a
tax credit of £0.5 million (2001: credit
of £2.4 million). 
The net exceptional credit of £0.2 million
comprises primarily tenant receivership
costs of £1.5 million (2001: £0.5 million)
and a credit of £1.5 million (2001: charge
of £1.7 million) representing a write
back of prior charges for permanent
diminution of asset values. 
The creation of our Highfield Care
business to operate many of the care
homes owned by NHP has meant that
Both businesses made steady
progress this year. We have added
109 NHP homes to the operating
business and the property business
has seen a significant improvement in
the rent collection from, and covenant
strength of, its tenant base (including
Highfield Care). This improvement has
been reflected in greatly increased
asset values. 
The successful transformation of NHP
was effected as planned despite the
operating environment for the publicly
funded care home industry generally
continuing to be difficult in the UK. There
have been significant fee increases paid
by local authorities in some parts of the
UK, generally triggered by a localised
supply and demand imbalance.
However , margin pressures caused by
the rising costs of care provision have
resulted in continuing home closures.
The vast majority of local authorities
across the UK will not link their fees to
the rising cost of long term care for the
elderly . These factors, combined with
long NHS hospital waiting lists, have
pushed care for the elderly up the
political agenda. 
our properties now fall into two asset
classes: investment properties (leased
to third parties) and operated properties
(homes leased to Highfield Care). The
investment properties are re-valued
annually at 30 September by external,
independent valuers. From 30
September 2002 onwards, the
operated properties will also be re-
valued annually at that date by the same
external valuers. T aking the two asset
classes together , the value of our
properties at year-end was £643.3
million, representing a 9.5 per cent
increase over last year’ s £587.7 million. 
The uplift in the revaluation reserve of
£56.6 million together with the retained
profit for the year of £16.9 million and
the receipt of £31.9 million (net) in
proceeds from the Rights Issue
produced a 103 per cent increase in
shareholders’ funds to £207.7 million
(2001: £102.4 million). Net asset value
per NHP Ordinary Share rose by 58 per
cent to a year-end figure of 103.4p
(2001: 65.5p, restated for the effects of
the Rights Issue) and net recourse
borrowings were reduced to £51.5
million (2001: £93.8 million).
2 NHP Plc 
The year under review saw the transformation of NHP
into two distinct business units: the original property
business and the new operating business, Highfield
Care. Highfield Care provides NHP with a vehicle to
manage its owned homes as well as a potential source
of quality profits in the future. NHP Plc  3
Dividend
At the time of the Rights Issue,
announced in May , we said that
although the Board did not intend to
recommend a dividend in respect of the
year just ended, it was our intention to
return to the dividend list as soon as
possible thereafter . At that time, we
intended to apply to the Courts for a
reconstruction of capital to eliminate
negative distributable reserves which
existed as at 30 September 2001.
This would have allowed us to resume
dividend payments.
In the event, retained profit and the
effect of the increase in the valuation
of our properties have created
positive distributable reserves in the
holding Company . If trading remains
at current levels, the Directors would
expect to declare an interim dividend
in June 2003 of 0.5p per Ordinary
Share. In future we intend to pay
dividends to shareholders based
on the level of surplus funds
available after satisfying the capital
expenditure requirements of our
care home portfolio. 
Board and management
Our longest serving non-executive
Director , Arthur Bergbaum, retired
from the Board at the Annual General
Meeting in February . We thank him
for his contribution over the years
and wish him a long and happy
retirement.
In November , John Murphy became
Chief Executive of Highfield Care with
a brief to drive operational efficiency
forward and to deliver the highest
possible standards of care. John’ s
achievements to date in the care
home industry make him well qualified
to fulfil our ambitious strategic aims
for Highfield Care.
Outlook
We are successfully rebuilding value for
NHP shareholders and we are grateful
for their support of the successful
Rights Issue to raise £31.9 million (net)
during the year under review. A large
part of the strategy to achieve the goal
of rebuilding value was the creation of
our own operating capability . The Board
is encouraged with the progress made
to date by the Highfield Care team and,
with the appointment of John Murphy ,
believes we have begun to create a
potentially valuable asset for NHP
shareholders.
Our property-based activity has also
improved this year and, looking
forward, we believe that the level of
tenant receiverships will significantly
reduce. The property business will
also continue to benefit from the smaller
number of financially stronger tenants
now in place who can afford the
substantial investment necessary
to keep our homes in top condition.
At 30 September 2002, four tenants
(including Highfield Care) operated
86 per cent of the total number of
beds owned by NHP .
With both operating and property
businesses continuing to perform to
plan, I expect another year of progress
for NHP despite the difficult economic
environment within the publicly funded
care home industry .

Inspicio plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006
chairman’s statement
Keith Tozzi
 “ The turnaround 
of Inspectorate 
has continued on 
track, with trading 
particularly strong 
throughout 2006.”
I am delighted to report Inspicio’s financial results for its first full year of 
operations. It has been a very busy period in which the turnaround of 
Inspectorate has continued on track and the Group made significant 
strategic acquisitions of the Environmental Services Group (“ESG”) in May 
and the Eclipse Scientific Group (“Eclipse”) in August which have added to 
the depth and strength of Inspicio’s global offering. We are very pleased 
with both these acquisitions. Their results have been strong and their 
integration into the Group has progressed well.
Turnover for the Group for the 12 months to 31 December 2006 was 
£161.9m (2005: £26.2m) and earnings, including income from joint 
ventures, before exceptional items, amortisation, interest and tax were 
£7.6m, compared to a loss of £0.5m in the 38 weeks to 31 December 2005. 
Group profit before interest and tax was £3.2m (2005: loss of £4.3m).
In Inspectorate, trading has been particularly strong throughout 2006. 
Inspectorate’s principal operational focus is in the commodity testing and 
inspection sector and the Company enjoys a strong brand and reputation 
for excellent client service. As a result, Inspectorate’s revenue growth for 
the 12 months to 31 December 2006 was 16.9 per cent at constant exchange 
rates. Operating profit before exceptional items was £5.2m at a margin 
of 4.1 per cent. This compares to a loss of £0.6m in the 12 months to 
31 December 2005 on a pro forma basis. Inspectorate is on track to 
achieve 8 per cent operating margins in the second half of 2007.
On 2 May 2006 Inspicio acquired ESG for £16.0m. ESG includes several 
businesses in the soil, environmental and building testing sector providing 
laboratory-based testing and consulting services. On 11 August 2006, the 
Group acquired Eclipse, the leading UK food testing business, for £47.0m. 
Both groups have traded well since their acquisition. 
“ The Group made 
significant strategic 
acquisitions of ESG 
in May and Eclipse 
in August.”

“ The market continues 
to be driven by 
increased regulation, 
high barriers to 
entry and growing 
world trade.”
“ With our global 
infrastructure, Inspicio 
is very well positioned 
to expand all areas 
of its businesses.”
In addition to ESG and Eclipse, the Group also completed several small  
in-fill acquisitions, the total consideration for which was £4.9m (including 
expected deferred payments), which added £1.1m of turnover in 2006.
The Group’s strategy includes the buying out of minority interests and 
agents in the Inspectorate network, thus strengthening our control over 
the use of the Group’s brand as well as over the testing and inspection 
processes and standards. During 2006 a majority stake was acquired in 
our Libyan agent and the minority interest in Hungary was acquired 
outright. Inspectorate also acquired an agent in Portugal and expanded 
its Metals & Minerals capabilities in Australia through the acquisition of 
Renton Laboratory Pty Ltd (“Standard & Reference Laboratories”).
Two small in-fill acquisitions were also completed in Eclipse following 
its acquisition by Inspicio, which strengthened its service offerings and 
geographic food testing capabilities. 
The market continues to be driven by increased regulation, high barriers 
to entry and growing world trade. With our global infrastructure, Inspicio 
is very well positioned to expand all areas of its businesses and to capitalise 
on the strength of underlying demand for its services. We are delighted 
with progress to date and are confident of future prospects.
I would like to congratulate the rest of the management team for the success 
that we have achieved this year and to offer my continued thanks to each 
staff member for their commitment and dedication over the past year.

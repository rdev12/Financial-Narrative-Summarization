 4George Wimpey Plc Annual Report 2003
With pre-exceptional proﬁt
before tax up 30%, 2003 was
another year of excellent
progress. Over three years,
pre-tax profits have grown
more than two and a half
times, whilst the operating
margin at George Wimpey 
has grown from 11.4% to
17.1% and at Morrison 
Homes from 8.6% to 11.9%.
Whilst we have been helped by
strong markets, the magnitude
of this improvement is the
result of strong and consistent
management action. In the 
UK, we have improved the 
way we buy land and the 
terms on which we buy it.
We have taken a lot of
overhead and construction
cost out of the business.
We have improved our product
and our customer service, and
thereby achieved increased
sales of customer speciﬁed 
upgrades.Whilst we have made
much progress in improving
our customer service, we know
we still have a long way to go
to meet the standards set by
the very best in retail industries.
We have established an
industry leading approach to
health and safety and our
environmental procedures have
been adopted as the standard
by the NHBC. We have made 
two acquisitions, McAlpine
Homes and Laing Homes,
on excellent terms and have
efﬁciently integrated both.
In Morrison Homes we have
refocused our strategy to
grow our volumes in our
established markets. Over
the past three years we have
grown by almost 40% which
together with improved land
purchase, procurement, and
growth in customer speciﬁed
upgrades has underpinned
our margin growth.
Delivering Success
The transformation in our
performance has been achieved
by delivering on the plan set
out in my ﬁrst Annual Report 
in 2000.That plan has also
established the potential for
ongoing success despite the
more challenging markets 
we may face.
Strong and consistent
management action has
transformed results 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
PETER JOHNSON
2000 – Steps to success
Complete restructuring of the UK business
Turn scale to advantage
Gain value from strengths of US business
Identify and develop new sources of proﬁt George Wimpey Plc Annual Report 2003 5
We have restructured the
business from 6 to 5 business
units and refocused the
business on a narrower
product and price range.
These changes will strengthen
the business, creating an
engine for ongoing growth.
At the same time we will
reduce our overall risk by
limiting the business’s
exposure to the higher 
price points over £750,000.
Morrison Homes
Morrison Homes offers us 
the potential for rapid profit
growth with the need for 
only limited cash investment.
George Wimpey UK
The UK business has been
comprehensively restructured.
Wimpey Homes and McLean
Homes were merged,
McAlpine Homes and Laing
Homes acquired and integrated
and a total of some £72 million
of overhead and build costs
saved. Our landbank and our
product and geographic mix
have been strengthened.We
are well placed to sustain
operating margins against a
background of more subdued
house price inﬂation.
Through systematic
benchmarking, co-ordination
of procurement and sharing 
of experiences, we have 
turned our scale into an
important competitive
advantage. Through better
planning and decision making,
land is being acquired on 
terms consistent with current
margins. It is our objective that
with modest, but steady,
growth in volumes, the core
UK business will continue to
contribute to proﬁt growth.
We have been applying 
the same principles within
Laing Homes. We will exceed
our original target of £10
million of cost savings.This,
together with the acquisition
of land on improved terms,
will support growth in the 
next two years.
The outlook for the US housing
market over the next decade is
excellent. Good affordability
arising from low interest rates
and employment growth are
widely expected to combine
with strong underlying
demographic trends – arising
from immigration and higher
birth rates than in Europe – 
to create a sustained strong
market.The regions in which
we operate also beneﬁt from
inward migration and hence
above average population 
and employment growth.
With a high asset turn, growth
requires lower investment than
would be the case in the more
capital intensive UK.
Morrison Homes has shown
continuous profit growth
since the appointment of 
Stu Cline as President in 1994.
Over the past two years,
we have refocused and
accelerated growth in our
existing markets, leading to
higher volumes and better
margins achieved through
improved land purchase,
procurement and overhead
recovery. At the same time,
underperforming businesses
have been reviewed and 
plans put in place to improve
performance, as in Atlanta 
and Dallas, or exit the market,
as in San Antonio. Over the
past three years, volumes 
have grown almost 40% 
and operating profits over 
2.2 times.
Morrison Homes provides
considerable potential for
further growth and the
landbank and organisation 
are in place to secure this.
Customer Focus
Our performance in the 
United States has been 
greatly aided by the sale 
of customer options.
These have increased
margins and improved 
our asset turn, and hence 
our ﬁnancial efﬁciency.
We have applied those 
lessons within the UK.

Our People
We have strong management
teams in place in both the 
UK and the US to deliver our
objectives. In particular, I 
am delighted we have been
able to fill the most senior
positions in the organisation
from within and expect to be
able to continue to do so.
The greatest credit for 
the transformation that has
taken place in the UK over 
the past three years must 
go to Keith Cushen. Keith
retired, as planned, at the 
end of 2003 when the
restructuring was complete
and his successor had 
been established.
On behalf of us all, I thank
Keith for not only his
achievements but also his
friendship and comradeship
over the past three years.
has grown from £34 million 
in 2000 to over £60 million 
in 2003. These options enable
our customers to personalise
their home and have the
products and fittings they
desire installed before they
move in. Two major new
centralised options centres 
on the lines of those that have
succeeded in Morrison Homes
have now been opened in
Edinburgh and Cannock.
Further centres are planned
for 2004.
Sustaining Proﬁt Growth 
in the Future
As we look towards a period
of more subdued house price
inflation, we believe we are
well placed to sustain future
proﬁt growth through targeting:
sustained margins and
volume growth in our core
George Wimpey business
lower costs, better margins
and longer term volume
growth in Laing Homes 
continued volume and proﬁt
growth in Morrison Homes.
continued growth of
customer options and
related income streams 
in both the UK and US
At the same time, lower land
price inﬂation would enable us
to improve cash generation.
I am delighted he has agreed 
to become a consultant 
to the Company during 
2004 to ensure a smooth
management transition.
Keith has been succeeded 
by Peter Redfern, who 
has been at Keith’s side
throughout these three 
years and who will ensure 
that the progress continues.
Peter has already established
himself as Managing Director
and is supported by a 
strong and experienced 
UK management team.
We have also embarked 
on the process of planning 
for the next generation in
Morrison Homes. Whilst Stu
Cline continues as President,
Steve Parker has been
appointed Executive Vice
President of Operations with 
full responsibility for the day
to day management of
Morrison’s operations. Steve
has built an outstanding
business in Florida and will 
in due course be a most able
successor to Stu.
Finally, a huge thank you goes
to all those who work in our
forty local housebuilding
companies in the UK and 
the US. It is through their
extraordinary dedication as
well as their local knowledge
and experience that the 
Group has transformed its
performance over the past
three years. It is also them 
who make my job so fulﬁlling.
PETER JOHNSON
Chief Executive’s Review (continued)
Our people – delivering success
The extraordinary dedication, as well as
local knowledge and experience of our
employees has transformed the
performance of our business over the 
past three years Building a strong business
for the future...
Over the past three years we have transformed the 
structure of our business, delivering on the promises 
we made and building strong foundations for future
earnings growth.
George Wimpey is well placed for the future 
through targeting:
sustained margins and volume growth in our core 
business, George Wimpey
lower costs, better margins and longer term volume

business, Morrison Homes
growth in the sale of customer options and related
income streams George Wimpey
Sustaining margins and growing volume  CONTROLLING COSTS
During 2003 George Wimpey experienced
minimal inﬂation in the cost of materials.
These costs are maintained at the lowest
possible levels by:
• 
detailed benchmarking of all products
across all businesses 
• 
maximising beneﬁts of scale through
national deals with major producers
Despite the well publicised shortages 
in skilled labour throughout the industry,
George Wimpey has kept labour costs 
under control by:
• 
thorough scheduling of activity,
providing a continuous flow of work 
for sub-contractors
• 
increasing the use of prefabricated
components reducing the requirements 
for skilled labour
• 
understanding the effects of PPG3
• 
sharing efﬁcient designs across all 
the businesses
• 
standardising product as far as possible to
reduce increased cost of ‘one-off’ designs
BUYING LAND ON BETTER TERMS
Over the past three years George Wimpey 
has totally changed the way land is bought.
Since the beginning of 2000 land purchase
margins have increased from under 8% 
to over 17%.
Land is now being bought earlier in 
the cycle to allow for increases in the 
time taken to acquire planning approval.
The transfer of land from the strategic 
landbank has continued to increase,
1,238 plots were transferred during 2003.

4. 3. 1. Using experience gained during the
restructuring of George Wimpey,
Laing Homes provides the Group with

proﬁt growth.
COSTS AND MARGINS
Total cost savings following acquisition are
now anticipated to be at least £12 million.
Overhead savings have come from the
head ofﬁce closure and absorption of
centralised functions into George Wimpey.
In addition, restructuring to reduce the
number of business units from 6 to 5 will
ensure the business can go forward from 
a position of strength.
By introducing George Wimpey working
practices and procedures, Laing Homes
margins will be brought in line with those
of George Wimpey.
Material costs will be reduced and
controlled by:
• 
being included in national purchasing
deals for the total UK business
• 
benchmarking and sharing ideas 
both within Laing Homes and with
George Wimpey
• 
greater standardisation of product
Costs on site are being improved by
reducing work in progress, improving
scheduling, making greater use of
prefabricated components and
standardising designs.
LAND
Land is now being purchased at better
margins and hurdle rates have been
increased to come in line with those 
at George Wimpey. Since acquisition,
the programme of land investment 
has strengthened the short term
landbank, creating a platform for 
future volume growth.
OPTIONS
Learning from lessons at Morrison Homes
and George Wimpey, Laing has the
potential to develop an additional revenue
stream through the sale of options.

1. STRATEGY FOR GROWTH
Morrison Homes is well positioned in 
the Southeast, Southwest and Western
regions of the US, in markets with 
strong demographics and good
employment prospects.
The business has a clear strategy 
for growth, aiming to be a leading
housebuilder in each of its markets.
Satellite businesses in Jacksonville, Florida
and Central Valley, Northern California 
have achieved sufﬁcient scale to become
separate divisions in 2004.The satellite in
Sarasota is on track to become a division
in 2005.
Consistent with our growth strategy,
we aim to increase market share by
broadening our range of middle-market
products where the Morrison brand can
add value. New slightly smaller and more
efﬁcient products, as well as higher density
town houses, are being introduced to our
existing range of successful house types.
LANDBANK
During 2003 Morrison’s landbank grew by
over 25% and the business is in a strong
position for growth into 2004 and beyond.
Because Morrison achieves a high asset
turn, growth can be ﬁnanced with limited
investment. Where possible, we purchase
land as ‘ﬁnished lots’ , when required.
It is taken ready for us to start construction
on the home immediately, as all the
groundwork and infrastructure work has
been completed by the developer.
CUSTOMER SERVICE EXCELLENCE
The Morrison Homes brand is recognised
for excellence in customer service.
We measure customer satisfaction as
‘Willingness to Refer’ and as a company
achieved 84.7%. We aim to achieve a 
very demanding 90% goal and already 
a third of our divisions have achieved 
this outstanding score. According to
JDPower & Associates Morrison Homes
customer satisfaction rating is in the top
quartile of all builders, exceeding the
national average by 5%.
COST SAVING INITIATIVES
The operating margin rose to 11.9% in 
2003 as all divisions continued to focus 
on opportunities to reduce costs. Taking
advantage of scale, new procurement 
deals have reduced the number of
suppliers used by Morrison and improved
purchasing terms for products such as ﬁre
places, HVAC equipment and bath brass.

3. Customer Focus
Offering more, growing and improving services 
SERVICE EXCELLENCE 
In all our businesses we focus on integrity,
quality and excellence to provide
consistent standards of customer service.
All our homes come with a two year
guarantee which is twice the industry
average in both the UK and the US.
By July 2004, every employee in the UK,
from accountants to site managers, will
have taken part in a new training course
and workshops which have been
developed to highlight the importance 
of customer service in every area of 
the business.
The new ‘Respond’ customer care
management system provides customer
care staff with detailed records of every
home, including any extras that were
purchased with it, so queries can be 
dealt with speedily and efﬁciently.
WEBSITES 
All businesses have introduced new
customer focused websites. Customers 
in the UK, as well as searching for a new
home, can now search for a mortgage 
and shop on line. In future they will also 
be able to choose their options.
In the US, 75% of Morrison Homes’
prospective customers used the internet
and www.morrisonhomes.com attracts
70% more visitors than a year ago. A
number of new sales tools are used to
communicate with prospective customers,
helping to identify and attract those most
likely to purchase a Morrison home.
New customer magazines, Nest and 
Wall to Wall, will help the UK business
communicate with customers, keeping
them up to date with new developments,
initiatives and offers.
FINANCE AND OTHER SERVICES
Morrison Homes has led the way in
introducing additional services to make
buying a Morrison Home easier, 66% of 
all customers arranged their mortgages
through Morrison Financial, and in 
Florida and Texas 90% of customers 
used Morrison Title.
A new joint venture business, UK Home
Finance Limited, will provide even greater
ﬂexibility when purchasing a home from
George Wimpey or Laing Homes. Financial
products available to new and existing
customers, now include unique mortgage,
remortgage and insurance products at
preferential rates.

Providing our customers with greater
opportunities to customise their new
homes has become an important part 
of our business. It enables customers to
create their own individual style in their
new homes and provides the business
with an additional source of proﬁt.
LEADING THE WA Y
In 2000 Morrison opened its ﬁrst prototype
centralised Signature Selection Centre in
Orlando. Since then new options centres
opened have been improved, increasing
the showroom space and the range of
products available.
Centralised centres are now available 
in all Morrison’s markets. By providing
customers with an extended range of
products, displayed in a retail environment
and with individual appointments the 
sale of options per customer has risen 
to $27,400, which represents 10% of the
business’s turnover.
TAKING THINGS FURTHER
Building on lessons learnt at Morrison
Homes, in June 2003 George Wimpey 
East Scotland opened the ﬁrst centralised
selection centre in the UK. Unique not 
only for George Wimpey but also for the
industry. More than 3,000 different items
are available for customers to choose from.
At the centre,average sales per customer
have almost doubled.
George Wimpey has opened a further
centralised centre in Cannock, in the
Midlands, in early 2004 with more centres
planned. Site based selection centres will
continue to develop. Over the past 3 years
sales per customer have risen from almost
£3,000 per customer to just over £5,000.
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE FUTURE
The sale of optional extras to 
customers at Laing Homes is still being
developed. Using experience from
elsewhere in the Group, Laing Homes 
has the potential to signiﬁcantly
increase options revenue to the levels
achieved in George Wimpey regions.

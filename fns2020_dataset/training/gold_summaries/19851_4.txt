 Our strategic priorities
We started our rebuild phase in the Spring of 2015 – focusing on strengthening TT, across six strategic priorities  
as a framework for action and direction. We have made an encouraging start and progress is evident in all areas.  
We continue to have a clear focus going forward:
Strategic priorities Progress 2016 priorities
1. Market leading position
Focus on opportunities where our competitive 
advantages lie to grow our market share, in 
particular in new geographies and various end 
markets to balance our presence. 
Developed a better understanding of our core strengths in engineered electronics. 
Focused on opportunities where we are best positioned, and can help  
our customers deliver the best end solutions to their customers; for example high 
performance resistors, heptic pedals, encoder chips.
Continue to focus on applications and end markets 
that have sustainable growth drivers, and where our 
expertise can be best applied – such as safety critical 
applications in aerospace or automotive, emmissions 
reduction, demanding temperature environments or 
precision-critical applications.
2. Enhanced customer focus
Put our customers first and strengthen our 
partnerships. Proactively manage relationships 
to build and defend our leading supplier position. 
Improve our presence in key growth geographies.
Improved our understanding of our customers and their requirements. through  
“voice of customer” programmes. Introduced a stronger focus on building 
engineering-led strategic partnerships, and increased our customers’ visibility of TT’s 
wider-capabilities. Strengthened our resources in key growth geographies to improve 
our response and support to our customers (for further information, see the Divisional 
review on pages 30 to 37).
Strengthen strategic account management.
Continue to strengthen capabilities and 
our coverage in high growth geographies.
Continue to build a more balanced 
customer portfolio.
 3.  Targeted and efficient  
R&D spend
Drive continued innovation to ensure our 
competitiveness. Improve efficiency in our project 
management and engineering processes to help 
release funding for more product development.
Revamped our R&D project management to improve transparency and efficiency, 
and eventually the returns on our R&D investment. Begun the journey of encouraging 
cross divisional R&D collaboration – forums and resources are put in place to create  
a stronger R&D community for best practice sharing and more innovative  
problem solving.
Complete the enforcement of the new R&D 
management framework.
Continue to build the TT R&D community  
to encourage and facilitate collaboration.
Launch more new products to market.
4. Operational efficiency
The benefits of achieving best in class operational 
performance are significant and key to our 
competitiveness. Improving global procurement 
practices and embedding Lean principles and tools 
are our key focuses.
Established the Operations Council and the Procurement Council to drive best practice 
globally and to leverage our global scale.
Developed our Lean model and trained the first class of 16 Master Lean Practitioners; 
completed our Lean assessment at the sites; see Strategy in Action on page 20. 
OIP projects are ahead of schedule and will be completed for less than the  
original budget.
Lean roll-out through the next wave of sites in 2016. 
More Master Lean Practitioner classes will be 
launched.
Review our procurement practices around the world. 
Roll-out new procurement practices globally including 
the implementation of strategic procurement 
practices and improve vendor assessment.
5.  A lean, agile and learning 
organisation
Create a workplace where talented people can do 
their best and continue to develop, while ensuring 
we have the right capabilities to deliver our 
strategic priorities.
Reorganised to enable our workforce to better focus on our customers and the growth 
opportunities. The simplified structure has also strengthened accountability. 
Began to revamp our performance management framework to strengthen alignment 
of personal objectives and incentives to the Group strategy.
Complete the revamp of our talent 
management framework.
Roll out the TT Way management framework and 
align behaviours with performance and incentives. 
Align our capabilities and the strategic priority 
requirements through training.
6.  Financial discipline and  
performance management
Emphasis on transparency, openness and 
accountability in financial control and 
performance management.
Placed greater emphasis on all elements of working capital management and cash 
generation; incentive targets are aligned to ensure that our spending is properly 
controlled. Cash conversion improved significantly during 2015 (see Financial review 
on page 39 for more information).
Introduced a new, standardised process to review budgets/forecasts, with a focus on 
transparency and challenge, and a greater emphasis on business insight.
Continue to improve the control environment through 
a Group-wide process and controls improvement plan. 
Drive process optimisation and automisation 
where appropriate.
Strengthen tracking of other leading indicators, 
market and other trend data.

 CEO’s Report
Paul Crevello
Chief Executive Officer
2010 was an extremely positive year for Bahamas 
Petroleum Company and 2011 has had a very strong 
start with the new 2D seismic, share placing and 
initiation of the 3D seismic survey.
Dear Shareholder,
I am writing to you for the first time  
as Chief Executive of Bahamas 
Petroleum Company plc and have the 
good fortune to tell our shareholders 
that the past year has seen significant 
advances in our exploration programme. 
Highlights
 significant growth in shareholder 
value in the last quarter of 2010 
based, we believe, on the positive 
results of our seismic programmes 
and the investors’ belief in a sound 
exploration programme with very 
significant upside potential. 

first modern seismic survey in the 
southern Bahamas since 1987. 
Results of our 2D seismic surveys 
reveal giant structures up to 70 km 
long, with four-way vertical closure 
from 100 m to substantially over a 
kilometre which, in the view of the 
Board of the Company, are very 
exciting prospects. 

seismic, the Company has applied 
for two additional licences that 
cover an approximate total of 
6,210 km

 or 1,534,600 acres. 
These applications are currently 
under review by The Bahamian 
government.
 
of award with CGGVeritas to 
initiate a 3D seismic survey over 
the southern licences to further 
de-risk these prospects. 

Company completed placings  
of £20.6 million and £25 million 
respectively before expenses 
which has put the Company in a 
strong financial position, with the 
necessary financing now in place 
to accelerate its exploration 
programme. This raise has 
expanded the Company’s 
shareholder base with new 
institutions, whilst also receiving 
strong support from existing 
shareholders.
 
is progressing well and the 
companies have initiated an 
environmental impact assessment 
over Cay Sal Bank as requested 
by The Bahamian government.  
This will move forward the licence 
application process.

11 The Company advanced its 
exploration programme in 2010 and 
the first quarter of 2011 by acquiring 
the first 2D seismic survey in the 
southern region of The Bahamas in 
over 25 years. The Company engaged 
Spectrum ASA to acquire an initial 
test survey of 194 km of 2D data 
designed to demonstrate the 
advances in modern seismic 
acquisition and technology over the 
vintage (1987 and older) seismic data. 
The vintage data was used by the 
Company to define the prospective 
500 million barrel leads reported in 
the Competent Persons Report 
published in 2007. 
The 2D seismic survey twinned 
selected vintage lines providing direct 
comparison of the new versus old 
seismic data. The test survey was 
unique in that we employed a 10 km 
long seismic cable versus the industry 
standard of 6 to 8 km. Previous 
vintage 1987 data was acquired using 
a short 4 km recording streamer.  
The longer cable and associated 
recording parameters were used 
because of the large size of the 
prospects, the broad curvature of  
the folds and the necessity to image 
deeper subsalt objectives. The 
Company took advantage of a seismic 
vessel transiting the region, resulting 
in significant cost savings.
The fully processed, Pre-Stack Time 
Migrated (PSTM) 2010 seismic data 
suggests that hydrocarbons are 
present in the southern area, 
indicated by what industry calls direct 
hydrocarbon indicators (DHI’s). DHI’s 
are interpreted indirectly by dim zones 
above the crest of structures, phase/
polarity changes at the crest of 
structures or by open sea floor vents, 
i.e. natural sea floor seeps, which are 
commonly associated with oil fields. 
The DHI’s, especially the vents, 
indicate an actively generating 
petroleum system.
Following the success of the June 
2010 survey, the Company engaged 
SeaBird Exploration (Osprey Explorer 
Vessel) in January 2011 and acquired 
a comprehensive, closely spaced 2D 
seismic survey in the southern fold 
belt. This survey was another first for 
the Company and The Bahamas in 
that it was the only closely spaced 
mid-water depth (i.e. ~ 500 m deep) 
survey to be undertaken in the 
southern Bahamas designed to map 
prospects. The survey (5 km to 10 km 
grid) focused on mapping the large 
fold belt prospects in our southern 
licences. The results are significant  
in that they define at least six major 
prospects that range in aerial size 
from 33 km
2
 (8,150 acres) to 465 km
2
 
(114,900 acres). Vertical 4-way 
closure, which is the maximum 
possible height for hydrocarbons  
to fill the structure, range from 100 m 
to as much as 1.5 km or more, 
depending on rock velocity 
properties. The seismic lines and 
associated maps clearly demonstrate 
the giant size and extent of the newly 
mapped prospects. This data is 
undergoing full processing through 
PSTM and will be passed on to Ryder 
Scott Consultants who will complete 
a resource evaluation of the prospects 
by the end of summer 2011.
The Company has awarded a 3D 
seismic contract to CGGVeritas to 
survey over the southern fold belt, 
which the Company will use to de-risk 
and prioritise the prospect portfolio. 
The Company intends to undertake  
a 2D survey over its northern licence 
where oil shows and a gas condensate 
reservoir were encountered in the 
Great Isaac #1 well. 
The joint venture licence application 
with Statoil over Cay Sal Bank  
is continuing to progress. The 
government of The Bahamas has 
requested that we undertake an 
Environmental Impact Assessment 
(EIA) over the bank as part of the 
steps of moving the licences forward 
to the review and approval stage and 
these licences were gazetted on  
22 April 2010 as part of this process. 
The 2010 BP Macondo oil spill 
created a global shock wave across 
the industry and caused governments 
to reassess their drilling policies and 
procedures. The government of The 
Bahamas requested that the EIA 
evaluate the potential risks of our 
exploration area/programme as a 
prerequisite to awarding the licences. 
We expect to have clarification on the 
awarding of these licences upon 
completion of the EIA evaluation.
At the year end, the Company had 
US$6.1 million in cash and has firmly 
raised an additional US$31.4 million 
(£20.6 million) before expenses in 
March 2011, with a further US$37.9 
million (£25 million) before expenses 
which followed shareholder approval 
at an Extraordinary General Meeting 
held on 11 April 2011. The proceeds 
will go towards the acquisition of  
3D seismic and 2D shallow seismic 
(US$35.2 million), Geochemical 
sniffer/multibeam (US$6.4 million)  
and the remainder (US$27.7 million) 
on working capital and other 
exploration costs.
All in all, 2010 was an extremely 
positive year for the Company and 
2011 has already got off to a very 
strong start with the new 2D seismic, 
share placing and initiation of the 3D 
seismic survey. 
Outlook
I anticipate that 2011 will see 
significant growth in the Company, 
with the potential completion of 
further farm-ins to best position the 
Company, such that we enter 2012 
ready to drill our first of these giant-
size prospects. The Board continues 
to look to the future with confidence.
Yours sincerely,
Paul Crevello,
Chief Executive Officer

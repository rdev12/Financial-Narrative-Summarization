Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
VYVANSE
$1,449m
2013 $1,228m
ADHD
VYVANSE product sales grew strongly (up 18%) 
in 2014 primarily due to the benefi t of price 
increases and to a lesser extent higher US 
prescription demand and growth in ex-US 
product sales. This growth was partially 
offset by a lower level of stocking in 2014 
as compared to 2013.
LIALDA/MEZAVANT
$634m
2013 $529m
Ulcerative Colitis
The 20% growth in product sales for LIALDA/
MEZAVANT in 2014 was primarily driven by 
higher prescription demand (up 25%) and to 
a lesser extent a price increase taken at the 
beginning of 2014. The growth was partially 
offset by a lower level of stocking and higher 
sales deductions as a percentage of sales in 
2014 as compared to 2013.
ELAPRASE
$593m
2013 $546m
Hunter syndrome
ELAPRASE sales growth was up 9% (up 11% 
on a CER basis), driven by continued growth 
in the number of treated patients, especially 
in emerging markets. Sales growth was also 
negatively impacted by foreign exchange.
CINRYZE
$503m
2013 n/a
For the prophylactic treatment of Hereditary 
Angioedema
Shire acquired CINRYZE through its acquisition 
of ViroPharma on January 24, 2014. CINRYZE 
sales were $503 million in 2014, growing 30% 
on a pro-forma basis on 2013
1
 primarily driven 
by more patients on therapy and to a lesser 
extent the impact of a price increase in the US, 
and an increase in channel inventory.
REPLAGAL
$500m
2013 $468m
Fabry disease
REPLAGAL sales were up 7% compared to 
2013 (up 10% on a CER basis), driven primarily 
by higher unit sales as we continue to see an 
increase in the number of patients on therapy 
with good growth in emerging markets and to a 
lesser extent Europe. The benefi t of higher unit 
sales was partially offset by foreign exchange.
ADDERALL XR
$383m
2013 $375m
ADHD
ADDERALL XR product sales were up 2% 
in 2014, as a result of higher prescription 
demand, partially offset by lower stocking 
in 2014 compared to 2013.
VPRIV
$367m
2013 $343m
Gaucher disease
VPRIV sales were up 7% (up 8% on a CER 
basis), driven by a strong performance in the 
EU and US as we continue to add naïve 
patients and gain patients switching from other 
therapies. Sales growth was also negatively 
impacted by foreign exchange.
FIRAZYR
$364m
2013 $235m
For the treatment of acute HAE attacks
FIRAZYR sales growth was up 55% compared 
to 2013, driven by a higher number patients on 
therapy and the effect of a price increase in the 
US market.
INTUNIV
$327m
2013 $335m
ADHD
INTUNIV product sales were down 2% 
compared to 2013, refl ecting the impact of 
generic competition from December 2014, 
resulting in lower prescription demand, 
signifi cantly higher sales deductions as a 
percentage of product sales and destocking as 
compared to a slight level of stocking in 2013. 
This was partially offset by price increases taken 
in 2014. The impact of generic competition saw 
INTUNIV market share fall to 2.3% at the end of 
2014 from 4.6% at the beginning of the year.
PENTASA
$290m
2013 $281m
Ulcerative Colitis
PENTASA product sales were up 3% as the 
benefi t of price increases was partially offset by 
higher sales deductions and a lower prescription 
demand in 2014 compared to 2013.

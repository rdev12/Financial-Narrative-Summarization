maintained its competitive position 
and support from its customers  
by winning new contracts with an 
aggregate value in excess of USD 930 
million during 2012. Notably in our 
recent statement on 6 February 2013, 
we were pleased to announce that 
the Jindal Group had awarded  
a new contract to Lamprell for one 
conﬁrmed, together with one optional, 
jackup rig.
In another positive development, 
Lamprell signed a joint venture 
agreement for the fabrication, 
refurbishment and repair of land 
drilling rigs in Saudi Arabia, enhancing 
our strong presence in that market. 
We plan to leverage on our long-term 
relationships with our Saudi partners 
and our well-established expertise in 
the land rig sector.
Board and management changes
It has been a very busy year with 
changes both at the Board and at the 
management levels, some planned 
and others required in response to the 
events of 2012.
In October, Nigel McCue, Jon Cooper 
and Chris Hand stood down from 
their respective positions as Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer, Chief Financial 
Ofﬁcer and Chief Operating Ofﬁcer.  
At the same time, Peter Whitbread, 
who had previously served as 
Lamprell’s Chief Executive from 1992 
to 2009, was appointed to the Board 
as Interim Chief Executive Ofﬁcer.  
In November, Frank Nelson was 
appointed as Interim Chief Financial 
Ofﬁcer. Their efforts have ensured a 
smooth transition of the stabilised 
business to the new management 
team led by James (Jim) Moffat, 
whose appointment as the new Chief 
Executive Ofﬁcer was announced  
in early December. I am absolutely 
delighted that someone of Jim’s 
expertise and calibre has agreed  
to join our team. He assumed his 
responsibilities on 1 March 2013, and 
will bring the highest standards of 
leadership, engineering and project 
execution to Lamprell.
Business Review
Chairman’s Statement
A challenging year for Lamprell
At the time I took over as Lamprell’s 
Non-Executive Chairman in the 
middle of June 2012, the Company 
had already announced that there 
were signiﬁcant operational difﬁculties 
and delays in delivery of the wind farm 
installation vessel Windcarrier 1 Brave 
Tern. Unfortunately, as the Summer 
progressed, it became clear that the 
scale of these issues was far greater 
than previously anticipated, and that it 
affected other key contracts, including 
notably the Windcarrier 2 Bold Tern 
and the Caspian Sea jackup project.
On 3 October, the Board made the 
difﬁcult but necessary decision to 
replace the entire senior management 
team and directed the newly 
appointed, interim management team 
to reassess Lamprell’s business in 
light of the deteriorating ﬁnancial 
position. At the same time the Board 
appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers 
to conduct an independent review  
of the ﬁnancial performance of the 
underperforming projects. The results 
of this comprehensive assessment 
were announced on 19 November, 
revealing total projected losses far in 
excess of what had been previously 
anticipated or announced.
Despite the disappointing update, the 
Board worked closely with the interim 
management team to address the 
problems facing the business as 
efﬁciently and effectively as possible. 
During the following months, we 
made excellent progress in mitigating 
the losses from the underperforming 
key projects and stabilising the 
Group’s ﬁnancial position. With 
support from Lamprell’s lenders,  
we also began the process of 
restructuring the Group’s ﬁnancial 
arrangements which is expected to 
be completed in Q2 2013.
In spite of the setbacks of 2012, the 
durability of our industrial franchise 
continues to prove strong and  
our clients, especially our existing 
clients, have continued to place their 
trust in our ability to perform to high 
standards. As a result, Lamprell has 
2012 was unquestionably 
the most challenging year 
in Lamprell’s history. After 
years of sustained growth 
and proﬁtability, the 
Company experienced  
a number of signiﬁcant 
operational and reporting 
issues, which resulted  
in substantial ﬁnancial 
losses prompting the 
Board to make major 
changes to the way in 
which the business is 
structured and managed. 07 Lamprell plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
It was also pleasing that, after 
stepping down from his interim CEO 
role, Peter Whitbread has agreed  
to stay on as a Director to support 
Jim and his team in rebuilding the 
business and positioning it for  
future success.
Other Board changes in 2012 
included the retirement of Richard 
Raynaut and resignation of Brian 
Frederick as Directors, and the 
appointment of Deena Mattar as a 
Non-Executive Director with effect 
from 1 April 2012. Jonathan Silver 
stepped down from the position  
of Chairman to become Deputy 
Chairman, followed closely by  
my appointment on 15 June as 
Non-Executive Chairman.
Further Board changes will be taking 
place during the next few months.  
As a result of the considerable time 
commitment required of the Non-
Executive Directors during the past 
year, Colin Goodall and Deena Mattar 
have informed the Board that they will 
not be standing for re-election at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. 
A search is underway for additional 
independent Non-Executive Directors.
As a Board, it is our objective to 
deliver long-term, sustainable success 
for the beneﬁt of all Lamprell’s 
stakeholders. While there have been 
many changes at the most senior 
levels in the Company, I consider that 
the Board has reasserted its position 
to provide a clear direction and strong 
and effective leadership for the future 
of the business.
FSA investigation
In November 2012, Lamprell 
announced an investigation by the 
Financial Services Authority (“FSA”) 
into the Company’s handling of inside 
information. Having completed the 
investigation, the FSA imposed a ﬁne 
of approximately USD 3.7 million on 
Lamprell for failing in its obligations as 
a listed company to keep the market 
fully informed of its deteriorating 
ﬁnancial position during early 2012.
From early in 2012, Lamprell’s 
ﬁnancial performance began to 
deteriorate due to operational issues 
and to delays in completing key 
projects. It became clear that the 
Company’s systems did not allow 
management to assess fully the 
impact of these operational issues. 
Lamprell was, therefore, unable to 
update the market in a timely manner 
as to its ﬁnancial performance. When 
the extent of the ﬁnancial deterioration 
was recognised, the FSA concluded 
that Lamprell did not act sufﬁciently 
quickly to update the market or to 
prevent employees from continuing  
to deal in its shares once the inside 
information regarding the poor 
ﬁnancial performance had been 
recognised. The steps that the 
Company has taken to improve its 
systems and controls are set out in 
the Corporate Governance report.
Dividends
Given the post-tax losses in 2012, 
Lamprell will not pay a dividend  
for the year. We look into the future 
with optimism, and will review our 
dividend policy once the business 
returns to proﬁtability.
Outlook
As a result of the events of 2012,  
the Company has been forced to 
re-evaluate its business structure  
and the projects that it wishes to 
pursue. We have had to make many 
signiﬁcant changes to the business,  
to return to our core activities, but it  
is important to reafﬁrm the underlying 
strength of the Company’s franchise 
and its sustainable competitive 
advantages in the marketplace. As 
previously mentioned, the continued 
and ongoing support of our customers 
has been particularly heartening. 
On behalf of all the employees and 
Directors of Lamprell, I would like to 
express our appreciation.
Despite continued global 
macroeconomic uncertainty, demand 
for our products and services remains 
strong in the midst of a robust and 
expansive oil and gas industry. In 
particular, we see a steady stream of 
new build and refurbishment projects 
in our home market of the Middle  
East as well as increased activity in 
the North Sea. In recent years there 
have been signiﬁcant changes in our 
competitive landscape, in particular 
the entry of Asian players who can 
offer very competitive ﬁnancial 
incentives to clients. However, we  
are conﬁdent that Lamprell’s strong, 
historic track record of delivery and 
continued commitment to quality 
positions the Company well to beneﬁt 
from continued growth in the oil  
and gas industry. Our current order 
book of USD 1.3 billion and the bid 
pipeline of USD 4.1 billion collectively 
represent a solid foundation for the 
business to grow in the coming years.
In light of the above, I sincerely believe 
that Lamprell can look forward to 
2013 and beyond with renewed 
conﬁdence. During 2013, we will be 
focusing on our traditional areas of 
strength, namely new build jackup 
rigs, rig refurbishment and offshore 
platform construction. With the strong 
bidding activity across the business  
in these areas, we expect this year to 
show signs of stability returning with 
the ﬁrst shoots of growth appearing 
towards the end of the year.
On behalf of the Board, I would like  
to thank all of Lamprell’s stakeholders 
and in particular our employees for 
their continued trust and support 
during these challenging times.

social Care
The group’s Social Care activities comprise 
the Residential Care, Community Care and 
Specialist Care divisions, which are commented 
on individually below. Aggregate Social Care 
revenue has increased by 5% with a fall in 
adjusted operating profit of 4%. The reduced 
operating margin reflects the cost implications 
of the additional holiday entitlements arising 
under the Work and Families Act 2006, which 
impacted the prior year for only six months, 
as well as the impact of start-up operations 
in Residential Care and operational challenges 
in Community Care.
Residential Care 
The Residential Care division achieved 
growth in revenue and operating profit 
of 6% and 3% respectively. The total 
number of beds at the end of the financial 
year, including day care places, was 3,533 
compared with 3,303 at the beginning 
of the year. Fee rates in the year averaged 
£642 per week compared with £621 in the 
previous year, an increase of 3.4%. The level 
of fee rate increase achieved during the 
year partly reflects the effect of a lower 
RPI index level than in previous years; 
despite this the underlying margin within 
the Residential Care division has been 
maintained. The mature level of financial 
occupancy in the year (“beds paid for”) 
was 96% and the mature level of physical 
occupancy was 90%, both measures 
excluding the two new homes opened 
during the year. These measures compare 
favourably with other market participants 
and demonstrate the benefit of our 
increasing focus on high dependency 
dementia care.
Oak House, the new residential care facility 
in Slough, and Manor Lodge, the new build 
120-bed care home in Chelmsford, both 
opened in March 2009. These homes are 
focussed on providing complex dementia 
care and have flexible registration and home 
layout arrangements enabling them to serve 
a changing mix of nursing, residential and 
respite care services. The initial aggregate 
occupancy build up in these two units 
has been encouraging.
We are pleased to have signed the 
contract for the provision of a 92-bed 
care home in Portsmouth. As reported 
previously, the contract element of this 
development is for 25 years for 62 beds. 
Construction of the home has now 
commenced and will be funded by 
Portsmouth City Council. We expect 
to open the home in autumn 2010.
As reported in the August Interim 
Management Statement, planning 
permission has been received for the 
development of a new 74-bed residential 
care home in Crowborough, east Sussex, 
targeted primarily at the self-pay market 
for older people with higher acuity dementia 
needs. Construction is due to start shortly 
and service delivery is expected to commence 
by spring 2011. This home does not have 
any block contracted beds.
The acquisition of a further site in 
the South east has now been agreed, 
subject to the receipt of suitable planning 
permission, for the development of a new 
70-bed care home targeted primarily at 
the self-pay market. Assuming a six-month 
period for achieving planning permission, 
this home would be expected to open 
towards the end of calendar year 2011.
We are continuing to evaluate a range 
of growth opportunities in Residential Care 
and have a number of potential new 
developments that we expect to 
approve in the forthcoming year.
Community Care 
After achieving a compound average 
annual growth rate in revenue of 19% 
over the previous six years, the Community 
Care division delivered revenue growth 
of 5% in 2009, all of which was organic.

Extraordinary performance – 
product/service extension
Peninsula tops the national league table 
of istCs. t o date the hospital has treated 
over 15,000 patients and delivers well 
above the utilisation rates expected by 
local commissioners.
The hospital provides a range of in-patient 
orthopaedic surgery and minor day cases supported 
by physiotherapy and diagnostics. In July this year 
an outreach service was launched to provide 
orthopaedic surgery to people living in Cornwall. 
Patient experience at Peninsula is exceptional with 
95% of patients rating their care as “excellent” or 
“good”. Patient satisfaction is a significant driver of the 
hospital’s success: over 58% of patient referrals result 
from recommendation by family or friends. The hospital 
has never had a case of MRSA or C-difficile.
A new knee allowed one patient at Peninsula 
to climb the mast of the STS Lord Nelson tall ship 
just a few months after her operation. Sylvia, 71, 
who had sufffered pain and lost mobility before 
her operation, told us “the physiotherapists were 
excellent in getting me up and about and the levels 
of cleanliness were exceptional.”
98% 
of Care UK patients say they would recommend 
our hospitals to family and friends.
Care UK
is the largest independent sector provider of both 
primary and secondary services to nHs patients.
“ I could not have had better care. I really 
felt I was being nursed to get better. ”

Delivering customised 
complex care packages 
at Pinetum, Cheshire
Complex care is required by individuals with 
high frequency or unpredictable nursing or 
care needs. Pinetum residential care home 
brings together multi-disciplinary teams 
including consultants, PCts, physiotherapists, 
risk managers and itU nurses to deliver 
customised complex care packages.
George was admitted to hospital following a 
collapse at home resulting from respiratory arrest. 
Whilst in hospital he was diagnosed with Motor 
Neurone Disease and other complications. 
Following a prolonged stay in an Intensive 
Treatment Unit (“ITU”) and an acute ward, 
the hospital team trained the staff at Pinetum 
to care for George and manage his equipment. 
Thanks to the team at Pinetum, George was able 
to be cared for in a more appropriate setting and 
his family and friends were able to maintain 
regular contact reducing the potential of any 
emotional and social isolation.

social Care continued
Community Care continued
The group has chosen to focus on 
performance improvement during the 
year and to temporarily suspend acquisition 
led growth, which has historically delivered 
around half of total revenue growth.
The reduced operating profit within 
Community Care reflects the previously 
reported operational costs of stabilising 
the Harrow branch and additional central 
management resources required to resolve 
immediate operational challenges and to 
enhance our prospects for further growth. 
Branch level performance in this division 
showed an operating margin at a similar 
level to 2008. The run rate operating profit 
in the last quarter of the financial year 
has shown some encouraging signs of 
improvement and we remain confident 
that the actions that have been taken will, 
in time, result in returning the division to 
similar levels of profitability experienced 
in previous years.
As well as those reported with the interim 
results, new and renewed contracts have 
been awarded in Sheffield, Brighton, 
Peterborough, Derby and Darlington. 
At 30 September 2009, the weekly total 
of hours of care provided amounted to 
around 123,000, representing like-for-like 
growth in the year of around 2.5%, 
excluding the terminated Hertfordshire 
contract. The total hours delivered in the 
year amounted to around 6.3m compared 
with 6.2m in the previous year.
Specialist Care 
Specialist Care has delivered growth in 
revenue and operating profit of 5% and 4% 
respectively, all of which is organic growth. 
Across the division we have seen an increase 
of approximately 8% in the average number 
of service users being cared for.
The Mental Health business achieved 
revenue growth of 9% and a good 
improvement in the operating margin, 
mainly through better occupancy levels 
in higher value-added services such as 
specialist eating disorders and self-harm.
In Learning Disabilities, revenue growth 
of around 11% was achieved following the 
start of a number of new services resulting 
in growth in the year of around 17% in the 
number of service users cared for. Almost 
90% of service users are looked after in 
independent supported living environments, 
the preferred form of care of service 
commissioners. The operating margin for 
the year reflected the start-up nature of 
these new services and was consequently 
slightly lower than the previous year. 
In Children’s Services we saw a revenue 
reduction of 12% over the previous year 
but a similar operating profit contribution, 
as expected, as a result of the rationalisation 
of capacity undertaken in the latter part 
of 2008 and early 2009. encouragingly, 
we have seen a much stronger performance 
from this business in the second half, 
showing the benefits of the action taken. 
Social Care strategy and outlook
It is clear that Local Government finances 
will be under pressure during the coming 
years and funding for social care has not 
received the same level of commitment by 
the main political parties as health care 
funding. However, we believe there is little 
room for further retrenchment of funding 
for the type of higher acuity service that 
we are increasingly focussing on as Local 
Authorities are now typically supporting 
hard core dependency requirements only 
and demographic trends are expected to 
add to demand rather than ease pressure.
As a consequence, Local Authorities 
are increasingly focussing on initiatives 
to deliver better value. These include 
further challenges to costly in-house supply,

social Care continued
Specialist Care continued
Social Care strategy and outlook continued
avoidance of unnecessary low dependency 
residential care placements and reductions 
in the number of suppliers in order to 
benefit from logistical synergy.
In addition, as illustrated in the recent 
Green Paper on the future of social care, 
“Shaping the Future of Care Together”, 
there is a growing expectation that greater 
levels of personal contribution to the cost 
of care will be required, whether self or 
insurance funded. 
Larger providers such as Care UK 
are better placed to leverage synergies, 
invest in cost-effective systems and provide 
consistently high-quality services to meet the 
needs of ever more dependent service users.
Given these industry trends, Care UK 
remains strongly committed to its Social 
Care business and our strategy is to continue 
to drive operational excellence to further 
improve our organic growth as well as 
gaining greater scale through carefully 
targeted acquisitions at the right price.
Care UK is already one of the best rated 
care organisations by the CQC with almost 
90% of all of the group’s Social Care services 
rated as “excellent” or “good” and our 
employees work constantly to achieve 
ever higher rates of service excellence.
Health Care 
The Health Care business has shown 
good improvement in financial performance 
compared with 2008, with revenue increasing 
by 54% and adjusted operating profit 
increasing by 44%. The full ownership 
of PHG for the full year, compared with 
only two months in the prior year, has 
contributed significantly to this level of 
growth. In addition, the two new Phase 2 
ISTC schemes commissioned in the first half, 
in Manchester and Southampton, have 
contributed around £24.5m of revenue 
in aggregate. As expected during their 
ramp-up periods, these two new contracts 
have delivered an aggregate break-even 
position. The underlying performance in 
Health Care – adjusting for full ownership of 
PHG and excluding the Phase 2 ISTC services 
and the West Midlands diagnostics contract 
in 2008 – saw growth of just over 12% in 
revenue with a similar operating margin 
being achieved.
Primary Care 
The Primary Care business now comprises 
over 40 operating sites delivering a range 
of services focussed around GP services, out 
of hours and walk-in services, diagnostics 
and CATS services and prison health. During 
the year a total of twelve new contracts 
have been awarded, of which all but one 
are now operational; the final service is due 
to commence in 2010. All but one of these 
contracts has been awarded under the 
Department of Health’s (“DoH”) “equitable 
Access to Primary Medical Care Services” 
procurement programme and will facilitate 
the creation of stronger customer relationships 
with the commissioning PCTs. The aggregate 
revenue from these contracts will amount to 
around £18m when fully operational. Since 
the year end we have been appointed as 
preferred bidder on a further two contracts. 
The Greater Manchester CATS service 
commenced operational delivery in 
February 2009 as planned. This service 
is provided by highly sophisticated mobile 
units that deliver a range of outpatient 
services to NHS patients including the 
treatment of minor injuries, diagnostics and 
scanning, endoscopies and pre-operative 
assessments. Over the past three months we 
have seen significant growth in the use of 
the service with referral levels increasing by 
over 70% during this period. We have now 
also arranged to provide an eighth site in 
order to extend the benefits of the service 
to a higher number of potential patients. 
We are confident that 
independent providers have a 
crucial role to play in the future 
provision of NHS services.

OUR LONG-TERM INVESTMENT FOR FUTURE GROWTH 
Inmarsat is a world-leading commercial satellite operator with several hundred years  
of experience among its team of world-class satellite engineers. We have consistently  
flown our satellites beyond their original life expectancy and we have a flawless launch  
record over the last 25 years. 
For decades, Inmarsat has been a trusted partner to the US Government 
and today we support over 100 nations around the world. We augment a 
government’s existing communications networks and ensure that, wherever 
they need to be, our secure, reliable and powerful mobile satellite networks 
are readily available. Through our mission-critical voice, video and data 
communications solutions, we support governments in maintaining their 
security, in ensuring public safety, and in delivering a range of remote health, 
education and other crucial services in regions where high-quality terrestrial 
networks are not available.

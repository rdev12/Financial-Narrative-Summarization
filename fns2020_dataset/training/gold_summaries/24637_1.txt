 HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 14
I am extremely proud to announce today’s 
record results which show rental levels, 
investment gains, pre-tax profits, 
shareholders’ funds and EPRA net asset 
value per share all at the highest level in 
Helical’s 32 year history as a real estate 
company . These results clearly demonstrate 
that our strategy of targeting London for 
capital growth and development profits and 
the regions for higher yielding investment 
assets provides the most appropriate 
allocation of resources to enable us to 
meet our long term objectives. 
The greatest proportion of our performance this year has come 
from London where we have increased our portfolio weighting, 
primarily with the purchase of The Bower EC1. We also increased 
our weighting in industrial assets whilst reducing our exposure to 
retail. We sold our Polish assets and continue to deliver on our 
retirement village programme. 
Within the investment portfolio we have a strong and diverse tenant 
profile. We have increased contracted rents by £12.7m (29% increase) 
from new lettings and by capturing some of the reversionary 
potential of the portfolio and expect this growth to continue. Our 
London investment portfolio remains highly reversionary and its 
inherent value will be unlocked through the completion of our 
redevelopment and refurbishment programme and the letting of 
the vacant and remaining reversionary space. London continues 
to outperform the rest of the UK and our strategy is to increase 
our London holdings. 
We now have an investment portfolio poised for future earnings 
growth which, if supported by a benign economic background, 
should lead to substantial capital appreciation. 
PERFORMANCE 
We measure our performance at both portfolio and Company level, 
seeking to outperform in the medium and long term relevant sector 
indices and our peer group.
EPRA earnings per share increased from 2.4p to 17.1p, reflecting 
growing net rental income and increased development profits. On 
a like-for-like basis, the investment portfolio increased by 14.9% 
(11.1% including sales and purchases) contributing to an overall 
growth in the portfolio to £1,240m (2015: £1,021m). The unleveraged 
return of our property portfolio, as measured by IPD, was 21.7% 
(2015: 20.4%), compared to 11.4% (2015: 17.5%) for the benchmark 
index. These investment gains contributed to an increase in EPRA 
net asset value per share, up 19.7% to 461p (2015: 385p). Since the 
start of 2016, the listed real estate sector has been affected by 
concerns over global economic issues and the forthcoming 
referendum on our membership of the European Union. Despite 
this, we achieved a positive Total Shareholder Return for the year 
to 31 March 2016 of 1.0% (2015: 7.6%), compared to the sector 
index which fell by 6.4% (2015: increase of 22.8%).

RESULTS FOR THE YEAR
The profit before tax for the year to 31 March 2016 was £120.1m 
(2015: £87.4m), the highest in the Group’s history. Total Property 
Return increased by 10% to £170.6m (2015: £155.3m) and included 
growing net rents of £43.4m, an increase of 12% on 2015 (£38.6m), 
and development profits of £27.5m (2015: £17.6m). The gain on 
sale and revaluation of the investment portfolio contributed £99.7m 
(2015: £96.6m) and there were no trading profits (2015: £2.5m). 
Net finance costs of £22.6m were lower than in 2015 (£24.8m), 
however the income statement was adversely affected by falls in 
expected future interest rates which led to a £6.9m (2015: £8.4m) 
charge arising from the valuation of the Group’s derivative 
financial instruments. The valuation of the Group’s Convertible 
Bond provided a credit of £0.5m (2015: charge of £3.3m). 
Recurring administration costs were marginally higher at £10.7m 
(2015: £10.2m). Performance related awards, reflecting the success 
of the Group’s activities in the year were £13.3m (2015: £13.4m). 
National Insurance costs on remuneration, including performance 
related awards, were £2.1m (2015: £3.0m).
These results allow the Board to continue its progressive dividend 
policy and to recommend to shareholders a final dividend of 0.72p 
which, together with the two interim dividends paid to date of 
7.45p takes the total dividend for the year to 8.17p (2015: 7.25p), 
an overall increase of 12.7%.
THE LONDON PORTFOLIO
The London investment and development portfolio continues to 
contribute the greater proportion of capital growth and development 
profits. In the year to 31 March 2016, London provided c. 80% of 
the total property return of £170.6m (2015: £155.3m). 
Since 2010 we have steadily acquired property in two “clusters”; 
the Tech Belt districts of Farringdon, Shoreditch, Aldgate and 
through to Whitechapel and the West London districts of 
Hammersmith, Shepherds Bush and Chiswick.
The East 
At The Bower EC1, we have acquired the outstanding 2/3rd interest 
from our joint venture partner Crosstree Real Estate Partners LLP 
(“Crosstree”), of the buildings known as The Warehouse (122,858 
sq ft of offices, 5,404 sq ft of restaurant use) and The Studio 
(18,283 sq ft of offices, 4,894 sq ft of restaurant use). Construction 
work on these two buildings was completed in November 2015 
and both are fully let at average office rents of £55.00 psf and 
£43.85 psf respectively. In addition, we have acquired The Tower 
at 207 Old Street, a 179,000 sq ft refurbishment and extension of 
the existing building on which work has commenced and is due 
for completion Q1 2018. At £248m, this purchase is our largest 
ever acquisition and strongly reaffirms our belief in the London 
office market. The remaining buildings at The Bower, being Empire 
House and the retail parade, were sold by the joint venture to 
Standard Life and Crosstree respectively.
At Barts Square EC1, our scheme in joint venture with The Baupost 
Group LLC, we have now exchanged contracts for sale at an 
average of £1,580 psf on 102 of the 144 residential units with a 
further two units reserved in phase 1 of the development which is 
due for completion in summer 2017. The office development of 
212,858 sq ft at One Bartholomew Close EC1 has been forward 
funded with clients of Ashby Capital, is currently under construction 
and is due for completion in July 2018.
Our 272,426 sq ft office development at One Creechurch Place EC3, 
equity funded with our joint venture partner HOOPP (Healthcare 
of Ontario Pension Plan) is expected to complete in September 
2016. C-Space EC1 completed its refurbishment in October 2015 
and is 75% let at an average rent of £56 psf. At 23-28 Charterhouse 
Square EC1 we have commenced construction works, due to 
complete in Q1 2017 on a refurbishment which will comprise 
38,500 sq ft of offices and 5,100 sq ft of retail/restaurant use.  
Our 112,000 sq ft listed building at The Loom, Whitechapel E1 is 
now undergoing a comprehensive refurbishment and is due for 
completion in September 2016.
The West
There has been substantial growth in rents at our West London 
properties. At Shepherd’s Building W14 we have completed the 
lease renewal and increased the space let to our largest tenant 
Endemol, increasing the rent by £1.25m pa, with average rents for 
the building now £45.75 psf. At One King Street W6 following the 
completion of the refurbishment works, we have achieved a 
benchmark rent for the area of £55.00 psf. We have added to  
our portfolio with the acquisition of Power Road Studios W4, 
62,000 sq ft of offices over five buildings acquired for £34m. 
THE REGIONAL PORTFOLIO
The regional investment and development portfolio provides a 
growing stream of net rents from a high yielding investment 
portfolio while contributing development profits from our 
retirement village and retail development programmes. 
The regional investment portfolio increased to £460m at 31 March 
2016 (2015: £420m) with the addition of 13 distribution warehouses 
and a regional office for an aggregate £94m, offset by the sale of 
eight distribution warehouses, five retail assets and three regional 
offices for £67m. Regional assets contributed £31.0m of net rental 
income during the year (2015: £30.7m) which is expected to 
continue to grow with contracted rents on the portfolio of £32m 
and an ERV of £36m. Net gains on the sale and revaluation of the 
regional portfolio contributed £6.7m (2015: £18.8m).
Our regional development exposure is limited to our retirement 
village and out-of-town retail development programmes and our 
Scottish Power project in Glasgow, where balance sheet risk is 
limited. At our retirement village development programme we 
continued the construction of units at Durrants Village Horsham, 
Millbrook Village Exeter and Maudslay Park Great Alne, near 
Stratford-upon-Avon. During the year we completed the clubhouse 
at Durrants Village and sold 33 residential units at the three schemes 
(2015: 25 units). In our retail development programme, we have 
completed our scheme at Shirley, West Midlands and continue to 
make progress on our scheme at Truro. Subsequent to the year end 
we forward funded a 79,750 sq ft out-of-town retail development 
at Cortonwood with a client of Aberdeen Asset Management. The 
Scottish Power project is pre-let and pre-sold and due for completion 
in September 2016. As part of the overall deal Helical takes on three 
existing Scottish Power sites which are surplus to requirements. 
One has been sold and good progress is being made on the 
business plans for the other two.  HELICAL BAR PLC REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2016 16
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
FINANCE
The Group has expanded its activities significantly in the last three 
years, seeking to increase shareholder funds through the generation 
and retention of increased net rental streams, development profits 
and valuation surpluses. This growth has been financed through an 
increase in secured debt borrowed primarily from UK high street 
banks and, since 2013, through the use of unsecured debt in the 
form of a retail bond and a convertible bond. In assessing the needs 
of the business the Company is conscious that it needs to manage 
any risks inherent in this leveraged approach to growing the business. 
It seeks to do this through the use of unsecured debt (23% of total 
debt), by increasing the maturity of its debt profile and by hedging 
its interest rate exposure. In addition, the Group’s debt profile 
includes borrowings in respect of residential and retirement village 
developments which are expected to be repaid as sales complete. 
In pursuing this strategy, the Group has increased the average debt 
maturity to 4.5 years (2015: 4.3 years), with no secured loan repayable 
before November 2019, whilst marginally increasing the average 
cost of debt at 4.2% (2015: 4.1%). The Group continues to retain a 
significant level of liquidity with cash and unutilised bank facilities 
of £193m (2015: £229m) to fund capital works on its portfolio. 
BOARD CHANGES
As previously announced with our half year results, I will be handing 
over the reins of the Company to Gerald Kaye, our senior development 
director for the last 22 years, and I will stand to be elected as  
Non-Executive Chairman, at the 2016 Annual General Meeting.  
At that AGM, Nigel McNair Scott, our current Chairman, former 
Finance Director and my close friend and confidant, will retire 
after 30 years on the Board. Nigel has proved to be a constant 
source of advice, support and wisdom during his time at Helical 
and I wish him a long and happy retirement. 
The AGM will also see the retirement of Andrew Gulliford, a 
Non-Executive director for the last ten years. Andrew has also 
proved to be a tremendous support to the Board and his 
contribution is greatly appreciated. With these two planned 
departures we have sought to strengthen the Board with the 
addition of two new independent Non-Executive Directors and 
were delighted to be able to announce the appointments of  
Susan Clayton and Richard Cotton earlier this year.
OUTLOOK
Since 2012, we have targeted an income producing investment 
portfolio representing at least 75% of our total property assets and 
a development programme of the remaining 25% which is capable 
of producing exceptional profits. We have now exceeded our original 
targets and, as we complete the current development programme 
over the next three years, our objectives are clear. We seek to:
•  Complete and let our London office schemes at The Bower, 
One Creechurch Place, One Bartholomew Close and 23-28 
Charterhouse Square; 
•  Complete the residential scheme at Barts Square and sell the 
remaining units;
•  Take forward our London schemes in Hammersmith and Drury 
Lane and at the appropriate time restock the London development 
pipeline to enable us to continue to create capital growth and 
development profits; 
• Capture the reversion in our investment portfolio; and,
• Maintain and grow a sustainable investment income surplus. 
We aim to do this against a background of increasing uncertainty, 
exacerbated by the imminent possibility of the UK voting to leave 
the European Union. However, with substantially increased 
contracted rents on our portfolio and having de-risked our two 
largest London office developments at One Creechurch Place EC3 
and One Bartholomew Close EC1, Helical is well placed to deal 
with any headwinds that may come its way. 
Finally, this will be my last Chief Executive’s Statement after nearly 
32 years with the Company. I joined the Board on the 21 August 
1984 when the equivalent share price was around one pence per 
share giving a market capitalisation of circa £800,000 and with 
Helical Bar plc a steel company making reinforcement bars for  
the construction industry. I joined the Company to change things.  
A quick sale of the steel business followed by over 30 years as  
an entrepreneurial property company, Helical has grown to have  
a current market capitalisation of over £460m having distributed 
£276m to shareholders during that period. I now look forward to 
becoming Chairman and leave the Company in the excellent 
hands of my successor, Gerald Kaye, and the wider executive 
team who have an average tenure with the Company of a mere  
19 years! I look forward to continuing both on the Board and as 
the Company’s largest shareholder and am confident that Helical’s 
outperformance will continue.

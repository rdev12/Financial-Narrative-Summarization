The 2016 financial results are consistent with the Group’s 
established financial strategy of prioritising organic revenue growth 
whilst maintaining a broadly stable operating margin percentage.
Total Group revenue was $558.22m, which was 12% ahead of 
prior year. This growth measure was negatively influenced by the 
fact that the 2015 comparative contained an ‘extra’ week of sales 
due to a 53 week accounting period, in addition to which the 
reported revenue of our UK business was adversely affected by 
currency swings following the EU referendum in June. Adjusting 
for these two factors, the like-for-like revenue increase over 2015 
was 13%. On a similarly adjusted basis, revenue at the half year 
was up 15%, meaning that the growth rate in the second half of 
the year was slightly lower than that experienced in the first half. 
The North American business, which comprises 97% of Group 
revenue, continued to grow well ahead of the promotional 
products industry as a whole, which was estimated by US industry 
sources to have grown by approximately 3.1%. Fourth quarter 
trading patterns were disrupted, with order intake in October and 
November, particularly in respect of new customers, running 
markedly lower than the year to date run rate. This correlated 
directly with a six to eight week period of uncertainty leading up 
to, and immediately following, the US election. Leading indicators 
and order activity recovered towards the end of the year, with 
December performance returning to anticipated levels.
Reported revenue for the UK operation was 2% lower than prior 
year. This result should, however, be set firmly in the context of the 
material currency movements following the EU referendum in late 
June. In underlying currency the year on year growth rate was 11%, 
also well above the estimated UK industry growth rate of 6.1%.

Report Overview
More than 240,000 new customers were acquired in 2016. On a 
like-for-like basis orders from new customers were up 6% over 
prior year, and orders from existing customers increased by 15% 
compared to 2015. In total, 1,054,000 individually customised 
orders were processed by our dedicated and talented customer 
service teams – the first time that more than a million orders have 
been received in one year.
Effective and innovative marketing is the key driver of our 
continued growth. During 2016 we continued to invest a 
significant proportion of our overall marketing funds into customer 
acquisition activities. In addition to our well-established offline 
prospecting initiatives, a critical part of the 2016 marketing mix 
involved understanding and developing strategies around changes 
in the dynamics of the search engine platforms which take up a 
large part of our online marketing budget. Customer retention was 
driven in large part by our ever-popular and constantly evolving 
Blue Box™ sample mailings, complemented by our relentless focus 
on delivering remarkable customer service. Revenue per marketing 
dollar is the KPI used to assess whether our increasing investment 
in marketing remains consistent with our strategy. In 2016 this was 
$5.77, compared to $5.92 in 2015. This was in line with our 
expectations and with our financial strategy, delivering both 
organic revenue growth and a stable operating margin percentage.
Underlying operating profit, excluding Head Office expenses, 
increased by 14%, compared to a 12% increase in reported 
revenue. The resulting increase in operating margin percentage in 
the trading businesses had three major components: (i) a slightly 
improved gross margin percentage; (ii) improved revenue per 
payroll dollar, effectively offsetting the movement in revenue per 
marketing dollar; and (iii) some gearing effect from the fixed or 
semi-fixed elements in selling costs and other overheads. 
Head office costs increased by 11% compared to prior period. 
There was no significant change in the structure and activities of 
the central function. The variance arose primarily due to losses on 
the maturity of forward currency contracts taken out before the EU 
referendum to hedge cash flows from the US, partly offset by a 
favourable currency effect from the translation into reporting 
currency of costs incurred in Sterling.  
Overall, the Group’s underlying operating margin percentage for 
2016 was 6.87%, compared to 6.74% in 2015. This is within the 
bandwidth to be consistent with our strategic intention to deliver a 
broadly stable operating margin percentage.
For the ninth year in a row, the North American business was 
named on the list of the Top 25 Best Medium Sized Workplaces in 
the USA. The UK business maintains its Investors in People 
accreditation. We are proud of our workplace and our culture, and 
as such we remain confident in our ability to innovate, adapt and 
continue to generate attractive levels of profitable organic growth.
Effective and innovative marketing is  
the key driver of our continued growth. 
During 2016 we continued to invest  
a significant proportion of our overall 
marketing funds into customer 
acquisition activities.

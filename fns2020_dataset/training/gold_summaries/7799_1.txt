This year has been one in which Ilika’s 
portfolio of technology and intellectual 
property ('IP') has matured in a number 
of key markets around the globe.  
The company’s IP can be divided into  
2 broad categories: 1) its platform 
technology for high throughput 
materials development and 2) the  
IP defining the materials, which have 
been developed using that platform.  
At the start of our last financial year,  
in May 2012, the Company received 
confirmation that its patent 
applications covering its core PVD 
patents had been granted in the US, 
Canada and Japan. The PVD technology 
was originally developed at the 
University of Southampton prior to the 
spin out of the Company in 2004. This 
technology has underpinned much of 
the materials innovation which the 
Company has undertaken since its 
formation and still provides the means 
by which the majority of the new 
materials being developed are initially 
made. Hence, in securing granted 
patents for this technology, the 
Company has secured the foundations 
for continued future growth.
The Company considers its core 
technology in high-throughput 
techniques to be a key differentiator 
from other providers of materials 
innovation. Ilika monetises this core 
technology through the development 
of the materials developed using that 
platform. Hence, continued progress 
made in securing IP, which defines  
the materials generated using the 
platform, and commercialising those 
materials is important to the Company. 
This past year has seen important 
milestones achieved across the 
Company’s portfolio, but particularly  
in the key area of energy storage  
and conversion.
The energy conversion materials, which 
are the most mature in Ilika’s portfolio, 
include the low-cost fuel cell electrode 
materials. Reducing the cost of fuel cell 
technology is widely acknowledged as 
a key priority for enabling its adoption 
for both transport and stationary 
applications. Ilika’s materials are 
suitable for use in so-called PEM fuel 
cells, which are of primary interest to 
transport applications. PEM fuel cell 
technology is also being used for 
stationary power applications, 
particularly for domestic power in 
Japan. 40 percent of the cost of a PEM 
fuel cell stack is currently associated 
with the use of platinum as the 
electrocatalyst. Platinum is a scarce 
precious metal and therefore its price 
is sensitive to supply and demand 
pressures. In 2012, the price of 
platinum varied between £28 and 
£35/g. At a typical loading of 11 g/kW, 
this means that an 80 kW fuel cell, 
which might be suitable for a small car, 
requires £2,500–£3,000 of platinum.  
In comparison, the total cost of buying 
an internal combustion engine lies  
in the range £500–£1,000. Ilika’s 
electrocatalysts cost 1/3 of the price, 
on a $/kW basis, of platinum-based 
equivalents. In September 2012,  
Ilika received a ca. £150,000 equity 
investment from the Carbon Trust  
to allow Ilika to complete the 
commercialisation of this technology. 
Since then, Ilika’s patents covering its 
technology have been granted in the 
US and Japan. In addition, Ilika’s 
development partner, ITRI of Taiwan, 
has delivered the first 1 kg of the 
catalyst for testing, primarily with 
OEMs in US and Japan, where Ilika has 
strong patent coverage. Materials 
transfer agreements have been put in 
place and initial samples have been 
made available for confirmatory 
testing at the OEMs. Initial feedback is 
encouraging and further testing is 
expected in this financial year.
In April 2012 Ilika announced that it 
had completed an equity round to fund 
the co-development of its solid-state 
battery technology, which it had 
co-developed with Toyota. Technical 
progress through Phase I of its 
development programme has been  
as expected, with optimisation of 
cell-based data continuing. An open 
channel of communication has been 
maintained with the US army, who 
expressed a strong interest in 
accessing this technology for man-
portable applications. Ilika is also 
pursuing commercial support for the 
technology from the consumer 
electronics and automotive sector.  12

Chief Executive’s 
review continued
Toyota is actively supporting Ilika 
within the automotive sector by 
co-presenting in June 2013 at a 
technology summit, the Advanced 
Automotive Battery Conference  
in Strasbourg.
An important streamlining of the 
business was completed in the last 
financial year. In December 2012, Ilika’s 
wholly-owned biomedical subsidiary, 
Altrika, was disposed of. The transaction 
involved the transfer of the cell-based 
burns treatment products Myskin®  
and Cryoskin® as well as the staff  
and facilities in Sheffield. The high-
throughput polymer platform was 
retained and operations were 
consolidated in Southampton. The 
transaction had a net positive effect 
on Ilika’s balance sheet and allowed 
Ilika to focus on its activities in the 
energy and electronics sector. At the 
end of his term as Non-Executive 
Director, Dr. Werner Braun, stepped 
down from Ilika’s Board in June 2013. 
Dr. Braun has particular expertise in 
the marketing of medical devices 
through his executive role at Biotronik.
The split of Ilika’s revenues across the 
globe continues to have an emphasis  
in Japan, with 78 percent coming from 
Japan, 9 percent from US and 13 
percent from Europe. In 2012, deal 
timelines and conversion rates 
deteriorated, causing the drop in 
reported revenues initially flagged in 
Ilika’s trading update in April 2013. 
Since then, the policy of quantitative 
easing pursued in Japan appears to 
have renewed corporate confidence, 
leading to an improved robustness in 
commercial outlook. Ilika’s core 
customer base has continued to renew 
relationships, as demonstrated by the 
contract renewals announced in 
December 2012 and February 2013. 
Further renewals of these relationships 
are expected in 2013. The Company 
has expectations of growth of the 
contribution of revenues from both  
the USA and Europe. The front end of 
the emerging opportunities in Europe 
was shown by the announcement of  
a new customer in the field of battery 
materials optimisation in April 2013. 
The need for improved energy storage 
and conversion continues to be  
a strong business driver for Ilika,  
which fits well with the Company’s 
core capabilities in being able to  
deliver optimised materials within  
accelerated timelines.

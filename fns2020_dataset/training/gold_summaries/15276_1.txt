Chief Executive’s report
Over view
We entered 2008 cautiously optimistic 
about the year, against what was seen 
at the time as a challenging environment, 
with rapidly rising raw material costs. 
As it has transpired, we now see a 
global financial crisis and an economic 
downturn far more severe than anyone 
had reasonably anticipated.
Against this background the Company 
has delivered a 5% improvement in 
underlying profit before tax and  
a substantial reduction in debt through 
four successful divestments. This must 
be seen as good progress given the 
circumstances.
Polymers (84% of sales) saw sales 
volumes decline by 3%, whilst increasing 
profit by 3% to £42.4 million. This was 
achieved in an environment of highly 
volatile raw material prices and a decline 
in global demand through the second 
half of the year.
We completed and successfully 
commissioned our third-phase nitrile 
capacity expansion in Malaysia to 
support our customers in the high growth 
global synthetic glove market. We remain 
the leading supplier to this market.  
We also completed the acquisition of 
a new dispersion business in Vietnam 
to support our global customers in the 
country and to gain a foothold in another 
high growth Asian economy.
Pharmaceuticals (11% of sales) saw  
a 28% decline in profit on revenues up 
3%. Margins were adversely impacted 
by rising raw material prices and a weak 
dollar in the first half of the year and 
customer destocking during the second 
half. We continued to reconfigure our 
production capacity with the phased 
closure of our Italian site and the transfer 
of a proportion of its production to our 
other sites. The Italian plant closure 
has been structured to support our 
major customers and it will fully cease 
production in the middle of 2009  
when product transfers are complete.  
A further six Drug Master Files (DMFs) 
were filed in the year as we continued 
the development of our generic pipeline.
We have now completed the sale of 
four of the five businesses that comprised 
the Impact Chemicals Division. We 
received £63 million of gross proceeds 
for these businesses, of which £10 million 
was received post the year end. The 
remaining business, William Blythe 
Limited, was restructured in the first 
quarter and subsequently returned to 
profit for the full year having been 
loss-making in 2007 .
Polymer 	 Chemicals
Polymers has manufacturing assets 
around the world and comprises 
Dispersion, Latex and various speciality 
polymers. Dispersions are principally 
used in surface coatings such as paint 
and varnish, adhesives such as wood 
glues and construction applications such 
as sealants and fillers. SBR latex  
is used in the manufacture of carpet floor 
coverings and construction materials 
such as speciality cement whilst NBR 
latex is mainly sold into the fast-growing 
nitrile glove market. Speciality polymers 
includes rubber, polymers to regulate 
PVC manufacture and sealants for the 
motor industry.
Polymer Division operates 19 production 
units on 13 sites within four geographical 
regions – Europe, South East Asia, 
Middle East and South Africa – and 
employs approximately 1,500 people. 
The core products of the Division are 
water-based polymers, based on vinyl 
acetate and acrylic co and terpolymer 
dispersions, styrene and nitrile butadiene 
rubber, as well as polyvinyl alcohol/
acetate, and a number of smaller 
specialist products serving a range  
of industries.
2008 was a year where all business 
units faced challenges on a number 
of fronts. The Division started the year 
very positively and made good progress 
through the first half. However, the 
growing turmoil in the global economy 
started to have its effect in a number of 
market segments in the third quarter and 
in all by the final quarter. Fluctuations 
in currency, availability and pricing of 
monomers, rising energy costs and 
slower customer demand all contributed 
to the creation of a very complex and 
difficult environment. However, against 
that background, the Division did 
continue to make progress in a  
number of areas.
The monomer supply position was, 
until the final quarter, extremely difficult. 
Rising oil prices and surging demand 
placed a strain on supply in a number 
of areas but, in particular, butadiene, 
where strong demand and lack of 
availability meant additional costs 
were incurred to ensure continuity of 
supply to our customers. This situation 
began to improve in the final quarter 
as demand dropped and oil prices 
followed. However monomer prices 
fell very rapidly, leading customers to 
destock their supply chains in the hope 
of securing lower input prices and 
resulted in further lowering demand for 
our products.

Polymer
 Chemicals
Polymer Chemicals is a 
leading supplier of water-
based polymers to the surface 
coatings, paper, adhesives 
and textile industries. We have 
two groups of companies, 
Synthomer and Revertex, and 
operate 13 factories across 
Europe, the Pacific Rim, the 
Middle East and South Africa. 
Our operations benefit from 
knowledge-sharing around 
the Group, particularly in the 
areas of best practice and 
new developments in  
products and technology. 
Dispersions
Product development 
Understanding our customers’ needs 
and how our products can add value 
is core to the product development 
process in our research, development 
and application laboratories around  
the world.
Multi-site manufacture 
Manufacturing flexibility is essential 
to meet the globalisation challenges 
faced by many of our customers. Most 
recently we expanded our vinyl acetate 
and acrylic dispersion capacity to over   
300,000 tonnes with the acquisition of 
a production facility in Vietnam (above), 
adding to our existing operations in the 
UK, Belgium, South Africa, the Middle 
East and Malaysia.
Distribution 
Regional manufacturing and global 
distribution mean on-time delivery  
for our customers wherever they are  
in the world.
End product 
The functionality delivered by our 
polymer dispersions helps define many  
of the attributes of our customers’ 
finished paints, such as gloss, sheen, 
texture and moisture resistance.

Annual report and accounts 2008 
08
The Division’s turnover (in sterling) was 
19% ahead of prior year driven by higher 
selling prices and currency movements. 
Overall volumes for the business were 
3% down on prior year, but this masks 
some good performances in a number  
of core markets. Operating profit ended 
3% ahead, whilst 2008 operating 
margins were 8%. 
Polymer Division’s expansion strategy  
in Asia continued in 2008 with further 
investments in both Latex and 
Dispersions. Within our Nitrile Latex 
business, the successful commissioning 
of the Phase 3 expansion at the Kluang 
plant in Malaysia in August means that 
capacity has more than doubled over the 
last 18 months as Synthomer continues 
to keep pace with the growing demand 
for synthetic latex gloves. Our ability to 
increase capacity rapidly to meet growth 
in customer demand places the business 
in an excellent position to maintain its 
leadership in this dynamic market. The 
year also saw additional investment in 
Kluang with the installation of a new 
Nitrile pilot plant and development 
laboratory, both aimed at giving the 
business state-of-the-art facilities that  
will allow faster product and process 
development, which are essential to 
meet the changing requirements of 
our customers.
Within Dispersions our geographic 
expansion strategy saw the acquisition 
of a controlling interest in Chemtech, in 
Vietnam. The business is located near 
Ho Chi Minh City and is a major supplier 
of dispersions to the coating and 
adhesives industries in one of Asia’s  
fast-developing economies. 
During the latter part of the year,  
a number of restructuring activities  
were announced in the UK. These 
changes were required to combat the 
lower levels of activity the business has 
experienced in this market. This is an 
unfortunate situation but it is critical that 
the Polymer Division continues to 
balance its manufacturing assets to  
meet anticipated market demand.
S y nthe tic 	 L at e x 	
The latex market globally saw a number 
of changes during the year with the 
exit of a leading competitor (DRLC) 
from the nitrile dipping market and the 
announcement of mothballing of three 
competitive latex plants in the UK. In 
SBR latex, although the market tightened 
during the year as the economy slowed, 
our speciality volumes ended slightly up 
on 2007, with the only reduction being 
seen in the carpet market. 
In nitrile latex the exit of DRLC created 
a number of opportunities which lifted 
volumes by 12% in Malaysia, setting 
a new record. At the same time, the 
business had to contend with rapidly 
rising butadiene prices and, of more 
concern, a lack of the monomer’s 
availability, particularly in Asia. However, 
the final quarter of the year saw an 
equally rapid decline in prices hitting 
short-term demand as customers 
emptied their supply chains to try and 
take advantage of lower monomer 
input costs. 
D is p e r s io n s
The dispersion market produced a 
variable set of results in 2008 although 
overall volume was marginally up on 
2007. Positive progress was made in a 
number of European Technical grades 
where volumes more than doubled in 
2008, and in our Middle East business 
where volume grew by 8%. However, 
we also experienced a decline in the UK 
where volumes were 13% down as a 
result of much slower customer demand 
predominantly due to the sluggish 
housing market.
S p e cia l itie s
Polyvinyl Alcohol
We continued to maintain our leadership 
position in the supply of low hydrolysis 
polyvinyl alcohol to the PVC industry. 
A very strong start to the year was 
followed by a much slower final quarter 
as PVC manufacturers started to idle 
capacity. Overall, volume for the primary 
and secondary alcotex stabilisers were 
marginally ahead of 2007, and margins 
were maintained in a difficult and 
competitive environment. The business 
continued to experience significant rises 
in operating costs as a result of higher 
energy tariffs and maintenance costs; 
however, these were offset by a better 
mix of products and some benefits from 
currency. During the year a number 
of investments were made to improve 
manufacturing performance and these 
should begin to deliver benefits in 2009.

Chief Executive’s report continued Nitrile
PIlot plant – Kluang 
Improving time to market has been a 
particular focus in our Nitrile business, 
and investment in a new NBR pilot plant 
in Kluang has significantly increased 
the speed of new product and process 
development to meet the changing 
requirements of our customers.
New labs – Kluang 
Product innovation is critical to sustained 
leadership in our markets and, as part 
of our ongoing improvement to our 
innovation processes, investments 
have been made in a new Nitrile 
R&D laboratory, located close to 
our customers to enable increased 
responsiveness by our development 
team in delivering new products.
Kluang site – Polymer 
T o support our customers’ growing 
demand for dipping latex a third phase 
of expansion was commissioned at 
Synthomer in Malaysia in 2008. This 
latest investment in Kluang means we 
have more than doubled our Nitrile  
latex capacity at this plant in the last  
18 months.

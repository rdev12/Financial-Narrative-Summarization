Chief Executive’s report
William Higgs
Chief Executive
At the beginning of 2013 we were 
looking forward to another full year of 
production from the Guendalina Field. 
Sadly this was not to be. With 
production being shut-in first at GUE 
2SS in March and then GUE 3SS in 
August our annual production fell over 
40% short of our 2013 expectations. The 
Group delivered total sales revenue of 
€8.4 million and had a cash and cash 
equivalents position of €12.4 million at  
31 December 2013.
We were pleased to note that the GUE 
3SS re-started production after the 
operator (ENI) initiated remedial 
operations on 24 December 2013. 
These operations were hampered  
by difficult weather conditions in  
the Adriatic. The intervention  
was completed successfully on  
11 January 2014 and the well returned 
to low-rate production. The well is  
now on stable production of 
approximately 5,500 scm per day net 
to MOG. In addition, the updated 
analysis of the reservoir by ERCE has 
confirmed our view that the reservoir  
is more substantial and in a better 
condition than we had assumed for 
the 2013 Interim Results statement. 
Building  
a resources 
factory
‘2013 was a tough year 
for the Company. It is 
good that 2014 will see 
us drilling wells and 
shooting seismic for the 
first time since 201 1 – 
these are the activities 
that will progress our 
portfolio’
Using this latest analysis we are able to 
reverse €1.2 million of the €1.8 million 
impairment of the Guendalina Field 
reported in September 2013.
Our critical commercial objective for 
2013 was to seek the approval of the 
Environmental Impact Assessment 
(‘EIA’) for our Ombrina Mare Field. The 
year started well with the EIA 
Commission, charged by the Ministry 
of Environment and of Protection of 
Land and Sea (‘MEPLS’) to rule on the 
Ombrina Mare oil and gas field 
development EIA, ruling positively in 
favour of MOG’s submission. The 
resulting EIA Decree was presented to 
the MEPLS for signature in February 
2013, where it has remained unsigned, 
despite continued lobbying from the 
Company with all key stakeholders, 
ever since. Once the EIA Decree is 
countersigned by the MEPLS, and by 
the Minister of Heritage and Cultural 
Activities, MOG will be able to seek 
award of the d30 BC MD Ombrina 
Mare Production Concession from the 
Ministry of Economic Development 
(‘MED’). The MED granted technical 
approval of the Field Development 
Plan for Ombrina Mare in June 2009. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 11
Company overview Business review Governance Financial statements
In 2013 we acquired a 40% working 
interest in the Exploration Study 
Agreement for offshore Malta Area 3 
Blocks 1, 2, and 3. We believe that this 
region is a complementary asset to 
offshore Malta Area 4, as it lies on the 
margin of a proven hydrocarbon 
province. We have also made good 
progress in preparing for our 
upcoming drilling activities offshore 
Malta in Area 4. All of the necessary 
logistics and contracts are in place 
and we are now awaiting arrival of the 
Noble rig ‘Paul Romano’, which is 
finalising refurbishments in Malta. Post 
the reporting period we received an 
extension of six months to the first 
exploration period to enable sufficient 
time to complete the drilling activities.
The Company has a broad asset base 
across the exploration, development 
and production phases of the 
business. These assets have significant 
upside potential and we are looking 
ahead to de-risk and mature these 
assets over the coming years, while 
also looking for valuable opportunities 
for asset acquisition.
Gas Production and Prices
All gas production of the Group is 
currently from onshore and offshore Italy.
In 2013, total gas production was 0.97 
Bcf (27.6 MMscm), which represented a 
42% reduction relative to the prior year 
(2012: 1.69 Bcf). This was largely due to 
the reduction in gas production at the 
Guendalina Gas Field caused by the 
shut-in of wells GUE 2SS and GUE 3SS.
During 2012, the Brent oil price has 
fluctuated around $100-110/bbl, while 
the Euro versus US Dollar exchange rate 
has experienced significant volatility 
which has influenced gas prices. The 
average gas sales price achieved  
by the Group during the period was 
€0.30/scm (USD 11.2/Mcf).
The Company’s forecasts for future gas 
prices indicate continued downward 
pressure in 2014 and 2015 and the 
Italian gas price is expected to remain 
between 28.1 and 29.3 Euro cents per 
scm which is below the long run 
average gas price, due to the excess 
of gas supply relative to gas demand 
in the Italian market.
What Happened at Guendalina?
The problems encountered at the 
Guendalina Field in 2013 are still under 
investigation, but appear to have their 
origins in the spring of 2012 when the 
operating conditions of the two wells 
GUE 2SS and GUE 3SS changed in late 
May 2012.
In the case of GUE 2SS, both the 
production rate and the flowing 
wellhead pressure increased, which  
at the time was (correctly) interpreted 
as a cleaning up of the well and the 
unexpected addition of incremental 
production from sand intervals not 
originally connected to the well. In 
September 2012, after a short well 
shut-in, GUE 2SS had a sudden 
deterioration in gas rate as well  
as wellhead tubing pressure. 
Unfortunately on 5 March 2013, after 
several months of decline, GUE 2SS was 
taken offline to determine the cause of 
an influx of water that resulted in the 
well ceasing production. The probable 
cause of the well shut-in is the 
premature water breakthrough from 
the bottom aquifer associated with the 
additional sand intervals that started 
contributing in May 2012. This well is 
currently shut-in and will remain shut-in 
for the foreseeable future. However, the 
gas level completed for production at 
GUE 2SS is being produced from well 
GUE 3LS, which is in an up dip location.
In the case of GUE 3SS, the production 
rate increased and the flowing well 
head pressure decreased. Once 
again, the characteristics of the well 
indicate cleaning up of the completion 
and, in this case, an increase in the 
drawdown of the reservoir. In July and 
August 2013 the production rate on 
GUE 3SS started to decline more rapidly 
and the well was taken offline on  
30 August 2013 due to low pressure at 
the manifold. Subsequent analysis 
indicated that the reservoir was in 
good condition and at a higher static 
pressure than predicted. With these 
new data it was possible to 
demonstrate that the well performance 
had been progressively deteriorating 
since the late May 2012 event and that 
the observed increased ‘skin’ to the 
well was probably the consequence of 
the migration of fine grained material 
towards the wellbore, which 
progressively reduced productivity. This 
was unknowable during the period of 
time that the well was on production. 
With these new data the operator (ENI) 
designed and executed a remedial 
treatment of the well to remove the 
fines. The well was brought back onto 
low-rate production on 11 January 
2014. The well continues to clean up 
and is currently achieving stable 
production of approximately 5,500 scm 
per day net to the Company.
Well GUE 3LS has maintained its 
operating conditions throughout 2012 
and 2013. GUE 3LS has been performing 
in line with expectations and is currently 
producing about 31,000 scm per day 
net to the Company.
The knock-on effects of the damage  
to these two wells cannot be 
understated. We quickly went from a 
cash flow positive to cash flow negative 
business when including all operating 
and capital costs. This has placed 
downward pressure on the share price 
and created sufficient uncertainty in 
our future cash flows that it has been 
very difficult to undertake any 
accretive transactions.
Oil & Gas Reserves and Resources
In 2013 the Company selected ERCE  
to undertake an audit of the Group’s 
reserves and resources. This analysis, 
which has been detailed and robust, 
has resulted in some significant 
movement and reductions on our 
Reserves and Resources ledger. The 
changes year-on-year are highlighted 
below. Importantly, we can now be 
confident in the assessment and 
therefore value of our Reserves and 
Resources.
As at 31 December 2013, the Company 
recorded 2P reserves of 5.3 Bcf (net) of 
gas (1.0 MMboe) and 2,376 boe of 
condensate. Best estimate contingent 
resources were 26 MMbbls oil (net) 
and 32.4 Bcf (net) of gas. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 12

Asset Overview
Exploration, Development and 
Production
Italy – Offshore Northern Adriatic
The Company’s efforts during the 
period under review were mostly 
focused on understanding the 
production challenges at the 
Guendalina gas field offshore Italy  
in the northern Adriatic.
Other North Adriatic Gas Discoveries 
(MOG WI 15%, ENI WI 85% and 
Operator)
The Guendalina project is located in 
one of the most important gas 
exploration and production areas in 
Italy and is situated 70km south of four 
other discovered, but still 
undeveloped, offshore gas fields in 
which the Group has a 15% interest.
These four gas discoveries amount to 
between 10 to 50 Bcf net contingent 
gas resources to the Group and 
represent an important growth 
opportunity for the Company. Their 
reclassification from 2C (Contingent 
Resources) to 2P reserves is expected 
to take place following authorisation of 
the development plans for the fields.
The tables set out on pages 12 and 13 
summarise the evolution of the 
Group’s hydrocarbon Reserves and 
Resources since 2006 and include 
the latest update, as at 31 December 
2013.
 > 2P Oil Reserves were reduced with 
the movement of the Ombrina 
Mare Field into the Contingent 
Resources Category
 > The Company’s 2P RRR was -129%, 
which was caused by a negative 
revision of Reserves
 > The Company’s 2P Reserves to 
Production (‘R/P’) ratio for gas has 
dropped to 5.5
 > Prospective Resources for the 
Monte Grosso prospect have been 
certified as 9.8 MMbbls (1E), 29.9 
MMbbls (2E) and 85.3 MMbbls (3E) 
with a mean of 41.5 MMbbls
 > The Company is committed to 
de-risk and mature resources, to 
progressively replace reserves, 
maintaining the 2P RRR at around 
100% and targeting an R/P ratio of 
approximately 9
Development activity for these fields 
was frozen from 2001, initially pending 
the resolution of environmental 
concerns about subsidence caused 
by developing the offshore region.  
The Italian Government indicated in 
2009 that it is in favour of a positive 
resolution of these issues in this area of 
the Northern Adriatic. As a portion of 
the Company’s AC19 PI concession lies 
within 12 miles of nature reserves it was 
impacted by the 2010 offshore 
restrictions introduced by the Italian 
Government for the offshore E&P 
activities. On 7 August 2012 the Italian 
Parliament issued the Law 134/2012 
containing Article 35, which relates to 
offshore exploration and production 
activities. The Article states that the 
restrictions introduced under Decree 
DLGS 128/2010 would no longer be 
applicable for the pre-existing offshore 
E&P activities such as concession AC19 
PI. The Company can now work with 
ENI to increase the priority of the 
development of the Northern Adriatic 
discoveries within AC19 PI.

Company overview Business review Governance Financial statements
Italy – Onshore Foredeep Gas
In Italy, the Company has focused its 
footprint of onshore production and 
exploration gas assets that target gas 
traps in the Pliocene aged sand 
deposits of the Apennines Foredeep 
with the completion of the sale  
of 13 non-core assets to Canoel 
International Energy Limited. In our 
remaining E&P acreage the existing 
production is not the only value. In fact, 
several interesting development and 
exploration projects are also present, 
mainly within existing production 
concessions that have the potential to 
unlock approximately 26 to 64 Bcf net 
unrisked prospective resources to the 
Group and achieve new near to 
mid-term gas production.
In December 2012, we received the 
award of the Aglavizza Production 
Concession onshore central Italy 
where we have a 100% interest in the 
7km
2
 concession that includes the 
Civita 1 discovery with estimated 
proved and probable reserves close  
to 1 Bcf. Post the award, we safely 
conducted a production test of Civita 
1 that confirmed excellent permeability 
and no near-well bore formation 
damage. In Q3 2013 the Board made 
the final investment decision for the 
Aglavizza development. First gas is 
expected in Q3 2015 and over the 
two-year development cycle the 
Company will invest €2.8 million.  
The asset is expected to start with 
production rates of 18,000 to  
20,000 scm per day.
Italy – Ombrina Mare
Oil & Gas Discovery (MOG WI 100%)
The Ombrina Mare discovery is an 
important asset for the Company that 
represents an important future growth 
opportunity.
Following the successful drilling of two 
exploration/appraisal wells in 2008, the 
completion of a well as an oil producer 
and the set-up of a tripod platform in 
preparation for the development 
phase, the Company applied for a 
production Concession (d 30 B.C-MD) 
in December 2008. In the reporting 
period the Company worked with ERCE 
to complete a revised independent 
certification of Ombrina Mare on the 
expectation that we would be soon 
moving forwards with the development. 
Because of the continued delay to the 
award of the EIA for the project and the 
need for further appraisal drilling to fully 
assess the potential of the asset, ERCE 
certified Ombrina Mare oil and gas into 
the Contingent Resources category 
with 9.8 MMboe oil and 4.03 Bcf gas 
(1C), 25.1 MMboe oil and 8.04 Bcf gas 
(2C), and 62.8 MMboe oil and 17 .2 Bcf 
gas (3C). We plan on drilling a pilot 
development well as soon as 
logistically and safely possible post the 
award of the production concession. 
The goals of the pilot appraisal well 
would be:
 > To assess the potential for a 
hydrodynamic or tilted oil-water 
contact
 > To assess net reservoir distribution  
to the north away from the crest  
of the structure
 > To test the hydrodynamic 
performance of the reservoir
 > To test the potential of the 
Cretaceous interval to contribute to 
the productivity
The year started well with the EIA 
Commission, charged by the MEPLS to 
rule on the Ombrina Mare oil and gas 
field development EIA, ruling positively 
in favour of MOG’s submission. The 
resulting EIA Decree was presented to 
the MEPLS for signature in February 
2013, where it has remained unsigned 
ever since. Significant effort and 
resources have been directed at 
creating the correct environment for 
the Italian authorities to make a 
positive decision. We have engaged 
with the local communities onshore 
from the proposed development 
location including the opening of a 
new office in the important port town 
of Ortona.

Malta – Offshore Area 4
The Group holds a 25% working interest 
in offshore Malta Area 4, which 
comprises 5,700km
2
 of deep water 
acreage north of the internationally 
recognised border between Malta  
and Libya.
During the period:
 > We completed the sale of a 75% 
interest in offshore Malta Area 4  
to Genel for:
 > US$10 million cash payment 
(received in February 2013);
 > 100% carry on the first exploration 
well, and a 100% carry on the 
second exploration well up to 
US$30 million gross expenditure;
 > At MOG’s option, should the costs 
of the second well exceed US$30 
million, Genel will provide a 
financing arrangement to fund 
MOG’s 25% share of any 
additional expenditure, at an 
interest rate equivalent to 3 
Month LIBOR plus 400 bps.
 > We completed the logistics, 
contract awards and procurement 
required to support the drilling of the 
first exploration well, which is 
expected to spud in Q1 2014.
The area is frontier exploration where 
no drilling activity has occurred and  
it is one of the rare areas that still 
remains to be explored in the 
Mediterranean basin. The transaction 
with Genel means that a minimum of 
two exploration wells are now fully 
funded.
Post period the Company received an 
extension of the first exploration period 
by six months until 17 July 2014 to 
enable completion of the drilling 
activity. In addition, the Company 
modified the terms of its sale to Genel 
such that the two parties are now in a 
Joint Venture partnership, with a Joint 
Operating Agreement.
We have taken all necessary steps, 
including legal action, to protect 
shareholders’ interests. We will 
continue our active dialogue with the 
Italian Government, with a view to 
securing approval of the EIA for 
Ombrina Mare and the award  
of the associated Production 
Concession. Once the EIA Decree is 
countersigned by the MEPLS and the 
Minister of Heritage and Cultural 
Activities, MOG will be able to seek 
the award of the d30 BC MD Ombrina 
Mare Production Concession from 
the MED. The MED has already 
granted technical approval of the 
Field Development Plan for Ombrina 
Mare in June 2009.
Wildcat Exploration
Italy – Southern Apennines
In the Southern Apennines, the Group 
operates the Monte Grosso project, 
holding a 22.89% interest. The project 
is a high quality near field exploration 
opportunity close to one of the 
largest onshore oil producing areas 
in western Europe. The Monte Grosso 
exploration project presently remains 
on hold, pending resolution of 
residual permitting issues, which the 
Group presently believes should be 
positively resolved and allow a 
project start-up in late 2015 (subject 
to rig availability). The Monte Grosso 2 
well is targeting 181 MMbbls of 
unrisked mean Prospective Resources 
(41.5 MMbbls net to the Group) at a 
depth of 6,800m. Permitting and 
existing well site maintenance works 
were the main activities conducted 
during the period.
Offshore Malta Area 4 is a high risk, but 
potentially a high reward, geological 
environment where nine prospects 
and leads have been certified by ERCE 
and RPS with a total of 381 million bbls 
of unrisked prospective oil resources 
net to MOG.
Malta – Offshore Area 3
In June 2013 MOG reached agreement 
with Transunion Petroleum Ltd 
(‘Transunion’) and Nautical Petroleum 
Ltd, a subsidiary of Cairn Energy PLC 
(‘Cairn’), to join Cairn in the 
exploration of offshore Malta Area 3 
– Blocks 1, 2 and 3 (‘Area 3’).
In December 2012 Cairn entered into  
a three-year Exploration Study 
Agreement (‘SA’) with the Government 
of Malta for offshore Area 3, which is 
located in the Sicily Channel covering 
an area of approximately 6,000km
2
 
and containing a number of 
prospective leads. The ESA covers an 
initial two-year period with geological 
studies, the reprocessing of existing 2D 
seismic data, the acquisition of new 2D 
seismic data and limited capital works. 
The agreement provides the right to 
negotiate a production sharing 
contract and it can be extended to a 
third year to acquire 3D seismic. The 
assignment of an interest in the ESA  
to Melita Exploration Company Ltd,  
a wholly owned subsidiary of the 
Company, was approved by the 
Government of Malta in July 2013.
The joint venture has approved the 
acquisition of approximately 1,500km 
broadband 2D seismic in H1 2014  
and the operator is finalising the 
preparation of the seismic campaign.
France – St Laurent
The St Laurent permit is located in 
southern France in a known gas and 
oil prone province. The Company has 
an 11% WI in this asset. There has been 
little activity on the permit in 2013. The 
joint venture partners are seeking an 
extension to the exploration period 
from the French authorities. Mediterranean Oil & Gas Plc / Annual Report & Accounts 2013 15

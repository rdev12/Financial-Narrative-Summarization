w is a masterbatch system which, when 
included at the manufacturing stage, turns 
ordinary plastic at the end of its useful life 
into a material with a different molecular 
structure. It is then no longer a plastic and 
has become a material which is inherently 
biodegradable in the open environment in 
the same way as a leaf.

OVERVIEW
d
2
p is a family of masterbatches which offer 
extra protection to plastic products from 
bacteria, insects, fungi, algae, odour, fouling, 
and fire.
Antibacterial
Fights healthcare and food industry 
infections. Tested against dangerous 
organisms including MRSA, E-coli, Listeria, 
Salmonella, Pseudomonas and Aspergillus 
Niger. 
Natural
Antibacterial suitable for use in food and 
non-food applications. In compliance with 
FDA Food and Drug Administration,  
USA and EFSA (European Food Safety 
Authority) requirements.
Antimicrobial
The primary purpose is to prevent bacterial 
and fungal contamination whilst preserving 
the aesthetic and functional properties of  
the plastic article.
Odour adsorber
Inorganic masterbatches and additives 
designed to inhibit the development of 
odours in plastic products and to prevent 
spoilage of fruit and vegetables.
Insecticide technology
Insecticidal plastic masterbatches used to 
control pests. Typically used in mosquito 
nets, agriculture, horticulture, forestry and 
home applications.
Flame retardant 
Flame retardants decrease the ignitability  
of materials and inhibit the combustion 
process – limiting the amount of heat 
released.
Pest control
Rodents can cause dangerous damage to 
plastic products such as cable insulation, 
warehouse pallets, non-food packaging  
and boxes etc. Symphony has developed 
additive masterbatches with products that 
repel these pests.
Anti-fouling
Anti-fouling paint is a specialised coating 
applied to the hull of a ship or boat to reduce 
the growth of aquatic organisms.

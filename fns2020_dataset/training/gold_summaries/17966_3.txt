 04 Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015
Strategic report | Chairman’s statement
Chairman’s statement
The strength and resilience of our business model combined 
with the execution of our consistent and proven strategy has 
once again delivered further growth.
Results
Although challenging macroeconomic 
conditions persisted in many of the countries 
in which we operate, particularly in Latin 
America and Australasia, and difficult market 
conditions continued to affect some of the 
sectors we serve, I am pleased to report 
another good set of results. Overall currency 
translation movements had a small positive 
impact on the Group’s revenue but reduced 
the growth rates for profits and earnings  
at actual exchange rates by between 1%  
and 2%. 
Group revenue increased to £6,489.7 million 
(2014: £6,156.5 million) and adjusted 
operating profit before intangible 
amortisation and acquisition related costs 
was £455.0 million (2014: £429.8 million). 
Adjusted earnings per share were 91.0p 
(2014: 86.2p).
At constant exchange rates revenue 
increased by 5% and adjusted operating 
profit rose by 7%. The Group operating 
margin improved from 6.9% to 7.0% at 
constant exchange rates with adjusted 
earnings per share up 7% on the  
same basis. 
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final  
dividend of 26.25p. This brings the total 
dividend for the year to 38.0p, up 7% 
compared to 2014. Shareholders will  
again have the opportunity to participate  
in our dividend reinvestment plan.
Strategy
We have continued to pursue our long-
established and successful strategy of 
developing the business through organic 
growth, consolidating our markets through 
focused acquisitions and continuously 
improving the efficiency of our operations. 
We seek to achieve organic growth by 
applying our resources and expertise to 
enable customers to reduce or eliminate the 
hidden costs of sourcing and distributing a 
broad range of goods not for resale. As a 
result they are able to focus on their core 
business and run their operations more  
cost-effectively by achieving purchasing 
efficiencies and savings, while at the same 
time freeing up working capital, improving 
their distribution capabilities, reducing 
carbon emissions and simplifying their 
internal administration. 
Acquisition activity continued at a record 
pace throughout 2015. We acquired 22 
businesses during the year with a total 
committed spend of £327 million, thereby 
adding annualised revenue of £324 million.  
These figures exclude Tillman which we 
agreed to acquire in December 2014 and 
completed at the beginning of January  
2015. The acquisitions made in 2015 have 
helped to strengthen our position in many  
of the markets that we serve and have  
also taken us into two new countries,  
Turkey and Austria. We now have  
operations in 29 countries.
Investment
Both organic growth and acquisitions require 
investment in the business to expand and 
enhance its asset base. During the year we 
have continued to extend and improve our 
warehouses and open new ones, both as a 
result of acquisitions and by consolidating 
our existing warehouse footprint. Systems 
are an important part of our ability to serve 
our customers in the most efficient and 
appropriate manner. By continuously 
upgrading our IT systems we are able to 
increase the functionality of our operations, 
thereby enhancing our customer offering. 
Together this investment enables us to  
retain a competitive advantage and thereby 
maintain our leading position in the 
marketplace.
Corporate responsibility
We continue to refine our sustainable 
business processes and operations to ensure 
improvements in this area. However, we also 
strive to assist both our customers and 
suppliers to improve the sustainability of 
their businesses. The nature of our business 
proposition, which allows our customers to 
consolidate both their purchasing 
requirements and product deliveries, is 
environmentally friendly and, in addition, we 
offer a full range of environmentally friendly 
products. During 2015, we once again  Bunzl plc Annual Report 2015 05

contacted our key suppliers to encourage 
them to adopt corporate responsibility 
policies similar to ours. Our quality 
assurance/quality control team based in 
Shanghai continues to refine our supplier 
audit process, undertaking audits of our  
key Asian suppliers to assist them in  
meeting our required standards. Integrity  
is imperative in running our business and 
building appropriate relationships and we 
have recently refreshed our whistle blowing 
programme and renewed the corporate 
responsibility training for all relevant 
employees.
Employees
Bunzl’s decentralised organisation structure 
encourages fast decision making at the local 
level. This allows us to understand our 
customers’ needs and provide great service. 
Many new people have joined Bunzl through 
acquisitions during the past year and this 
provides us with a stream of new ideas to 
improve our business and strengthens our 
talent pipeline. As a service oriented 
company we continue to rely on the quality 
and efficiency of our employees across the 
world. We very much appreciate their hard 
work and loyalty which are key to the ongoing 
growth and success of Bunzl.

Board
As reported in the 2014 Annual Report, Peter 
Johnson, who had served as a non-executive 
director since 2006 and was both Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee and senior 
independent director, retired from the Board 
in April 2015. David Sleath, who was 
appointed as a non-executive director in 
September 2007 and is Chairman of the  
Audit Committee, assumed the role of senior 
independent director and Vanda Murray, who 
joined the Board as a non-executive director 
in February 2015, succeeded Peter as 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
As reported on 14 January 2016, after more 
than 10 years in the role, Michael Roney has 
decided to retire as Chief Executive of the 
Company. He will stand down from his 
position and the Board following the 
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to 
be held on 20 April 2016. I would like to thank 
Mike for his outstanding contribution to 
Bunzl. Under his careful stewardship the 
Group has gone from strength to strength 
and grown significantly with sustained 
increases in the Company’s earnings, 
dividends and share price. Mike will leave  
the Board with our very best wishes and  
our sincere thanks and appreciation for 
everything he has achieved. 
Mike will be succeeded by Frank van Zanten 
who is currently the Managing Director of  
the Continental Europe business area.  
Frank joined the Board at the beginning  
of February and will assume his new role 
upon Mike’s retirement. He has extensive 
knowledge and experience of our business 
gained over many years and has a successful 
track record of implementing the Company’s 
strategy to develop and expand the Group. 
His appointment will provide continuity for 
the business as well as its customers and 
employees going forward.

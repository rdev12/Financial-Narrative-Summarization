APR Energy at a glance
Overview
APR Energy is a global 
leader in rapidly delivered 
large-scale power 
solutions and, following 
our acquisition of the GE 
Power Rental Business 
and our GE strategic 
alliance, we are the 
world’s leading provider 
of fast-track mobile 
turbine power. 
Serving both developed and developing markets, APR Energy sells electricity and generation 
capacity to utilities, countries, and industries that have critical power deficits or that require 
dedicated, distributed, or seasonal generation solutions. 
Fast-track power
Global reach
APR Energy delivers power fast, 
when and where it is needed. We 
combine highly mobile technology with 
proprietary modular plant design and 
advanced engineering, logistics, and 
installation capabilities to deploy, install, 
and commission a large-scale power 
plant within days or weeks.
With a presence in over 25 countries, 
a network of regional hubs and 
commercial offices, a fleet capacity 
exceeding two gigawatts (GW), and 
attendant supplier relationships in all our 
key markets, APR Energy stands ready 
to respond quickly to urgent electricity 
needs wherever they may be around 
the globe. 
APR Energy installs, operates, 
and maintains its own plants and 
equipment, including site preparation 
and integration with surrounding 
infrastructure. Customers, therefore, do 
not worry about project management, 
plant operations, or upfront funding 
or financing, typically paying only for 
electricity generation and capacity.
APR Energy’s industry-leading logistical, 
project management, and engineering 
expertise enables us to mobilise 
large-scale power plants quickly 
and efficiently. Our fast-track, highly 
developed processes integrate across 
all logistics, planning, engineering, 
installation, legal, and commercial 
teams to ensure seamless and rapid 
execution.

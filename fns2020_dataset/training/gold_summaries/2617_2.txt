Strategic Report – Performance
Retail 
70% of revenue (2013: 71%); with 215 mainline stores, 
227 concessions within department stores, digital 
commerce and 55 outlets.
 ·
Retail sales up 15% underlying and at reported FX
 ·
Comparable sales up 12% (H1: 13%; H2: 12%)
 ·
New space contributed the balance of growth (3%)
 ·
Digital performed strongly
With consumer behaviour rapidly evolving, Burberry 
focused on improving the customer experience both offline 
and online, driving 12% comparable sales growth. In-store, 
footfall remained weak but was offset by improved 
conversion, reflecting investment particularly in customer 
service. Online, both traffic and conversion grew, with the 
integration of digital into the regional infrastructure driving 
the growth of sales via iPads in-store and collect-in-store.
Mainline retail benefited from balanced growth in average 
selling prices and volume, the latter reflecting the success 
of product categories such as small leather goods, scarves, 
mens accessories and Beauty, which were featured in 
marketing campaigns around festive periods globally. 
Outerwear and large leather goods again delivered half 
of the growth, demonstrating the strength of the brand 
in these core categories. Mens was the fastest growing 
category, where Burberry is under-penetrated given its 
heritage. Investment in design, merchandising and key 
looks, coupled with product elevation and the launch 
of travel tailoring drove growth. 
Asia Pacific
With retail accounting for about 85% of revenue in the 
region, comparable sales growth in Asia Pacific was 
double-digit percentage throughout the year, led by 
Greater China, especially Hong Kong, following significant 
investment in real estate made in this flagship market. 
Mainland China delivered 11% comparable sales growth, 
management actions drove an improvement in Korea, 
while the small retail operation in Japan selling the global 
collection delivered strong revenue growth.
A net six stores and concessions were opened during the 
year, evolving the store portfolio in China, Korea and Hong 
Kong in particular.
Europe, Middle East, India and Africa (EMEIA)
In the EMEIA region, which was formed on 1 April 2013 
from the integration of Burberry operations in Europe and 
Rest of World, retail accounted for about 65% of revenue. 
Comparable sales growth was high single-digit percentage 
for the year, slowing slightly in the second half in major 
markets. For the year, performance was robust in the UK, 
France and Spain, but weaker in Italy and the United Arab 
Emirates. With about 40% of mainline transactions in 
EMEIA to travelling luxury customers, investment in 
marketing and customer service was concentrated in 
flagship markets.
A net four stores and concessions were added during 
the year (15 openings, 11 closures) reflecting relocations 
in markets including Germany and Saudi Arabia, two 
more stores in India (bringing the total to nine) and the 
first Burberry Beauty Box in Covent Garden, London.
Americas
About 60% of Americas revenue came from retail, with high 
single-digit comparable sales growth during the year. In the 
United States, domestic customers still account for about 
90% of transactions, with digital penetration more than 
twice the group average. 
The number of mainline stores in the Americas was 
unchanged year-on-year at 78, with three closures of small 
stores in the United States balanced by one additional store 
in Brazil (bringing the total to eight) and two openings in 
Mexico (bringing the total to four).

Strategic Report – Performance
Wholesale 
27% of revenue (2013: 24%); generated from sales of 
apparel and accessories to department stores, multi-brand 
specialty accounts, franchise stores and Travel Retail; as 
well as Beauty to around 100 distributors worldwide.
 ·
Excluding Beauty, wholesale revenue up 2% underlying

 ·
Beauty wholesale revenue of £144m in first year of direct 
operation, in line with guidance
 ·
Wholesale revenue including Beauty up 32% underlying 
(up 33% at reported FX)
The first half of the year saw wholesale revenue, excluding 
Beauty, down 7% underlying. This reflected more 
conservative planning globally by wholesale customers 
for A/W13 and Burberry’s continued strategic rationalisation 
of wholesale accounts (particularly in Europe) and entry 
price products (particularly in North America). With strong 
brand momentum and some rephasing of deliveries into 
the fourth quarter of FY 2014 from the current first quarter, 
underlying wholesale revenue in the second half increased by 
11%, with Americas and Travel Retail showing double-digit 
growth and EMEIA up mid single-digit. 
The regional comments below all exclude Beauty.
Asia Pacific
Asia Pacific, which is the smallest wholesale region in the 
Group, is predominantly Travel Retail, with outperformance 
in Hong Kong and Korea during the year. One store and 
two concessions previously operated by a franchisee 
were acquired in Thailand, in line with Burberry’s strategy 
of taking greater control in high potential markets.
Europe, Middle East, India and Africa 
EMEIA is the Group’s largest wholesale region – at around 
45% of wholesale revenue. Further account rationalisation 
held back growth in Europe, while relationships with key 
strategic accounts were strengthened. Emerging markets 
revenue was subdued, reflecting softer consumer demand 
in larger markets, including Turkey.
Americas
Above average growth was delivered in the United States 
where Burberry continued to elevate its wholesale presence, 
both online and by opening more dedicated shop-in-shops 
in key department stores, while rationalising inappropriate 
doors and product ranges. Nine Holt Renfrew locations in 
Canada were converted from wholesale to retail concessions 
in the last quarter of the year. 
Beauty
Following the move to direct operation on 1 April 2013, 
Beauty wholesale revenue was £144m. In the first half, 
sales of established fragrances were impacted by many 
distributors being fully stocked by the previous licensee 
and by execution and supply chain issues during the 
complex transitional period. 
This revenue shortfall was offset by bringing forward 
the launch of the Brit Rhythm for Women fragrance into 
February 2014, building on the success of Brit Rhythm 
for Men in September 2013. To support the digitally-led 
launch, Burberry introduced Brit Rhythm inspired 
apparel, leveraging the halo of the campaign across 
all product divisions. 
Licensing 
3% of revenue (2013: 5%); of which about 80% is from 
Japan (split roughly 85% apparel and 15% from various 
accessories licences), with the balance from global product 
licences (eyewear and watches) and European wholesale 
childrenswear.
 ·
Licensing revenue up 2% underlying (down 4% at 
reported FX) excluding £27m from fragrance in FY 2013
 ·
In line with full year guidance
 ·
Licensing revenue including fragrance down 23% 
underlying (down 28% at reported FX)
Royalty income from Japan was £62m, unchanged  
year-on-year at constant exchange rates. Income from 
the apparel licence increased slightly, reflecting higher 
minimum payments, offset by the planned downsizing 
of the remaining accessories licences in Japan.
Eyewear and watches together delivered double-digit 
percentage growth. Product launches included the Spark 
and Trench eyewear collections, while The Britain watch 
remained the focus for elevating the collection to a more 
luxury positioning. 57

Adjusted operating profit increased by 8% to £460.3m, including a £2.6m adverse FX impact. Adjusted operating margin 
fell to 19.8%, reflecting the channel mix shift as Beauty moved from high margin licensing to direct operation.

 Adjusted operating margin 17.5% 17.8%
On 19% revenue growth, retail/wholesale adjusted 
operating profit increased by 17% to £393.5m, including 
an FX benefit of £2.1m. The adjusted operating margin 
was 17.5%, compared to 17.8% last year (or 17.1% 
excluding the benefit of a lower performance-related 
pay charge in FY 2013). 
On a revenue base of £144.1m, Beauty wholesale in its 
first year of direct operation contributed incremental retail/
wholesale profit of £10.8m, in line with revised guidance. 
Gross margin was impacted by short-term supply chain 
issues and operating expenses were higher than planned, 
reflecting marketing investment behind the earlier launch 
of the Brit Rhythm for Women fragrance. With the transition 
year complete and Beauty now operating as the fifth 
product division, Beauty incremental retail/wholesale 
profit will not be reported separately going forward.
Excluding Beauty, the adjusted operating margin moved 
from 17.8% in FY 2013 to 18.2% in FY 2014. The gross 
margin increased by around 40 basis points, reflecting 
small gains from net price increases and the channel shift 
to retail. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue 
was flat year-on-year. About half of the increase came from 
general inflation and new space, with the balance from 
volume-related costs and increased investment in areas 
such as marketing, creative media and customer service, 
which drove the revenue growth. The performance-related 
pay charge was broadly unchanged in the full year, mainly 
as company performance did not meet internal targets.

As previously discussed, licensing revenue declined by 
23% on an underlying basis (down 28% at reported FX), 
largely reflecting the termination of the fragrance and 
beauty licence relationship. With the direct operation of 
Beauty, allocated operating expenses year-on-year were 
reduced. Operating profit of £66.8m was after a negative 
FX impact of £4.7m, largely reflecting the movement in the 
effective yen rate from £1:Yen127 in FY 2013 to £1:Yen137 
in FY 2014. 58

China put option liability finance  
(charge)/credit (1.7) 5.2
Termination of licence relationship – (82.9)
Restructuring credit – 0.6
(16.6) (77.1)
The charge of £14.9m relates to the amortisation of the 
fragrance and beauty licence intangible asset of £70.9m 
which was recognised in FY 2013. This asset will be 
amortised on a straight line basis over the period 
1 April 2013 to 31 December 2017.
The China put option liability finance charge of £1.7m 
relates to fair value movements, including the discount 
unwind, on the put option liability over the non-controlling 
interest in the acquired Chinese business. 
Non-controlling interest 
The movement in the profit attributable to the non-
controlling interest from £4.9m in FY 2013 to £9.8m in 
FY 2014 primarily reflects Burberry taking full effective 
ownership of the retail business in Japan from 29 March 
2013. This business was loss-making in FY 2013.
Taxation 
The tax rate on adjusted profit in FY 2014 was 24.7% 
(2013: 25.8%), largely reflecting the lower UK corporation 
tax rate. 
The tax charge of £112.1m (2013: £91.5m) gave an effective 
tax rate on reported profit of 25.2% (2013: 26.1%). Tax on 
exceptional items has been recognised as appropriate. 
Net cash
Net cash at 31 March 2014 was £403m, an increase of 
£106m year-on-year. Cash inflow from operations was 
£536m, a similar level to last year. Capital expenditure was 
£154m, below guidance reflecting both phasing of new 
projects and timing on payments of existing projects. Other 
major outflows were tax of £111m and dividends of £131m.
Inventory at 31 March 2014 was £420m (2013: £351m). 
Excluding Beauty (£61m), this was an 11% increase  
year-on-year at constant exchange rates, compared  
to 15% retail sales growth. 
Outlook 
Retail: In FY 2015, net new space is expected to contribute 
low to mid single-digit percentage growth to total retail 
revenue. Burberry plans to open about 20-25 mainline 
stores and close between 15-20, with openings biased to 
flagship markets and travel retail, while further evolving the 
store portfolio in China and the Middle East in particular. 
Wholesale: Excluding Beauty, Burberry expects 
wholesale revenue at constant exchange rates to be 
broadly unchanged in the six months to 30 September 2014 
(2013: £244m). Excluding rephased deliveries and ongoing 
strategic initiatives, such as conversion from wholesale to 
direct control and account rationalisation, revenue growth 
of around 5% is planned. 
For Beauty, the fifth product division, wholesale revenue 
is expected to grow by about 25% at constant exchange 
rates in FY 2015.
Retail/wholesale profit: If exchange rates* remain at current 
levels, the full impact on reported retail/wholesale profit in 
FY 2015 will be material. As an indication, rebasing FY 2014 
retail/wholesale profit for current exchange rates would 
reduce reported profit by about £40m and adjusted 
operating margin from 17.5% to around 16.3%.
Burberry increased retail/wholesale operating margin by 
about 200 basis points over the last three years. Its goal 
to further improve margin remains unchanged, although 
this may be impacted in FY 2015 by continued planned 
investment in areas such as flagship markets, customer 
service, digital and people in addition to potential 
FX headwinds. 
Licensing: For FY 2015, Burberry expects broadly 
unchanged revenue at constant exchange rates in both 
Japan and global product licences, the latter reflecting 
the rationalisation and elevation of watch distribution. 
At current exchange rates*, reported licensing revenue 
in FY 2015 will be reduced by about £10m given the 
movement in the sterling/yen rate. 
Tax rate: The tax rate on adjusted profit for FY 2015 
is currently expected to be about 23%.
* Rates as at 12 May 2014, taking into account the current hedged positions 59
Strategic Report – Performance
Capital expenditure: Spend of about £200m is planned 
in FY 2015, with about three-quarters on retail.
Dividend: It is the Board’s intention to move progressively 
over the next three years to a 50% dividend payout ratio, 
based on full year adjusted diluted EPS. 
Beauty: Looking to FY 2016 and FY 2017, Burberry is 
targeting mid-teens percentage growth from fragrance, 
built around key pillars, such as Brit, while developing both 
traditional and non-traditional distribution channels. These 
include offline in directly-operated stores and those of key 
partners; online on burberry.com and with third-party digital 
players; and in Travel Retail, where Burberry is significantly 
under-penetrated. Product development continues in 
make-up, while we continue to evaluate the Burberry 
Beauty Box concept, both as a retail format and foundation 
for beauty counters. 
Japan: With the Japan licences expiring in June 2015, 
Burberry has a significant opportunity to build a growing 
and profitable business in Japan, offering the global 
collection to the core luxury consumer in the second 
largest domestic luxury market in the world. Burberry 
currently has four stores and ten concessions in Japan 
selling the global collection, which, combined with a 
small wholesale business, generated revenue of about 
£25m and was breakeven.
Building on this base, Burberry plans to add free-standing 
stores and department store concessions, while leveraging 
owned digital capabilities and those of third parties. 
Committed store openings include Omotesando and 
Shinjuku, Tokyo, and Osaka, while planning to add about 
ten concessions a year in FY 2016 and 2017. By FY 2017, 
retail revenue of over £100m is targeted with incremental 
profit of about £25m.
To facilitate the brand transformation, Burberry has 
agreed with the apparel licensee, Sanyo Shokai, an orderly 
transition, including exiting the licensed Burberry product 
from the primary channel by September 2015. In addition, 
a new three-year licence with the same partner has been 
signed for the continued use of the Blue and Black Labels 
in Japan, which have strong appeal to younger consumers 
in the contemporary apparel market. These labels will 
have no association with the Burberry brand. 
In FY 2016, licensing income will include royalty income 
of about £18m relating to the existing licences including 
the orderly transition and exit of local licensed product; 
and about £5m from the new Blue and Black Label licence 
including the minimum payment for the first six months 
from September 2015. In FY 2017, licensing income from 
the new Blue and Black Label licence is expected to be 
around £10m including the minimum payment for six months 
and variable thereafter. The FY 2016 and FY 2017 guidance 
is all at current exchange rates (as at 12 May 2014).

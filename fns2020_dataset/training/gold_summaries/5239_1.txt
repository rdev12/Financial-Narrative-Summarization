deliver guaranteed return on investment

Chief Executive’s Statement
Introduction
Some two years ago we promised shareholders that a 
turnaround would be achieved in three half-year trading 
periods together with the creation of a platform for profitable 
growth. The Company was on track to deliver on this promise 
until the start of the last quarter of our financial year. 
Inevitably, we were affected by the rapid onset of the crisis in 
the financial services sector which is our main marketplace.
With an immediate focus by our customers on short-term 
reactions to the developing problems, decision times on new 
projects lengthened significantly in the closing months of the year 
under review. Some client companies sought to reduce capital 
expenditure on IT; others deferred projects on account of an 
unprecedented level of M&A activity in the sector. This resulted in 
some potential sales being deferred and others being cancelled. 
Also, some customer support contracts were lost when these 
customers ceased trading or were merged into other entities.
Within the past few months, the stronger financial services 
businesses have begun to recognise the need for investment 
in IT projects which will reduce their costs, improve service 
levels and achieve payback in short time periods.
Business review
Strict control of costs
A tight control of costs has been maintained during the 
year. The increase in the total cost of sales to £1.8m (2008: 
£1.4m; restated 2008: £1.2m) reflects an increased use 
of IT sub-contractors during the year which, together with 
higher amortisation of development expenditure, resulted in 
a reduction in gross margins to 51% (2008: 65%; restated 
2008: 70%). Administrative costs were reduced to £2.6m 
(2008: restated £3.6m) and are budgeted to reduce further 
this year.
The Company moved into new offices in July 2008, incurring 
a one-off cost of £55,000. These new open plan offices have 
improved staff morale and team working as well as providing 
excellent new customer training facilities. 
Total one-off costs in the year were £112,000 (2008: 
£392,000) including the office move and a prior-year provision 
for ‘ex-pat’ tax equalisation.
A review of the treatment of capitalisation and amortisation of 
R&D expenditure under accounting standard IAS 38 resulted in 
an adjustment to the accounts for the year ended 31 January 
2008. Additional R&D capitalisation of £103,000 from direct 
costs and a £128,000 reduction in amortisation is reflected in 
a £231,000 increase in retained earnings on the balance sheet. 
These changes are non-cash items.
Market and business development
The Company’s sales efforts have been increased by the 
appointment in November 2008 of Robert Maxfield as Head 
of Sales. With greater focus on Business Development, 
together with an increased number of enquiries, the pipeline 
of potential sales is now stronger than at any time in the 
past 24 months as companies in the financial services sector 
seek to reduce their cost base. It is evident that the stronger 
companies in UK financial services have realised that improved 
operational management capability can help them to reduce 
costs, whilst also improving customer service and regulatory 
compliance.
The combination of software licences, software services and 
maintenance increased its contribution to 66% of revenue for 
the full year with the balance coming from implementation 
services. This compares with 56% for 2008 and only 36% 
in 2007.
Despite considerable restructuring amongst the eg customer 
base and some pressure to reduce the costs of contracted 
support, maintenance revenues have held up well and are 
expected to do so in the current year. 
New contract wins announced during the year under review 
included Nationwide Building Society’s Specialist Lending and 
Regional Brands, a software services project for The Co-
operative Financial Services, as well as implementations in 
The Co-operative Group and Resolution Health in South Africa.

These contract wins demonstrate continued interest in our 
products in core markets and internationally. 
During the year, work was undertaken on 25 software 
services projects for 11 clients including Aviva, The Co-
operative Financial Services, Capita, Liberty Life, Nationwide 
and Wesleyan Assurance. These projects largely involved 
integrating eg work manager® and eg operational 
intelligence® with enterprise workflow and content 
management systems, process modelling and simulation tools 
and corporate performance measurement tools.
Currently 10 customers are now using the latest releases of eg 
work manager® and eg operational intelligence® — the 
fastest take-up of a new product release in the Company’s history.
Product development & support
Investment in capitalised software development in the year 
was £528,000 (2008: £0.71m; restated 2008: £0.82m) and 
included a major project to improve the efficiency and quality 
of software developments to enable eg to undertake more 
development projects at lower cost.
Development to existing software products included:
> enhancement to eg activity manager™ using Microsoft 
Silverlight technology;
> increased archiving capability;
> implementation of fully automated work allocation to 
support large-scale work throughput volumes; and
> improved reporting for clients to provide B2B service level 
reports direct from eg work manager®.
Development of new software products included:
> development of eg work manager® (v5.1) and eg 
operational intelligence® (v2.1) for release in 2009, 
including conversion of report production to Microsoft SQL 
Server Reporting Services; and
> eg operational data views™ — a new product enabling 
clients to use eg work manager® data in other 
systems, develop customised reports and embed eg work 
manager® data in enterprise IT platforms.
During the year and since the year-end, good progress has 
been made in certification and accreditation including:
> Microsoft certification for eg work manager® v5.0 and 
eg operational intelligence® v2.0; 
> BBBEE (Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment) 
level 2 accreditation in South Africa (score out of 10 
with 1 being the highest. 2 is a high score for small/new 
enterprises, particularly a foreign entity); and
> Banking Sector Training and Education Authority 
(BANKSETA) accreditation in South Africa for eg 
Operational Management training.
Priorities for the future
Our plans to restore the Company to profitable growth were 
on track in the first half of the year but were interrupted by 
the challenging conditions in the financial services sector in 
the last six months.
However, there is now increasing interest in our applications 
and services as they help our customers to reduce costs and 
deliver guaranteed return on investment in six months.
Our strategy remains to continue our plans to achieve 
profitable growth for our shareholders by securing further 
new business in UK core markets and specific international 
markets, strict control of overheads and the pursuit of further 
opportunities to reduce costs.

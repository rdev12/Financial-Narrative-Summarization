(i)  Laird uses underlying results as key performance indicators. Underlying proﬁ t before tax and underlying earnings per share are stated before 
exceptional items, the amortisation of acquired intangible assets, deferred tax on acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the gain or loss on 
disposal of businesses and the impact arising from the fair valuing of ﬁ nancial instruments. The narrative that follows is based on underlying 
operating proﬁ t, underlying proﬁ t before tax and underlying earnings per share, as the directors believe that these provide a more consistent 
measure of operating performance.
*  The average number of shares in issue was 189.2 million in 2006 and 157.9 million in 2005. The 2005 earnings and dividend per share have

 2005 was a landmark year for ITV. We celebrated 
50 years of commercial broadcasting and delivered 
strong ﬁnancial growth. 
We are demonstrating leadership in the digital age by:
• expanding our successful family of channels and
investing in digital capacity;
• building our production business and exploiting 
our content across all platforms and media; and
• developing new revenue streams in pay and 
consumer businesses.
We also developed a new look and feel for ITV and 
its channels to reﬂect this new era.
We will continue to use our creativity to achieve
commercial success, delivering the highest-quality
programmes and services to viewers, advertisers
and consumers.

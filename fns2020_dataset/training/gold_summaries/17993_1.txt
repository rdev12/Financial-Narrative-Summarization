 Chief Executive’s Report
I am delighted to present to you my first report as Chief Executive. This year we are making significant additional
disclosures, which I hope will enhance shareholders understanding of the Group and its strategy. As is inevitable in
a Group of this size and diversity, there have been many performance highlights this year but also some areas of the
business which have found markets more challenging. 
Of particular note was the success of our operations in Kenya where a combination of good yields and improved
prices delivered significant additional profit. However, the introduction of new post-employment benefits
legislation in Bangladesh has meant that we have made a significant provision of £6.4 million this year against this
liability and the fall in the oil price hit our subsidiaries (AKD Engineering and AJT Engineering) in that sector
very hard. Unfortunately, the continuing weakness in the oil price and the resulting lack of orders for major capital
equipment from AKD Engineering meant that we had to close the company in July 2015. We also sold our
interest in Loddon Engineering, a Norfolk based stable manufacturer, to a subsidiary of the De Swart Group.
MANAGEMENT 
During the year we reviewed the management of the business. Camellia is diverse and complex in both its markets
and geographies and therefore having the right management in place is fundamental to driving performance. We
have made a number of changes to management and to reporting lines in order to increase skills, create clarity and
ensure proper accountability in the trading businesses. As a result the Group is now managed on a divisional rather
than geographic basis. A summary of the new structure together with the revised remit and membership of the
executive committees is set out in the corporate governance report.
BUSINESS STRATEGY
Whilst the overall Group strategy, which is set out on page 15, remains unchanged, each division is now expected to
perform against an agreed divisional strategy which sets out the goals and targets for the short and medium term.
The divisional strategies may be summarised as follows:
Agriculture. The Agriculture division has an exceptional collection of high quality assets spread across a variety of
geographies and crops.  There are however certain crops where we have scale and geographic spread and therefore
the opportunity to build a significant market presence. These are tea, macadamia and avocados. Here we will
continue to expand the planted area, enlarge our geographic spread and where appropriate move up the value
chain to protect future margins. For the remaining crops, where developing a significant market presence is not
practicable but where there are opportunities for profitable investment, we will continue to acquire assets in line
with the broader Group strategy.
Banking and Financial Services. During the year, the Group performed a strategic review of Duncan Lawrie to
establish the best future path for the business. As a result of that review, the Group has approved a new growth
strategy to invest in, and expand, Duncan Lawrie. Key components of the new strategy include building the
banking operations by increasing both lending and deposits; growing the wealth management business by
substantially increasing the assets under management and investing in people and infrastructure to ensure a market
leading suite of products and services for our clients. This strategy will require, inter alia, further investment in the
business and we have relaxed certain lending restrictions previously imposed by the Group. 
I anticipate that the strategy will take a number of years to execute and I am pleased to report the appointment of Sally
T ennant as the new Chair of Duncan Lawrie, subject to the appropriate regulatory approval, to assist the management
team in implementing that strategy.
The Group also has three associated companies in the financial services sector, one of which, BF&M, is included
as an associate from 1 July 2015 following a purchase of additional shares by the Group and a reassessment of our
relationship with BF&M. The Group will continue to monitor its investments in these companies and may
increase or decrease its holdings as appropriate.
Engineering 
Engineering North. AJT Engineering has been a strongly profitable business for the Group in the past but is
currently impacted by the low oil price and its effect on investment in the North Sea oil industry. As a result, AJT
Engineering has had to amend its strategy so as to react to the new environment. This has included taking steps to
reduce costs and diversify its customer base. AJT Engineering remains committed to providing a full service to its
customers and anticipates emerging from the current hiatus strongly positioned for the future.

Chief Executive’s Report
Engineering South. The principal driver of growth in Engineering South will be Abbey Metal Finishing (Amfin)
and its joint venture in Germany, Atfin. Under its new management team, Amfin has taken significant steps in the
last 12 months to focus its customer base, improve its delivery performance and return to profitability. The plan is
to complete these steps during 2016 and for Amfin to provide the Group with a return on the significant
investments made since the fire in 2010. Atfin is taking steps to diversify its customer base and is now moving
towards profitability. 
The remaining businesses in Engineering South are expected to grow organically over the coming years.
Food Service 
UK. ACS&T will continue to operate as a niche high quality operator in the storage and distribution of frozen
foods together with some ambient food service provision as demand and space allows. The business will expand
and invest where appropriate to continue to serve the needs of its customers.
Netherlands. Affish and Wylax, our fish trading and distribution businesses in the Netherlands, have struggled to
grow in tough economic conditions. However, following the recent appointment of a new managing director and
sales director, these businesses are now looking to expand both their product offering and customer base.
Investments 
Investment Portfolio. The Group has a portfolio, principally of listed investments, under the management of a full
time investment manager. The strategy remains to invest for the long term in high quality companies where we
believe that there is hidden value.
Investment Property. The Group is disclosing for the first time this year the current market value of the investment
property portfolio (page 59). The strategy is to continue to invest in quality assets where an appropriate yield may
be realised.
Collections. The Group has collections of art, philately and manuscripts under the management of a curating team.
These assets are regularly reviewed and are added to or sold as appropriate in order to enhance the collections.

T ea pricing and operations
India
Average tea prices in 2015 were up 3.8% in Rupees against 2014 levels, reflecting particularly good performances
from our Assam teas, but costs of production were also up, reflecting labour rate increases which impacted
margins. A new blending and packing facility for export teas was commissioned in Kolkata during the year with an
annual capacity of approximately 4 million kgs per annum.
Packet tea sale volumes were up 13.6% on 2014 in this competitive but growing sector of the Indian local tea
market. Instant Tea production was down 25% on 2014 with prices also slightly down. During the year, a solar
water heating unit was installed at the plant in order to reduce energy costs.
Rainforest Alliance Certification was achieved on all Assam and Darjeeling estates along with FSSC 22000
certification in the factories; ISO 22000 certification was achieved for the Dooars’ factories.

Bangladesh
Pricing was up 11% on the previous year due to improved demand at auction and a resumption of high duty
tariffs on imported tea. 
A project to create capacity for irrigation on two gardens commenced during the second quarter having been
delayed as a result of political disturbances. Total replanting achieved in the year was 115 Ha leaving a total of 385
Ha under rehabilitation at the end of the year in preparation for future replanting.
Kenya
As a result of lower production volumes across Kenya as a whole, tea prices were up 35.7% from the previous
year’s levels. The market for Kenya teas is largely an export one and prices are subject to significant volatility linked
to production volumes. Fluctuations in the tea price have a major impact on Group profitability.
We continue to produce good quality hand plucked tea, and mechanical harvesting continues on a trial basis.
During 2015, we established our first large-scale solar project. Significant reductions in carbon emissions have
been achieved as well as a reduction in power costs. 
All the estates and smallholders remain Rainforest Alliance certified and all factories are ISO 22000 compliant. 
Malawi
In Malawi we experienced highly erratic weather conditions which had a significant adverse effect on crop
volumes. The operations experienced serious flooding following drought conditions at the start of the year and
then drought conditions re-emerged for most of the year thereafter.
Pricing in 2015 was up 3% on 2014 levels but costs per kg increased significantly due to the lower crop,
inflationary pressure through substantial currency devaluation and significant wage increases. These circumstances
contributed to a substantial decline in the profitability of the tea operations in 2015. 
The Tea Association of Malawi, of which we are a leading member, in conjunction with the Ethical Tea
Partnership, signed up to an extensive five-year revitalisation programme for the industry aimed at addressing
workers’ wages, smallholder sustainability, product quality and replanting. 
All estates and smallholders are Rainforest Alliance certified. All factories are Fairtrade certified and two factories
continued with UTZ certification.

Macadamia Pricing
Pricing for macadamia in 2015 was up 15.3% on 2014 levels and set a record level for the global macadamia
kernel market due to continuing demand from China. 
Macadamia Operations
Malawi
Production of macadamia nuts was down 9.0% on the previous year due to the impact of dry weather conditions.
The processing facility once again achieved ISO 22000 certification.
South Africa
Volumes in 2015 were significantly ahead of last year. The development of Mambedi Estate to macadamia
orchards continues with 98 Ha planted in 2015. A further 80 Ha has been prepared for planting. The processing
factory successfully completed the first phase of upgrading to a modern state-of-the-art cracking facility. The plant
was also recertified under ISO 22000 for the 2015 season.
Kenya
New plantings continued with 158 Ha being planted in the year. Construction of a new cracking facility began in
April and good progress has been made to date. The facility is expected to open in June 2016.

Avocado Pricing and Operations
A record volume of 1.9 million cartons were exported: 17% up on 2014. The smallholder fruit volumes were
slightly lower than last year as a result of tight quality controls and lower availability of acceptably sized fruit.
Despite this, excellent returns were generated for growers from the fruit exported. The smallholder initiative
continues to gain momentum with the number of registered growers increasing each year. Pricing in 2015 was at
record levels (up 64% on 2014) as a result of demand from the European market.

Speciality Crops Pricing and Operations
Pricing for rubber in 2015 was 24.4% below 2014 due to the drop in oil prices making synthetic rubber more
price competitive than natural latex. There are also significant inventories of natural rubber building in South East
Asia which are contributing to the downward pressure on price.
Prices for California citrus were slightly up in the year. Reduced volumes in the year reflect the effect of the
decision to replace an area of mandarins with a different variety of citrus.
Both the maize and soya crops in Brazil sold at higher levels than anticipated.
Prices for fresh pineapple production in Kenya were marginally up.
Wine grape production in the Western Cape, South Africa was down 13% on last year but bottled wine
production and sale volumes were up. Results were in line with expectation although slightly down on the
previous year.
Pricing for pistachios in 2015 was 28% up on 2014 levels due to demand in the global market. 
Almond prices were also high but no contribution was attributed to Group profit in 2015 given the immature
nature of the trees. Revenues from almonds will be attributed to Group profit for 2016.
Forestry operations continued to produce satisfactory volumes for fuel wood and value addition products.
We continue to raise cattle on those areas of the Kakuzi Estate in Kenya unsuitable for crop development.
In total, the Agriculture division made a trading profit of £26.3 million (2014: £27.2 million) on turnover of
£186.5 million (2014: £164.2 million).
Banking and Financial Services
The low interest rate environment together with restrictions on lending imposed by the Group and costs
associated with adjusting to new regulatory requirements, have led to several years of losses at Duncan Lawrie. As a
result, the Group undertook a strategic review of the bank during the year, the result of which is the
implementation of the growth strategy described above. In 2015 the bank made losses which were significantly
above those incurred in 2014, reinforcing the need to execute the new strategy. These losses are likely to continue
into 2016 as the bank invests in clients, staff and systems.
Our two associated companies in Bangladesh, United Insurance and United Finance, both had a reasonable year
with profits marginally ahead of 2014.  
From 1 July 2015 we are accounting for BF&M, a Bermuda based insurance company, as an associate. BF&M had
a strong year in 2015 reporting a profit before tax of Bermudian Dollar 30.1 million (2014: Bermudian Dollar
26.7 million).
In total, the Banking and Financial Services division’s subsidiaries made a trading loss of £3.6m (2014: trading loss
£2.5m) on turnover of £13.1 million (2014: £12.4 million). In addition, our share of the results of associates
amounted to £4.2 million (2014: £1.1 million).
Engineering
Engineering North 
Engineering North had a difficult year with the fall in the oil price resulting in AJT Engineering in Aberdeen
struggling to fill its order book. T urnover at AJT Engineering fell from £12.0 million in 2014 to £9.6 million in
2015. In the current climate it is hard to predict the oil price and the impact that it may have on the industry in
Aberdeen and therefore the company is braced for another difficult year. 
Engineering South 
Engineering South had a transitional year with the sale and closure of Loddon Engineering and AKD Engineering
respectively, and new management teams appointed at Abbey Metal Finishing, Atfin and GU Cutting and
Grinding. The continuing turnaround at Abbey Metal Finishing and the disposal of the other loss making
businesses means that we anticipate a significantly improved performance in the coming year.
240068 Camellia R&A pp01-pp14  27/04/2016  10:51  Page 10 11
Chief Executive’s Report
In total, the Engineering division made a trading loss of £5.5 million (2014: trading loss £8.4 million) on turnover
of £24.1 million (£28.9 million). £4.3 million of the trading loss in 2015 related to AKD Engineering and
Loddon Engineering.
In addition, during the year we sold three properties and certain assets which were surplus to the requirements of
the Engineering division generating a net profit on sale of £3.7million (2014: nil).
Food Service
ACS&T had a better year than 2014 with turnover increasing by 7.5%, although the market remains competitive
in both the storage and distribution areas and as a result profits were marginally down. During the year we also
took possession of a new office building in Wolverhampton and implemented a new IT system at all our facilities
to manage logistics. In the Netherlands, both Affish and Wylax experienced challenging trading conditions. 
In total the Food Service division made a trading profit of £0.7 million (2014: £0.9 million) on turnover of
£31.9 million (2014: £30.9 million).
Investments
Investment Portfolio. Despite the significant fluctuations in both global equity and currency markets there was little
change in the value of the portfolio. The total value of the portfolio is £30.6 million (2014: £63.5 million)
reflecting the reclassification of our holding in BF&M as an associate.
Investment Property. The Group is disclosing for the first time this year the current market value of the investment
property portfolio (page 59). The Group took the opportunity during the year to acquire further land and
buildings at Linton Park. 
Collections.  The value of the collections is held at cost. A number of minor additions and disposals were made
during the year. 
LEGISLATIVE CHANGES
The Group is present in many jurisdictions, and is subject to local legislation. The following two issues either have
had, or are likely to have, a material impact on the Group.
� During 2015, a post-employment benefits law was introduced in Bangladesh entitling workers to a lump sum
payment on retirement or termination of employment based upon earnings and length of service. As a result
we have made a provision of £6.4 million to cover the potential liability of which £6.1 million relates to past
service costs.
� At the start of 2016, the Government of Malawi put forward new legislation which proposes, inter alia, the
conversion of all freehold property into 50 year leaseholds. The proposed legislation is under discussion and
has yet to be passed into law and many of the key provisions such as the costs of the leaseholds and the right
to renew leases are as yet unclear. The impact on the Group is therefore hard to assess at this time. 
DEVELOPMENT
During 2015 we continued to invest in the development of our assets and £19.4 million was spent on property,
plant and equipment and investment property (2014: £19.0 million) including the following key projects:
� Extension of the macadamia dehusking facility and the commencement of the building of the new macadamia
cracking plant in Kenya
� Phase 1 of the upgrading of the macadamia cracking facility in South Africa
� Improvements at four of our tea factories and to the packet tea and instant tea facilities
� Solar energy facilities in Kenya and India
� Significant irrigation projects across all of the agricultural operations 
� Construction of a new office building for ACS&T and an IT upgrade
240068 Camellia R&A pp01-pp14  27/04/2016  10:51  Page 11 Chief Executive’s Report

� Continuing improvement of our labour housing and facilities for our staff
� The acquisition of investment properties in the UK adjacent to our head office at Linton Park.
In addition to our continuous programme of replanting our tea areas, a programme to extend our planted areas
has been underway for a number of years and in 2015:
� 36 Ha of new avocado plantings were carried out in Kenya
� 158 Ha of new macadamia plantings were carried out in Kenya and 81 Ha in South Africa.
SUSTAINABILITY AND CSR
The Group has always had a strong focus on social and environmental responsibility and this is something we
intend to maintain and grow. The key aspects of that policy are set out on page 17.
The Group strives to develop the workforce through training and to improve housing, healthcare, and education
across the Group and in the communities that we work in.
This year we have been involved in the tea revitalisation project in Malawi, solar projects in India and Kenya, and have
embarked on major housing renewal projects in Malawi, Kenya and India. In addition, I am pleased to report that
every operating company in the UK has now been accredited by the Living Wage Foundation as a Living Wage
Employer.

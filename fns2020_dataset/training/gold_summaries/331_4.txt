AMS provides a full range of advanced woundcare products for sale in
hospital, nursing home and community care markets. The main
indications are for chronic wounds such as ulcers and pressure sores.
These products pioneer the concept of moist wound healing to allow
wounds to heal faster and with less pain and scarring if they remain moist.
They protect the wound, deal with tissue fluids and provide an optimal
environment for healing to occur.

advanced woundcare routes to market
AMS has successfully adopted a three tier route to market strategy:
Branded Partners — The Group believes that the most effective way of rapidly commercialising new technologies/concepts on a global
basis is through strategic partnerships with major branded companies.
Private Label — AMS also addresses the increasing trend towards private label in advanced woundcare, driven by cost constraints by
health care providers, by provision of own label products to distributors. These products allow savings to be made on treatment of routine
wounds alongside the use of the new innovative products for more difficult wounds.
Direct — AMS sells direct to the NHS in its own home market.

wound closure and sealants
Our wound closure and sealants products are based on cyanoacrylate
adhesive technology developed for medical applications.
Tissue adhesives offer significant benefits over convential ways of closing
wounds following trauma or surgical incision.
They are simple to use, non-invasive, help to reduce the risk of infection,
minmise trauma to the patient and provide good clinical and cosmetic
outcomes.
The technology is also ideally suited to protecting skin from breakdown
or for use as a skin sealant to help prevent infection of surgical sites.

wound closure and sealants routes to market
The use of tissue adhesives and sealants is still a relatively new concept and requires market creation, education and development.
Products are taken to market either through a major branded partner or under our own LiquiBand® brand, direct in the UK and via
distributors in Europe.

 08 LiDCO Annual Report 2008/09
Chief Executive Officer’s Statement
The recent launch of the LiDCOrapid monitor
was an important milestone for the Company
with excellent initial market acceptance resulting
in us seeing good demand for the product.
Although still at an early stage, the strategy to
access the surgery market in order to swiftly grow
the installed base and secure a faster growing
recurring revenue stream is already showing much
promise.
Broadening LiDCO’s product range –
the launch of the LiDCOrapid
One year on from the launch of the LiDCOrapid I am
delighted to report that there has been an excellent initial
market acceptance. The launch of this product allows
LiDCO, and our distribution partners, to address an
additional market that we estimate to be potentially worth
US$800m per annum. From April 2008 to January 2009,
279 LiDCOrapid monitors have been sold or placed with
distributors and hospital customers. The number of patients
undergoing high risk surgery is higher than the numbers of
patients admitted to the intensive care unit, thus the
surgical market represents the biggest potential revenue
stream for our technology.
The Company now has products to access two markets –
the intensive care patient with the LiDCOplus technology
and the high-risk surgery patient with the LiDCOrapid.
Accordingly, looking at the last year we have seen the
biggest yearly increase in our monitor installed-base since
we started trading. Strong demand for our new surgery
product means that our installed base of both types of our
monitors stands at 1,510 units at the year-end.
Broadening our network of distributors –
improving the channels to market
LiDCO’s strategy is to increase sales by predominantly
using a distribution route to market, rather than increasing
its own sales force. During the year we have added 13 new
distributors, covering 18 countries and have considerably
increased the number of sales personnel now selling our
technology. As planned, we have added distributors in all
our major markets including North America, Continental
Europe, the Middle East and Asia. Our distribution partners
are major players in their respective markets and LiDCO
products are now available in 47 countries worldwide.
Our technology is attractive to distributors due to the
market growth rate, potential and product margin.
Overview
Achievements
This last year has been highly significant for
LiDCO, with the Company successfully achieving
its goals, which were to:
1. Continue to grow income and progress toward
profitability.
2. Strengthen the product range and address the
surgery market.
3. Accelerate the growth of the installed user base.
4. Significantly broaden the network of distributors. 09 LiDCO Annual Report 2008/09
The launch of the LiDCOrapid significantly increased the
market potential for our products. As anticipated, we then
saw an increased interest in selling or co-promoting our
products from a number of distributors in new territories
and from a major corporation (Becton Dickinson). With the
expansion of our product line and the growing global interest
in better fluid management and targeted oxygen delivery,
our sales partners are showing an increasing commitment to
investing the time and resources necessary to develop their
respective markets. Following the launch of the LiDCOrapid
and appointment of the new distributors in the first half of
the year, we saw second half revenues increase over the first
half by 24%. Distributors accounted for 76% of the 279
LiDCOrapid monitors sold or placed since April. We anticipate
an increasing distribution sales revenue contribution as the
full effect of the increased distributor appointments starts to
be seen.
One of the most important appointments made was in July
when we announced that LiDCO had signed an exclusive
distribution agreement with KOL Bio Medical Instruments
(KOL) for the sale of the LiDCOrapid monitor in the eastern
side of the US. As a result, including our own direct sales force,
we now have access to around 40% of US hospitals. KOL is
establishing a strong pipeline of customers.
More recently, in April we announced a significant expansion
of our existing marketing collaboration with Becton Dickinson
(‘BD’), a multi-billion dollar global medical technology
company. BD has made an upfront payment for a license to
sell (following registration and reimbursement) the LIDCOrapid
in Japan. In addition, we have expanded our co-marketing
arrangements with BD beyond the original UK agreement,
to cover a number of export territories. This marketing
partnership aims to enhance sales coverage for BD’s and
LiDCO’s product lines. BD is one of the world’s biggest global
suppliers of medical disposables to the surgery and critical care
market. BD is a very important and influential corporate
partner for us. The reputation of the LiDCO brand amongst
our customers was a key factor in BD’s decision to extend this
exclusive collaboration. Their increased commitment to
working with us is reflective of a growing belief within the
medical device industry that hemodynamic monitoring is a
market with strong growth potential.
Market trends/Prospects for sales
The worldwide market for hemodynamic monitoring products
continues to experience significant growth. We estimate sales
revenues (worldwide) for minimally invasive hemodynamic
monitoring products grew by 28% from £68m to £87m
during 2008. This followed growth of 33% in reported
revenues in the prior year. The move away from the use of
the older, invasive catheter products towards the newer, less
invasive devices reflects a shift in attitude of both hospitals and
insurers. Dr David Green at King’s College Hospital, London
recently reported to the Portuguese national anesthetists’
meeting that he had been able to more than halve his use of
central venous catheters from 85% to 35% of his high-risk
surgery patients by using the LiDCOrapid. LiDCO is therefore
well placed to benefit from the USA’s Medicare decision to no
longer pay hospitals for the cost of treatment of catheter and
surgery related complications and infections. Not only can
the technology be used to reduce the requirement to insert
a central catheter for fluid management – we have also
demonstrated that use of oxygen delivery targeting using
LiDCOplus technology on high-risk surgery patients can
reduce:
• complications by more than one third¹
• costs by £4,800 on average per patient
• hospital stay per patient by an average of 12 days
These benefits have been estimated to save a single hospital
up to £2m per year.

Sales and trading
Revenues were up 12% to £4.53m (2007: £4.05), this
increase understates the much more pronounced growth in
the monitor installed base and underlying disposables
income growth. Disposable revenue growth and higher
numbers of monitors placed have been driven by the launch
of the LiDCOrapid and by our expanded distribution
network. The focus necessary to launch and promote the
LiDCOrapid had a knock-on effect on the growth and capital
revenues from sales of our ICU product – the LiDCOplus
monitor. As a result the LiDCOplus monitor installed base
continued to grow, but at a slower rate compared to 2008.
Due to the price differential between the LiDCOrapid
monitor and the more expensive LiDCOplus monitor, the
modest increase in monitor revenues (1%) across the period
belies the considerable increase (up 116% at 326 units
compared with 151 units in 2007/8) in units sold and
placed. Better, and still emerging, evidence of the
underlying good commercial progress was seen in the
associated disposables income which was up 26% to £2.5m
(2007/8 £1.99m), as smart card income from the
LiDCOrapid base starts to augment existing LiDCOplus
sensor income.
These results underplay the full impact that the launch
of the LiDCOrapid and increase in the distributor sales
force are likely to have in the future on disposables sales.
We anticipate that our products will exhibit higher
disposable usage, as the monitors are transferred from
distributors and ultimately into full use in hospitals.
LiDCOrapid smart card sales revenues should produce a fast
growing and secure income stream. LiDCO is well placed to
benefit from the shift away from invasive catheter-based
hemodynamic monitoring. We now have the sales reach to
ensure we are more adequately represented when hospitals
are making this decision.
Although the world economy is in a significant downturn,
healthcare is one of the most defended expenditures made
by developed societies. Healthcare expenditure in the USA
rose to $2.4 trillion in 2008 according to figures released
by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).
This represents a 6.1% increase, outpacing economic
growth in the US, which was 3.5% in 2008. Healthcare
expenditure is projected (March 2009, Clinica) to increase
by 5.5% in 2009. Our expectation is that, despite
recessionary pressures, the hemodynamic monitoring
market will continue to grow in 2009. Hospitals are
increasingly looking to improve profitability through
improved efficacy of treatments and reduced complications.
Patients with complications tend to require extended
hospital stay and this costs a disproportionate amount.
However, while anticipating continued growth for the
minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring market, we are
seeing a significant shift regarding how hospitals propose to
pay for the adoption of this technology. Revenue budgets
will be progressively more used, as capital equipment
purchase budgets will be put on hold. We have therefore
prudently made an allowance for this trend in our sales
forecasting. There will be significantly more product
placements (where the monitor is given to a hospital at no
cost but the disposables incur a higher charge) and use of
revenue budget streams than has been the case in the last
few years. We started to see this happening towards the
end of 2008 and this will impact on capital sales revenue
in our direct and distributor markets, particularly the USA.
The strong LiDCO brand strengths of safety, minimally
invasive monitoring, accuracy and ease-of-use, are
increasingly being accepted by the clinical community.
This is evidenced by the choice of our technology for use
in key outcome studies and the continued expansion of
our customer base. With the launch of the LiDCOrapid
and expansion of distribution partners we have the
products, structure and sales resources to progress further
during 2009.

Geographic segmental sales reporting
Revenues were up by between 18 – 25% in the UK,
Continental Europe and the Rest of the World territories.
Disposables revenues were up in all territories by between
14 – 56%. All territories showed significant increases in the
LiDCO monitor installed base. However, in the USA revenues
were down, despite a rise of 14% in recurring disposables
income. This was a consequence of hospitals acquiring the
LiDCOrapid, rather than the more expensive LiDCOplus
monitor, and simultaneously more customers requiring
monitor placements, rather than exclusively following a
capital purchase route. This resulted in a reduction in
reported capital sales revenues (£0.46m vs. 2007/08
£0.75m). Despite this revenue reduction, in the USA the
installed base increased more strongly than in the prior
year by 77 monitors, which was up almost double (93%)
the increase seen in the prior year.
We are expecting good sales revenue growth in all
territories during 2009, as the installed base begins to
contribute further to disposable revenues augmented by
an additional income stream from our new distributors.

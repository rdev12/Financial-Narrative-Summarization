WALKER GREENBANK PLC
Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Overview
I am pleased to report that the 
Group continues to make good progress 
and has delivered another significant 
increase in profitability and dividend 
payments, reflecting our continued focus 
on developing our product offering, market 
penetration, manufacturing capability and 
international expansion.
We continue to deliver our strategy through 
further investment in product development, 
sales and marketing and manufacturing. 
During the year we invested in additional 
digital printers at both of our manufacturing 
sites to meet demand and to allow continued 
innovation in our printing techniques. We 
also opened a second warehouse in Milton 
Keynes for our wallcoverings storage and 
distribution. The major extension and 
refurbishment of our flagship New York 
showroom was officially opened in October 
2014 and has helped to drive US sales in the 
latter part of the year. 
Total Brand sales were up 6.4% during the 
year at £64.7 million. The UK, our largest 
market, delivered a strong sales performance, 
up 10.3% at £38.5 million, reflecting strong 
retail sales and a continuing resurgence of 
the contract market.
Our overseas Brand sales were up 1.5% 
in reportable currency, 5.1 % in constant 
currency, impacted by the strength of 
sterling. Sales in Western Europe, the 
Group’s second biggest market, were up 
4.8% in reportable currency, 11.4% in 
constant currency, driven by strong sales 
growth in most regions. In the US, our  
third largest market, sales grew 0.7% in 
reportable currency, 5.1 % in constant 
currency. Sales were impacted by the six 
month closure of the New York showroom; 
since the reopening, and with an improving 
economic environment, we achieved strong 
double-digit growth in the last quarter of 
the financial year. 
Brand sales in the Middle East grew by 
20.1 % in constant currency aided by the 
opening of the Dubai showroom in Q3 2013. 
Sales in the Rest of the World grew 1.0% 
in constant currency held back by market 
conditions in Japan as a result of the 
increase in consumption tax and the 
impact of sterling. 
Licensing income of £2.1 million was down 
2.4% in reportable currency, up 3.6% in 
constant currency, reflecting the weakness 
of the yen and a strong comparator last 
year following the 150
th
 anniversary of 
Morris & Co. We are pursuing the extension 
of our product offering through new licensing 
arrangements and recently appointed a 
dedicated Licence Director. We remain 
confident about the future potential for  
this important strategic contributor to  
our growth.
Our UK manufacturing base is a key asset 
that differentiates us from others in our 
industry and puts us at the forefront of 
innovation in printing techniques. Our 
continuing investment in new digital printers 
has helped us grow our manufacturing sales 
and profits on what was a record year last 
year. We are particularly pleased by the 
8.1 % growth in UK manufacturing sales to 
external customers, a large proportion of 
which is driven by digital printing.
We have progressed our digital sales and 
marketing strategy by launching updated 
industry-leading websites for each of  
our brands and by the launch of a  
new functional website, Style Library  
(www.stylelibrary.com), which showcases  
all of the Group’s products. These websites 
have B2B and B2C e-commerce capabilities 
and, during the second half of the year, we 
launched our B2B e-commerce platform 
with our customers in the US.
Financials
Total sales increased 6.3% to £83.4 million 
(2014: £78.4 million). The operating profit 
before an accounting charge relating to  
the Long-Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) rose 
11.0% to £8.34 million (2014: £7.51 million). 
The profit from operations was up 12.1 %  
to £7.34 million (2014: £6.54 million).  
The interest charge has increased from 
£180,000 to £208,000 due to higher 
average borrowings. The defined benefit 
pension charge has reduced from £868,000 
to £798,000 driven by a reduction in the 
service cost.
Profit before tax excluding the LTIP 
accounting charge and the net defined 
benefit charge was £8.13 million (2014: 
£7.33 million), an increase of 10.9%. The 
profit before tax after the two non-cash 
charges was £6.33 million (2014: £5.50 
million). The profit after tax was £5.11 
million (2014: £5.04 million) and basic 
adjusted earnings per share were up 3.0% 
after removing the LTIP accounting charge, 
net defined benefit charge and the deferred 
tax credit arising from the LTIP.
The cash inflow from operating activities was 
£3.26 million (2014: £5.95 million), reflecting 
strong operating profits and also significant 
investment in product. The Group has 
continued to invest in the period with capital 
expenditure of £3.25 million (2014: £4.74 
million). 
Dividend
During the year, the Group has paid a final 
dividend for the year to 31 January 2014 of 
1.57p per share and an interim dividend of 
0.35p per share. The Directors recommend 
the payment of a final dividend of 1.96p per 
share (2014: 1.57p) which will be payable on 
7 August 2015 to shareholders on the register 
on 17 July 2015. This brings the total dividend 
for the year to 2.31p per share (2014: 1.85p) 
an increase of 24.9% which reflects 
Directors’ confidence in the future prospects 
and financial strength of the Group. 
People
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank 
all of our management and employees for 
their contribution to another successful year. 
Outlook
The current financial year has started well. 
In the first 10 weeks our total Brands sales 
are up 7.9% in reportable currency, 8.6% in 
constant currency compared with the same 
period last year with sales in the UK, our 
largest market up, 8.1 %. Overseas Brand 
sales are up 7.6% in reportable currency, 
9.5% in constant currency. Manufacturing 
has continued to performed well.
We are excited by our new product launches, 
including the third collection from the 
Anthology brand and by Zoffany’s spring 
launch which will be its biggest launch in six 
years. We look forward with confidence to 
the year ahead.

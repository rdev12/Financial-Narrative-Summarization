 CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT REGIONAL CONSTRUCTION & 
NATIONAL RETAIL ANd LEISURE
Regional Construction
The Regional Construction businesses 
had a strong year with volumes increasing 
44% to £302m (2007 - £210m) and fee 
income increasing 33% to £39.7m (2007 - 
£29.9m). Excluding the acquisition of Pearce 
Construction, organic growth was 22% in 
volume and 10% in fee income. Operating 
profit increased by 20% to £1.8m (2007 
- £1.5m). The result has been impacted 
by a £0.5m provision against an insurance 
recovery that is currently under dispute 
and a £0.5m provision against the carrying 
value of one of the two remaining properties 
held for development. As anticipated at 
acquisition, Pearce Construction contributed 
an operating profit of £0.2m as the business 
was completing a number of challenging 
projects with low inherent margins. With the 
recruitment of a new divisional director now 
in place, we are anticipating a substantial 
improvement in the current year. 
Operationally, notable successes in the period 
were the delivery of the fit out of new offices 
for the lawyers Halliwells in Manchester, a 
hotel for Holiday Inn in Burnley, the fit out 
of new offices for Cadbury Trebor Basset in 
Edgbaston, two Village Hotels in Ashton Moss 
and Leeds, an industrial building in Royston, 
an affordable housing scheme for Sanctuary 
in Barnet and an Extra Care housing scheme 
for Moorland. In addition we are making good 
progress on the Nelson and Colne College 
in Lancashire, the fit out of retail areas at 
Manchester Airport, the redevelopment of the 
Civic Building in Barnsley, the refurbishment 
of Her Majesty’s Prison Hindley and Lancaster 
Castle and offices in Rotherham.
Across our Regional Construction businesses 
we now have the benefit of 18 public sector 
frameworks covering affordable housing, local 
authorities and prisons. We anticipate that 
these will contribute £63m of revenue in the 
next financial year (2008 - £31m), of which 
£41m is already secured.
 
Our Regional Construction businesses start 
the year with an increased order book, 
up 30% at £305m (2007 - £234m) and an 
increase of 17% excluding the impact of 
acquisitions. 51% of the June 2008 order 
book relates to public sector spend and with 
further wins anticipated in the education and 
social housing sectors, we would expect the 
proportion of public sector work to continue 
to increase.
National Retail and Leisure
Overall our National Retail and Leisure 
operations performed well during the year, 
with volumes increasing by 145% to £137m 
(2007 - £56m) and fee income increasing by 
154% to £24.9m (2007 - £9.8m). The results 
include full year contributions from ISG 
Cathedral (2007 - eleven weeks) and an  
seven and a half month contribution from 
Pearce Retail.  
Operating profit increased by 99% to 
£3.9m (2007 - £2.0m), resulting in an 
operating margin on fee income of 15.8% 
(2007 - 20.2%). The results benefited from 
the inclusion of ISG Cathedral and Pearce 
Retail but the operating margins have been 
impacted by an underperformance in ISG 
Dean and Bowes in the second half of the 
year due to the well publicised lower high 
street fashion retail spend and a challenging 
project for one of our retail clients.  
27228_Text.indd   17 30/10/08   14:52:05 With the addition of Pearce Retail, the 
businesses are now operating across four key 
sectors; financial, food, high street fashion 
and leisure. In the financial and food sectors, 
both operate largely under framework 
arrangements. Work is generally allocated six 
months in advance and we are pleased with 
the current allocations for 2008/09 which we 
believe should result in activity levels above 
those of the prior year. In the high street 
fashion and leisure sectors, work is allocated 
more on a relationship driven, contract 
by contract basis. Whilst we have seen a 
slowdown in the high street fashion sector, 
we have compensated for this by moving 
some of our resources into a number of hotel 
refurbishment projects.
As a result of the above, our order book of 
secured and allocated projects as at June 
2008 is £173m (2007 - £51m), up 37% 
excluding the impact of acquisitions.

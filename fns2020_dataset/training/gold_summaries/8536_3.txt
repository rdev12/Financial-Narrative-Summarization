 Established brands
A track record of organising highly-
effective exhibitions and conferences
combined with a professional approach to
sales, marketing and event management
has resulted in rising brand values for our
key events and stronger portfolios.
Our exhibitions and conferences serve a
wide range of industries, including the
food & drink sector . Event staff build a
strong industry and territory knowledge
and are well placed to advise our
customers about the markets that might
best suit their development plans. Our
‘World Food’ and ‘Interfood’ brands now
include 10 events in countries such as
Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Azerbaijan
and T ajikistan.
Our exhibitions and conferences are
highly respected as ‘must-attend’ events
and a fine example is World Food Moscow .
In the last five years, the exhibition has
grown by 69% and now hosts over 
1,300 exhibitors from 53 countries. 
The success and reputation of events 
like World Food Moscow results in high
levels of re-bookings providing a firm
foundation for future growth.

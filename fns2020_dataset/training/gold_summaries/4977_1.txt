 We are investing in senior managers to develop
such markets as Africa, the Far East and Asia,
and looking further into the future, South
America. We also see the larger international
projects as a source for providing services 
wider than our current offering and we are
looking to secure work of a more strategic
consultancy nature; to this end we will invest 
in a senior manager with experience and
contacts in this area.
Middle East
Revenues from the Middle East increased by
85% and segmental profits rose by 80% and 
the region now represents a material and
growing revenue stream. The services we
provide in the region are wider than those 
we currently provide in the UK. They cover
contract document preparation, employer’s
representative roles and contract administration
as well as the claims, dispute and expert
witness services traditionally provided in the
UK. The success of these wider services has
prompted plans to widen the service offering
across the whole Group in future years.
The media has reported widely on the turbulent
market in Dubai and our experience over the
period reflected this, with all our appointments
on live project services terminated during late
2008 and early 2009. However, our live project
services work in Abu Dhabi was not affected 
and during the remainder of the year the 
Dubai market saw an increase in demand for 
our dispute resolution services. Our business 
in the United Arab Emirates as a whole
therefore experienced an increase in revenue 
of 17% in the year .
Our Oman business has continued to grow
significantly in the year with revenue increasing
four fold, from £0.8m to £3m, and segmental
profits rising five-fold from £0.2m to £1m. 
In fact, revenue and profit would have been
higher had a major dispute, on which we were
providing expert services, not settled earlier
than expected, in June 2009. Our primary
clients are the Omani government, where we
work for several governmental ministries, 
and major contracting organisations. The
performance of this office is particularly
pleasing given that it was only opened in the
previous financial year . 
COMMERCIAL MANAGEMENT 
CONSULTANTS (“CMC”)
The integration of CMC has been successful and
the business delivered its first full year trading
contribution since its acquisition in February
2008. During the year, we merged CMC’s
Dartford office with the Group’s London office
resulting in reduced overheads. This completed
the office merger programme, which
commenced the previous year when CMC’s
Glasgow and Manchester offices were merged
with existing Group offices.
While CMC has been affected by the decline in
the live project market in the UK, its focus on
larger infrastructure projects around London
and the South East has largely insulated the
business from much of the impact. Revenue 
and profits have been maintained at full year
underlying levels similar to the previous year . 
We see opportunities to expand the business into
the industrial and process plant maintenance
sectors and to widen the services CMC offers to
include project planning. We also have plans to
develop CMC in Europe using our contacts
established in our Driver Consult International
Operations and a new Managing Director has
been identified to deliver this strategy. 
OUTLOOK
We do not anticipate any overall growth in the
UK market in the near term. Although it is
expected that our expert witness and litigation
support services will grow, this is unlikely to
offset the continued decline in the services 
we offer to the live construction and
engineering sectors.
The Middle East region is set to continue to
grow and we are looking at opportunities 
to develop into other countries in the region
adopting the successful model in place in 
Oman. We will also seek to expand our staff
levels providing dispute resolution and expert
witness services in the region.
Our longer term plans are to position the 
Group as a global construction management
consultant and over the course of this coming
year, we will continue to implement our
initiatives to position ourselves for these longer
term aims as well as ensure that the Group is
best able to face the challenges in the current
economic climate, particularly in the UK and
Europe. In focusing on overseas expansion, we
expect to be active in Europe, Middle East and
Africa during the coming year and are seeking 
a point of entry into the Far East and Asia. We
will also be investing in senior managers with a
track record of providing the wider consultancy
services we seek to offer .
We have planned for an additional £1m of
revenue investment in excess of our usual
budget levels for business development, and
anticipate that our track record to-date of
successfully expanding the Group will hold us in
good stead for this future development. These
plans are set out over a three year period and we
look forward to reporting on the successful
progress towards this aim during the coming year .

DRIVER GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2009
59930_DRIVER_REPORT 1-60_mk2.pdf   7 59930_DRIVER_REPORT 1-60_mk2.pdf   7 28/01/2010   11:06 28/01/2010   11:06 RESULTS
Revenue increased by 13% to £20.5m 
(2008: £18.2m). This included the full year
benefit from Commercial Management
Consultants Ltd (“CMC”) which was acquired 
on 29th February 2008. The Chief Executive’s
report describes the business segmental
performance in more detail.
Underlying* operating profit for the year ending
30 September 2009, fell by 47% to £1.13m
(2008: £2.13m). Reported operating profit
decreased by £0.96m to £1.07m (2008: £2.03m).
As a result of the downturn in the domestic
construction market the Driver Consult UK
business segment revenue reduced by £2.12m
to £10.82m and profits also fell, by £1.53m to
£1.45m. The Middle East business generated
revenue growth of £2.64m, increasing revenue
to £5.75m (2008: £3.11m) and profits increased
by £0.43m to £0.97m (2008: £0.54m) with
operating margin largely unchanged. CMC
revenue increased by £1.84m to £4.36m 
(2008: £2.52m) and profits increased by £0.07m
to £0.42m (2008: £0.35m), and benefited from 
a full year contribution from the business,
contrasting with seven months contribution 
in 2008. With a continued focus on cost
management, unallocated corporate costs were
marginally lower than the prior year at £1.72m
(2008: £1.75m), reflecting careful management
of central and unallocated spend.
The Group had to increase its provision against
bad and doubtful debts from £0.1m at 
30th September 2008 to £0.3m at the year 
end, a consequence of an increase in clients
becoming insolvent due to the weaker economic
conditions in the UK construction industry. 
A further consequence of the economic
downturn has been a necessity to rationalise
staff numbers across the Group at a total cost
during the year of £0.2m (2008: nil).
The net interest charge fell by £31,000 to
£17,000, reflecting both good cash management
as well as the lower interest rate environment. 
The Company aims to incentivise key
management through the use of share options.
The IFRS2 (share-based payment) charge for
these totalled £59,000 (2008: £97,000). The
reduction in the charge reflects the saving on
the cumulative cost of share based payments
following the redundancies.
Underlying* profit before tax was £1.11m 
(2008: £2.08m). Reported profit before tax was
£1.05m (2008: £1.98m). 
TAXATION
The Company’s taxation charge was £0.28m
(2008: £0.57m). The effective tax rate was 
26% (2008: 29%). The current year tax charge
includes the benefit of a lower tax rate on
Omani profits, but is partly offset by an 
increase in disallowable costs in the UK. 
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Underlying* basic earnings per share (“EPS”)
was 3.4 pence (2008: 6.3 pence), a reduction of
46%. Basic EPS was 3.2 pence (2008: 5.8 pence). 
CASH FLOW
Despite the lower profit, cash generation
remained healthy with net cash inflow from
operating activities of £1.09m (2008: £1.39m).
Tight management of debtors remains key 
to the Group, and overdue debtors in excess 
of 30 days overdue fell 20% to £0.20m 
(2008: £0.25m). With both the benefit of
continued good management of debtors
together with the reduction in revenue, 
absolute levels of debtors have fallen over 
the year contributing £0.26m to cash flow 
(2008: outflow of £0.88m). 
Other major cash movements in the year
included spend on capital items of £0.33m
(2008: £0.11m) and dividends paid in the year 
of £0.74m (2008: £0.69m). 
The Company’s net borrowings position at 
the end of the year was largely unchanged 
from the prior year with net borrowings of
£0.16m (2008: net borrowings of £0.17m).

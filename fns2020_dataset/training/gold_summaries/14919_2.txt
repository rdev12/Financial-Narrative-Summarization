 SThree plc 5
Financial Highlights 
for the year ended 28 November 2010
“SThree delivered a strong result in 2010 in a market which was still some way 
from fully recovered. Sentiment improved steadily and we ended the year with all 
our markets and territories in growth. We were also pleased with the increasing 
momentum in our longer established businesses building towards the end of the 
year. Looking ahead, we remain well positioned to make further progress through 
a combination of expansion in existing markets and further investment in new 
geographies with their substantial structural growth potential.”

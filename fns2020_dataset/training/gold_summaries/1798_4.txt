 Focused on growth markets 
The global infrastructure market is estimated 
at £8trn over the next four years, with higher 
growth rates in Australia and Asia, South 
America, Africa and Middle East.
Organic growth and recent acquisitions have 
added to our global scale; we are now one of 
the largest players in infrastructure by revenue. 
Our international reach and ability to access 
growth markets have been greatly enhanced 
in recent years, particularly with the addition 
of professional services capability. We are 
already in Asia and the Middle East, and we 
are intensifying our focus on geographies and 
sectors such as the ones below where we 
see opportunities for growth.

Focus on customers’ assets 
Our customers are owners of large and complex assets. They view 
their assets strategically and often want to work with people who 
can share the big picture with them.
Increasingly our organisation is structured to identify customers’ 
strategic objectives and to deliver our collective services to meet 
these objectives. This is about focusing on our customers and their 
assets which goes beyond our work on any single project.
By capturing and sharing our knowledge across the whole asset 
lifecycle and deploying this knowledge for our customers, we 
differentiate ourselves from competitors and maximise value both 
for those customers and for the Group.
Breadth of capability
With more comprehensive capabilities than our international 
peers, we can address a broader range of infrastructure 
markets and customers. For management purposes our 
businesses are structured into four complementary divisions:
•	 Professional Services (see page 28)
•	 Construction Services (see page 32)
•	 Support Services (see page 37)
•	 Infrastructure Investments (see page 40)
Our ability to build project teams integrating capabilities 
from across these divisions gives us real competitive edge, 
providing a strong platform for growth and value creation.

Efficiency 
Through broadening the scope of our current cost efficiency 
programme over the next few years, we will capture 
efficiencies from a larger cost base. Cost efficiency will 
be targeted at the highest possible organisational and 
geographical level and will not jeopardise our focus on 
customers or asset knowledge. 
Balance sheet strength
Infrastructure projects are long term and large in value. Being 
able to demonstrate that we have the financial strength to 
complete them is fundamental. We maintain positive cash and 
PPP assets to balance against our pension deficit and negative 
working capital.

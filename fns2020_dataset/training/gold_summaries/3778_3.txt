 Communisis plc – Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011
RESUL TS
Communisis delivered substantial growth in profit from 
operations before exceptional items in 2011. The Group made 
real progress during the year towards its dual aspirations to 
be the leading UK marketing services provider with a growing 
customer-led international profile and to achieve a double-digit 
operating margin on sales (excluding pass through) over the 
medium term.
Profit from operations before exceptional items increased to 
£9.4m, a 19% increase on 2010. This represented an operating 
margin of 5.5% on sales (excluding pass through) compared to 
4.7% in 2010. The net effect of exceptional items was to reduce 
profit after tax and basic earnings per share from £4.4m to £4.1m 
and from 3.20p to 2.96p respectively. Exceptional items related 
principally to the costs of a phased restructuring programme 
with £3.7m charged in 2011 (2010 £2.9m offset by a £2.6m 
gain on the settlement of certain pension obligations). Adjusted 
earnings per share, which excluded the after-tax effect of 
exceptional items, increased by 47.5% from 2.99p to 4.41p. 
The proposed final dividend of 1p per share brings the total 
dividend for the year to 1.5p per share an increase of 16% over 
2010, reflecting both the strong operating performance in 2011 
and the Board’s confidence in the future of the business. The 
dividend will be payable on 14 May 2012 to shareholders on the 
register at 13 April 2012.
BOARD CHANGES
As reported in the 2010 Annual Report, Nigel Howes assumed 
the Finance Director role in March 2011.
In November 2011 Alistair Blaxill resigned from the Board 
and Dave Rushton took over his responsibilities having been 
promoted to the newly created position of Group Managing 
Director.
Roger Jennings is not seeking re-appointment at the Annual 
General Meeting on 2 May 2012 having served for nine years as 
a non-executive director. The Board would like to thank Roger 
for his significant contribution over this long period during which 
Communisis has changed considerably.
The Board, through its Nomination Committee, expects to 
appoint a further non-executive director in due course.
OUTLOOK
T rading in the early weeks of 2012, together with new and 
existing customer prospects, supports our expectation of further 
financial progress for the current year as a whole.
Macro-economic uncertainties are expected to continue during 
2012. Such factors are less likely to impact our activities in 
transactional and regulatory communications but could affect 
our customers’ discretionary marketing spend. 
This situation provides both challenge and opportunity as 
marketeers seek to improve their investment returns or decide 
to outsource more of their core marketing services. Communisis 
continues to deploy advanced technology and invest in people 
with the skills and experience to deliver its broader proposition. 
The Group is therefore well positioned to benefit from the 
developing trends towards more personalised and targeted 
marketing campaigns and further outsourcing of marketing 
activities.

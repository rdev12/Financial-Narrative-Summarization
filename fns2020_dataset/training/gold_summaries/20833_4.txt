Our markets
Reinsurance

transfer and contingent capital to insurance 
companies. The market is dominated by  
large reinsurers in Germany, Switzerland, 
Bermuda, the US and in Lloyd’s. Amlin

Europe. The largest part of Amlin’s reinsurance

of risks which are typically large and complex, 
requiring specialist underwriting expertise and

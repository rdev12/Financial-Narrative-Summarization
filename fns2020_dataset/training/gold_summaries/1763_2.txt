In 2010, we anticipate growth for three of our four operating groups, whilst at Land & Armaments return on sales will
improve as rationalisation and efficiency programmes progress. In aggregate, and despite a planned lower level of
land vehicle activity , the Group continues to expect growth for 2010 based on constant exchange rate assumptions.

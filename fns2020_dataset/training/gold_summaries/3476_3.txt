 2 Christie Group Annual Report 2013
“I am pleased to report our second consecutive
increase in full year operating profit from continuing
operations and before exceptional items of £1.6m
(2012: £1.4m), a 12% increase on the previous year .” 
Our second half performance was encouraging, with a strong
second half operating profit of £1.8m. 
A full year normalised operating profit of £1.6m represents an improved 2.9%
operating profit return (2012: 2.5%) from continuing operations, derived from
revenue of £54.2m (2012: £56.1m). Our second half revenue from continuing
operations was £28.5m (2012: £25.9m), in contrast to £25.7m (2012: £30.2m) in
the six months to June. As we reported in September, we incurred exceptional
costs in the first half of £0.4m (2012: £nil), providing us with a more efficient
business for the remainder of 2013 and beyond.
In November, this progress and dynamism were recognised when Christie
Group were named as one of “1,000 companies to Inspire Britain” in a report
compiled for the London Stock Exchange. This is a pleasing endorsement of
our achievements.
Stock & Inventory Systems & Services
After a start to the year which had seen first half revenue contract year-on-
year, we saw a strong recovery in the second half resulting in full year revenue
of £25.9m, a 1% increase on the previous year (2012: £25.7m). Improvements 
in productivity and efficiency resulted in an impressive 49% improvement in
operating profit to £1.1m (2012: £0.7m). 
Orridge, our retail stocktaking operation, continued its progress in the UK and
Europe, winning new business which included Morrisons, Claire’s Accessories
and Guess. 
On 1 September, we acquired a 75% shareholding in our German stocktaking
franchisee, now operating as Orridge Inventory Services. We are already
encouraged by commitments from new clients for additional business later 
in 2014. 
Our hospitality stocktaking business Venners, operating in both the UK and
Europe, continued its organic growth, illustrated by a 9% increase in the
number of assignments undertaken year-on-year . This success continues to 
be founded on a market-leading offering across a range of services, enabling
us to win new clients in the year such as Arena Leisure, Bowlplex, Merlin Inns,
Lindley Catering and Silverstone. After opening our first branch outside the 
UK, our work in Ireland continues to expand in what is proving a fruitful
territory for us.

“1 ,000 companies to Inspire Britain”: With a strategy and platform for 
growth in our established areas of expertise, an increase in contracted work and
mandated assignments and minimal gearing, we are well placed for the future.

Professional Business Services
We adopted a new regional structure for our transactional
business last April. This has proved effective in making
specialist staff available across all regions of the UK as well
as centrally. Our pipelines of deals in progress finished the
year over 20% stronger than a year ago, providing us with
encouragement as to the volume of transactions we can
look forward to completing in 2014.
Throughout 2013 we were able to demonstrate our ability 
to successfully complete the disposal of prime assets for
prices exceeding expectations, such as the Menzies Hotels
portfolio, The Metropolitan by COMO hotel on Old Park Lane
and the disposal of six high value pubs, including five
freeholds, on behalf of Convivial London Pubs. Each of these
were reported as a recent sales instruction in my Interim
statement. The speed with which Christie + Co completed
the Convivial disposals highlighted the demand for 
freehold pubs, particularly in London. 
Similarly, our corporate teams went into 2014 with more
signed mandates than ever before, which bodes well for 
M&A completions this year .
In Europe, we find the market for privately owned businesses
in France subdued because of the uncertainty regarding the
Capital Gains Tax charges there. Conversely there appears
renewed interest in other Mediterranean countries where
asset prices remain at attractive levels.
For the fourth year in succession, Christie + Co has been
judged the UK’s most active agent in the Leisure and Hotels
category by the Estates Gazette. 
At this time, potentially 19,000 bank swaps mis selling cases
have been identified, of which half have so far been
investigated. Our expectation is of a pick-up in re-banking
applications through Christie Finance following the banks’
payments of compensation. This will, in turn, trigger an
increase in bank-led valuation instructions.
“Orridge, our retail
stocktaking operation,
continued its progress
in the UK and Europe.”

In our first full year following the acquisition in 2012 of
pharmacy specialist Orridge Business Sales, we achieved the
sale of pharmacy businesses at the rate of one per week.
Orridge Business Sales is now fully integrated into Christie + Co.
Outlook
The year started well in the UK for revenue generation where we
currently enjoy a cost base lower than the corresponding period
last year . The continental recovery lags behind the UK and is
uneven but we are seeing encouraging signs in the Germanic
region and parts of the Mediterranean, most notably Spain.
With a strategy and platform for growth in our established
areas of expertise, an increase in contracted work and
mandated assignments and minimal gearing, we are well
placed for the future.
I would like to thank all of my colleagues who worked for our
Group companies last year for their energy and expertise,
applied for the benefit of our clients.
Your board recommend an increased final dividend of 1.0p
per share (2012: 0.5p) for the year in addition to the 0.5p per
share (2012: 0.5p) interim dividend. If approved, the dividend
will be paid on 4 July 2014 to those shareholders on the
register on 6 June 2014.

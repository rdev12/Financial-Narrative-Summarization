Operational and financial review
Historically high production was offset by a weaker gold 
price and we recorded revenues of approximately USD 2.3 
billion versus 2.7 billion in 2012. During the year we pro-
duced USD 422 million of operational cash flow, raised USD 
1,093 million of new debt and invested USD 1,340 million 
in capital construction. At the year-end we had USD 349 
million of net debt.
Dividends
On 31 May 2013 the shareholders approved a final dividend 
in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2012 
of USD 0.0824 per ordinary share and a Special Dividend in re-
spect of the financial year ended 31 December 2012 of USD 
0.0232 per ordinary share, in recognition of the successful 
sale of our gold mining assets in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and 
Romania. The Special Dividend and Final Dividend combined 
represent an aggregate dividend payment of USD 0.1056 per 
ordinary share for 2012. This resulted in a total payment of ap-
proximately USD 320 million, which is around 33% of the Ad-
justed Profit from Continuing Operations for 2012.
During April 2014, the Board will decide whether to propose 
a dividend for the financial year 2013, taking into account 
the Company’s dividend policy, the current market situation 
and financial condition.
Cost control
In the year 2013 the gold price fell 29%. Most companies 
in the sector, including PGIL, undertook cost control measures 
to align their operations with the new market conditions. Pol -
yus’ cost control initiatives were focused in three main areas:
• The Group’s 2013 budget was reviewed and we were 
able to cut selling, general and administrative expenses 
SG&A, operational and capital expenditures. We also 
decreased exploration expenditures in the Krasnoyarsk 
and Irkutsk regions;
• in January 2013, we committed to commence mining 
activities at the Natalka project by the year-end, with 
full commissioning of the mine in summer 2014. Pro-
gress reviews on the Natalka development suggested 
that, whilst this objective might be have been achiev-
able, it also carried the possibility of significant addi-
1 
Year-on-year (y-o-y). Hereinafter means comparing FY2013 with FY2012.
In January 2013, in the Trading Update for the 2012, we commit-
ted to produce 1,590-1,684 k oz in 2013. We met the production 
target thanks to the increased output at the Verninskoye mine 
(y-o-y
1
 increase by 43 k oz) and improved grade and recovery 
at the Olimpiada mine (38 k oz y-o-y increase).

tional expenditure and greater risks, against a backdrop 
of an unfavourable gold price environment. Our strategy 
is not to produce gold at any price and in any condi-
tions. Accordingly, we decided to re-sequence the de-
velopment plan for the Natalka project and postpone 
commissioning of the plant from summer 2014 to sum-
mer 2015 and continue working on optimising capital 
expenditures and operating technology; 
• we developed contingency plans for lower gold price 
scenarios. The plans include a detailed action list, start-
ing with improvements in operational efficiency, reduc-
tions in discretionary capital expenditures and decrease 
in the level of inventories through to measures like clo-
sure of non-efficient enterprises. The contingency plans 
also consider the possibility of hedging at certain gold 
price levels.
Impairments
Following the fall in the gold price in H1 2013, the Company, 
in line with the industry, has reassessed the future prospects 
of its exploration and evaluation (E&E) asset portfolio and has 
also reconsidered the economic recoverability of its mining as-
sets. As a result, based on a long-term gold price assump-
tion of approximately USD 1,350 per oz, the Company has 
recognised non-cash impairment charges of USD 472 million 
in 2013, where USD 49 million is related to the impairment 
of long-term stockpiles and gold-in-process. 
These impairments are indeed disappointing, but thanks 
to the Company’s conservative policy in evaluating reserves 
and projects, the level of impairments was moderate com-
pared to our global peers.
Our good operational results came out of the hard work of the 
Group’s employees over the last few years. On behalf of the 
management, I would like to thank our employees for their 
efforts in delivering this successful performance in 2013.

2.8.2. External market factors affecting 
the Group’s financial results
The Group’s results are affected significantly by movements 
in the price of gold, currency exchange rates (principally 
the Russian rouble/US dollar rate) and the prevailing infla-
tion rates. 
Gold price
The market price of gold is the most significant factor in-
fluencing profitability and operating cash flow. In 2013, the 
gold price was volatile and traded in the range USD 1,694 
per oz to USD 1,192 per oz. Gold opened the year at USD 
1,694 per oz and closed at USD 1,205 per oz, a fall of 29%. 
Average afternoon gold price fixing in the year 
ended 31 December 2013 (USD per oz)
Exchange rate
The Group’s revenue from gold sales is denominated in US 
dollars, but the majority of the Group’s operating expenses 
are denominated in Russian roubles (RUB). Accordingly, 
an appreciation of the Russian rouble against the US dollar 
may negatively affect the Group’s margins, increasing the 
US dollar value of its Russian rouble denominated costs. 
Conversely, an appreciation of the US dollar against the 
Russian rouble should positively affect the Group’s margins 
by decreasing the US dollar value of its rouble-denominated 
costs. In 2013, the USD appreciated by 7.6% against the 
RUB and by a further 10.4% in January – February 2014.
 RUB/USD exchange rate in 2013
Inflation
The Group’s principal operations are located in Russia. The 
increase in Russia’s CPI (Consumer Price Index) in 2013 
was 6.5% (2012: 6.6%), and the increase in the PPI (Pro-
ducer Price Index) was 8.1% (2012: 7%). The last fifteen 
years have seen both indices trending downwards.

In 2013, the Group’s gold sales amounted to USD 2,258,599 
thousand, 14% less than in 2012. The decrease in the value 
of gold sales is largely attributable to the fall in the gold 
price on the world market. At the end of 2013, the Group 
held approximately 34 k oz of refined gold, which were sold 
in January 2014. Thus, in the reporting period, the Group 
produced 1,649 k oz, and sold 1,616 k oz produced in 2013 
and 15 k oz produced in 2012.
Total sales volume in 2013 was 1,631 k oz, against 1,571 
k oz in 2012.
Revenue bridge for the years ended 31 December 
2013 and 2012 (USD million)
In 2013, the weighted-average realised gold price was USD 
1,385 per oz, a 17% decrease on 2012. This was USD 26 
per oz lower than the AAGPF on the London market, be-
cause of the seasonality of production from our alluvial de-
posits, which do not produce and sell gold during the first 
quarter of the year. The AAGPF for the first quarter of 2013 
was higher than the full year AAGPF.

Unrefined gold (doré) for all mines in the Krasnoyarsk business unit is stored in a single unit. Therefore gold sales volumes are bro-
ken down in proportion to refined gold production.
• In 2013, 42% of the Group’s gold sales came from 
the Olimpiada mine.
• In 2013, the Krasnoyarsk business unit sold 1,198 k oz. 
Year-end stocks at the refinery in Krasnoyarsk amount-
ed to 34 k oz, which were sold in 2014.
•  The Olimpiada mine produced 691 k oz of gold and sold 
680 k oz. Expansion of the bio-oxidation facility resulted 
in a higher recovery rate (74.5% vs. 73.7% in 2012) 
and therefore, higher production (up 6%).
• Production at the Titimukhta mine increased by 12% 
y-o-y following a plant upgrade and ore deliveries from 
the third party owned Veduga deposit.
• There was a slight decrease in ore grade at the Blago-
datnoye mine, but this was fully offset by an increase 
in the recovery rate (88.3% vs. 86.4% in 2012), follow-
ing automation of the plant.
• Production at the Verninskoye mine met its design pa-
rameters by the year-end. Following automation, the re-
covery rate increased by 10%. Sales increased by 93% 
compared to 2012.
• Output from the Kuranakh mine was stable  
at 138 k oz.
• Following the depletion of gold grade in sand washed, 
the Alluvials delivered lower volumes of gold.

Cash operating costs
Breakdown of сash operating costs for the years 
ended 31 December 2013 and 2012
Cash operating costs increased from USD 1,127,740 thou-
sand in 2012 to USD 1,267,931 thousand in 2013. This 12% 
increase resulted mainly from increasing costs for consum-
ables and spares, fuel and labour cost inflation.
Consumables and spares
A change of mining plan at the Olimpiada mine resulted in an 
increase of 28% in ore mined and coupled with the continu-
ing ramp-up in production over the year at the Verninskoye 
mine, resulted in an increased consumption of tyres, explo-
sives and spare parts. An increase in gold production at Olim-
piada (+6%), Titimukhta (+12%) and Verninskoye (+95%) 
resulted in higher consumption of cyanide, lubricants, other 
chemicals, grinding balls and spare parts. Market prices for 
some consumables and spares also increased: for example 
the average purchase price for cyanides increased by 10%.
Fuel
Fuel costs grew by 43% to USD 184,226 thousand. This 
increase was as a result of various factors:
• a 5% increase in in-house power generation at the Ol-
impiada diesel power station, to ensure stable power 
supply for the BIOX process;
• the increasing depth of mining at the Olimpiada pit 
which resulted in fuel and vehicle maintenance costs 
rising as distances lengthened;
• a fuel price increase of approximately 9%; 
• increases in consumption of diesel fuel, petrol, oil prod-
ucts and lubricants following an early start to the sea-
son at the alluvials operation.
Labour
In 2013, labour costs made up the largest component 
of cash operating costs. These costs increased by 13% 
to USD 385,781 thousand. The Krasnoyarsk and Irkutsk ore 
business units were the major contributors to this increase:
•  staffing numbers increased and salary increases of be-
tween 10% and 14% were introduced at the Krasno-
yarsk operation to meet the needs of the competitive 
market for labour in the region;
• an 18% increase in the number of personnel at the Vernin-
skoye mine as a result of the continuing ramp-up;
• an increase in the number of personnel at the Com-
pany’s service business units due to the construction 
at Natalka.
Tax on mining
The mining tax charge decreased by 14% to USD 165,573 
thousand. The Group increased production by 5%, however 
this was offset by a 17% fall in the average realised gold price.
Power
Power expenses increased by 15% to USD 57,844 thousand. 
At the Krasnoyarsk business unit, external power consumption 
increased 9% as a result of an increase in ore processed. The 
Irkutsk ore business unit increased external power consump-
tion by 39%, and the Irkutsk alluvial business unit by 10%, 
as a result of connection to the federal grid.

Amortisation and depreciation 
of operating assets
Amortisation and depreciation of operating assets increased 
by 23% in 2013 to USD 209,152 thousand. The increase 
primarily relates to increases in depreciation charges for 
fixed assets at:
• Verninskoye, where the plant was put into operation 
in the second half of 2012 and the ramp-up in produc-
tion continued through 2013;
• Olimpiada, Titimukhta and Kuranakh, where the depre-
ciation of stripping activity asset has increased over the 
period due to higher carried forward balances.
Increase in gold-in-process  
and refined gold
In 2013, the total metal inventories balance increased 
by 61% mainly related to:
• an increase in ore stockpiles at the Krasnoyarsk busi-
ness unit. In the second quarter of 2013, the Group 
changed the mine plan at the Olimpiada deposit to en-
sure the optimisation of equipment use and enhance-
ments to in-pit safety, which resulted in ore stockpiling;
• continued stockpiling of low-grade ore at the Irkutsk ore 
business unit for future processing;
• mining operations started at Natalka in 2013. The stock-
piled ore will be used in production following the com-
mencement of the processing plant;
• a significant amount of refined gold accumulated at the 
Krasnoyarsk refinery plant, which was sold in January 
2014.
Various types of inventories are valued using different ap-
proaches. Refined gold is valued at the average cost of pro-
duction per saleable unit of metal. Work-in-process, stock-
piles and doré are valued at the average production costs 
at the relevant stage of production. For more details, please 
refer to section 2.8.8 “Review of the statement of financial 
position”.
2.8.5. Selling, general and administrative 
expenses (SG&A) (note 9 to the 
consolidated financial statements)
In 2013, the Group’s SG&A expenses decreased by 12% 
to USD 225,795 thousand mainly because taxes, other than 
mining and income taxes, declined by 59%.
Salaries
In 2013, the Group’s administrative labour costs increased 
by 13% to USD 151,027 thousand. 
The increase is mainly related to one-off severance re-
lated payments to former Senior managers of the Group 
and an increase in the number of administrative personnel 
at Verninskoye. 
2.8.6. Finance costs (note 12 to the 
consolidated financial statements)
The total cost of debt increased from 2.8% as at 31 December 
2012 to 4.4% as at 31 December 2013 and relates mainly 
to the 5.625% USD 750 million Notes issued during 2013. 
However, interest expenses accrued on the Notes and let-
ters of credit were capitalised within the Mine under devel-
opment balance, recognising the use of the proceeds for 
the Natalka project development. Therefore, the Group’s 
finance costs decreased by 56% in 2013 to USD 13,878 
thousand and cost of debt, net of interest capitalised, de-
creased from 2.8% to 2.7%.

as a result of the disposal of the mining assets in Kazakh-
stan and Kyrgyzstan with a net book value of USD 261,150 
thousand. The decrease in net book value on account of the 
sale was offset by transfers from capital construction-in-
progress due to: 
• completion of construction of the full flow-sheet at the 
Verninskoye mine and associated infrastructure, valued 
at USD 140,410 thousand;
• completion of various projects at the Krasnoyarsk busi-
ness valued at USD 109,748 thousand, including au-
tomation of the processing plant at Blagodatnoye and 
mill throughput expansion at Titimukhta. In addition, 
housing for 570 staff was commissioned at Olimpiada, 
replacing old facilities.

In 2013, additions to CIP were mainly driven by the following:
• a number of projects at the Krasnoyarsk business unit, 
including automation of two processing plants at Olim-
piada and one at Titimukhta, valued at USD 209,813 
thousand;
• development of infrastructure at Verninskoye valued 
at USD 53,253 thousand;
• increase of activities of the Capital construction BU at 
Natalka (USD 37,280 thousand), and
• the start of construction of the Peleduy – Mamakan pow-
er line (USD 30,949 thousand).
Mine under development (note 17 to the 
consolidated financial statements)
Mine under development includes only the Natalka mine (Magadan 
business unit). For details see section 2.9.3 “Development” .
Exploration and evaluation assets 
(note 18 to the consolidated financial 
statements)
In 2013, the Group invested USD 32,652 thousand into 
exploration and reserves evaluation activities, some 28% 
less than in 2012. This decrease relates to a slowdown and 
termination of exploration activity:
• at Nezhdaninskoye, Degdekanskoye and some other 
unpromising deposits, which are not expected to be 
economically viable at current gold prices, and which 
were therefore impaired at 30 June 2013 (for details 
see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements); 
• at Panimba, Medvezhy Zapadny and other deposits 
where exploration work has ceased because the depos-
its are in the final stage of reserve evaluation.

Exploration and evaluation expenditures are capitalised 
when the exploration and evaluation activities have not 
reached a stage that permits a reasonable assessment 
of the existence of commercially recoverable gold resourc-
es. When the technical feasibility and commercial viability 
of extracting a gold resource are demonstrable and a deci-
sion has been made to develop a mine, capitalised explora-
tion and evaluation assets are reclassified to Mines under 
development. 
At the end of the year, exploration and evaluation assets 
decreased by 66%. Expenditures of USD 32,652 thou-
sand were offset by impairment of USD 316,468 thousand 
(see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements) and 
by disposal of subsidiaries (see notes 5.2 and 18 to the

This increase is represented by: 
• the rise in ore stockpiles at the Krasnoyarsk business 
unit. In Q2 2013, the Group reviewed the mine plan 
at the Olimpiada deposit in an effort to optimise equip-
ment utilisation and enhance in-pit safety. These chang-
es have resulted in an increase in stockpiled ore, which 
will be processed during 2014 and thereafter;
• mining of low-grade ore at the Irkutsk ore business unit, 
which is stockpiled for future processing;
• in 2013, 4.1 million tonnes of ore were mined for stock-
piling at Natalka, including 947 thousand tonnes at 2.0 
g/t, 1,498 thousand tonnes of ore at 1.0 g/t and 1,668 
thousand tonnes at 0.6 g/t;
• a significant amount of refined gold was accumulated 
at the Krasnoyarsk refinery plant totalling 34 k oz (2012: 
15 k oz), which the Group sold in January 2014. 
The value of stores and materials increased by 6%, from 
USD 449,767 thousand at the beginning of the year to USD 
476,366 thousand as at 31 December 2013, mainly due to:
• an increase in consumption at the Verninskoye mine;
• the Krasnoyarsk business unit which increased con-
sumption of fuel because of increased haulage costs 
following the change of the mining plan at Olimpiada 
and the works to enlarge the pit.
Capital and reserves (note 25 to the 
consolidated financial statements) 
The translation reserve has moved by USD 318,634 thou-
sand in 2013, which reflected the weakening of the Russian 
rouble. 
During the reporting period, the Group’s retained earnings 
decreased by 9% to USD 1,922,264 thousand, due to a de-
crease in net profit attributable to shareholders of the par-
ent Company of USD 140,274 thousand and USD 320,195 
thousand in dividends declared and paid in respect of 2012. 
Borrowings (note 27 to the consolidated 
financial statements) 
During the year, the Company raised USD 1,092,617 thou-
sand in new debt and repaid USD 236,233 thousand. Please 
refer to section 2.8.9 “Cash flow analysis”, for details.
As at 31 December 2013, the Group’s consolidated debt 
was USD 1,205,586 thousand. The structure of the debt 
at year-end was as follows.

Net cash/(debt) is defined as short-term and long-term 
debt less cash and cash equivalents and short-term bank 
deposits. Short-term bank deposits with an original matu-
rity of more than 3 months can be withdrawn on demand 
and therefore have the same liquidity as cash and cash 
equivalents. Net debt should not be considered as an alter-
native to current and non-current loans and borrowings and 
should not necessarily be construed as a comprehensive 
indicator of the Group’s measure of liquidity.

Operating activities
The decrease in cash inflow from operating activities resulted from a combination of factors, mainly the declining gold 
price and the increased working capital requirements due to growth in inventory balances at Verninskoye and Olimpiada.

Investing activities
The Group spent USD 1,023,381 thousand (2012: USD 
763,789 thousand) in investing activities. 
In 2013, purchases of capital construction-in-progress, ex-
ploration and evaluation assets and assets for mine under 
development totalled USD 1,347,217 thousand (2012: USD 
713,089 thousand). The Group raised USD 291,199 thou-
sand from the disposal of its subsidiaries in Kazakhstan.
Financing activities 
The Group raised USD 744,241 thousand from the issue 
of Notes due in 2020 (USD 750 million net of up front com-
mission), and USD 348,375 thousand from issued letters 
of credit and credit facilities from VTB Bank, Rosbank and 
Deutsche Bank. The Group paid out USD 363,162 thousand 
in dividends and USD 236,233 thousand to repay borrow-
ings. This resulted in a net cash inflow from financing activi-
ties of USD 493,222 thousand.
2.8.10. Adjusted EBITDA
Adjusted EBITDA is defined by the Group as profit before fi-
nance costs, income tax, income/(losses) from investments, 
depreciation, amortisation and interest, and is further adjust-
ed for certain items included in the table below. The Group 
has made these adjustments in calculating Adjusted EBITDA 
to provide a clearer view of the performance of its underly-
ing business operations and to generate a metric that it be-
lieves will give greater comparability over time with peers 
in its industry. The Group believes that Adjusted EBITDA  
is a meaningful indicator of its profitability and performance. 
This measure should not be considered as an alterna-
tive to profit for the year and operating cash flows based 
on IFRS and should not necessarily be construed as a com-
prehensive indicator of the Group’s measure of profitability.

In 2013, the TCC per oz sold increased by 1%. The key driver was an increase in the cost of gold sales by 6% (for more details, 
please refer to section 2.8.4 “Cost of gold sales”) partly offset by the appreciation of the US dollar against the Russian rouble. 
The aggregate Adjusted EBITDA of the Group’s principal rev-
enue generating business units is USD 917,932 thousand and 
including the results of the other companies of the Group 
gives a Group Adjusted EBITDA of USD 910,076 thousand.
2.8.11. Total cash costs per oz sold
The Group believes that the metrics total cash costs (TCC) 
and total cash costs per oz sold, although non-IFRS meas-
ures, provide a useful comparison with other industry players.  
Its use is common industry practice, although the method 
of its calculation may differ as these items are non-IFRS meas-
ures. An investor should not consider these items in isolation 
or as alternatives to the cost of sales, profit for the year at-
tributable to shareholders of the parent Company, net cash 
generated from operating activities or any other measure of fi-
nancial performance presented in accordance with IFRS.
Total cash costs per oz sold is total cash costs divided 
by ounces of gold sold during the period.

Non-monetary changes in inventories is a calculation to estimate the non-cash portion of costs included in the change in the amount 
of inventory, primarily representing depreciation and amortisation. Polyus Gold International / Annual report / 2013

Back to the contents
TCC per oz sold by mine in the years ended 31 December 2013 and 2012, USD per oz
•  Olimpiada mine: a 3% y-o-y decrease in TCC per ounce 
of gold sold as a result of an improvement in average 
grade and recovery;
• Blagodatnoye mine: a slight increase in TCC of 3% y-o-y 
from a lower grade of ore processed, offset by the im-
proved recovery rate;
• Titimukhta mine: an improvement of the recovery rate 
following installation of a new thickener and the expan-
sion of the hydro-metallurgical section, offset by a 12% 
decrease in gold grade;
• Verninskoye: a 10% increase in TCC as a result 
of a combination of an increase in consumption of vari-
ous mining and processing materials (ore mining vol-
umes increased), growth in the number of personnel 
and increased prices for goods purchased;
• Alluvials: a 5% decrease in TCC due to ongoing optimisa-
tion of the mining plan and a 6% decrease in personnel;
• Kuranakh: an increased zinc content in the ore fed to the 
plant significantly reduced the recovery rate. This metal-
lurgical issue, together with an increase in cash operat-
ing costs resulted in a 9% increase in TCC.
2.8.12. All-in sustaining cash  
costs per oz sold
In June 2013, the World Gold Council (WGC) published 
a guidance note on the all-in sustaining cash costs (AISC) 
metric for gold mining companies. It is expected that the 
adoption of AISC by precious metal producers may help 
to provide investors, governments, local communities and 
other stakeholders with better visibility into the true cost 
of producing gold.
AISC measures costs related to sustaining production
1
. 
We calculate it in accordance with the recommendation 
of the WGC including TCC, SG&A expenses, sustaining CAPEX 
and other cash costs attributable to current sales. 
In 2013, AISC for the Company was USD 1,002 per oz sold, 
which is 1% lower than in 2012 (USD 1,007 per oz sold). The 
main reasons for the decrease are explained by a 2% fall 
of the Russian rouble against the US dollar, 61% lower strip-
ping activity asset additions, and a 12% reduction in SG&A 
expenses partly offset by overall inflation in the cost of sales 
and a 31% increase in sustaining CAPEX.

Non-sustaining costs are those costs incurred at new operations and costs related to ‘major projects’ at existing operations where 
these projects will materially increase production. Companies need to publicly disclose those operations and ‘major projects’ which 
are considered non-sustaining. All other costs related to existing operations are considered sustaining.

GLOBAL PRESENCE
IG is a global leader in online trading and currently the No.1 
provider of CFDs and financial spread betting worldwide.
(1)
 
Initially established in the UK, we began our global expansion  
by entering Australia in 2002. Since then we have opened  
offices in a further 14 countries around the world and now serve 
clients in over 140 countries. Our headquarters are located in the  
City of London.
A SINGLE WORLDWIDE IDENTITY
Late in 2012 we took the important step of unifying our 
retail brands, with the exception of Nadex, under the single 
identity of IG. This ensures worldwide consistency across 
all our platforms and is a better representation of the scale 
of our offering. We acquired a number of domain names, 
including IG.com and a range of local country IG domains, 
and enabled clients to access multiple accounts, products 
and platforms from a single login. We have now migrated 
all of our websites to IG.com. Over time, we expect this to 
enhance our search engine rankings and to increase our 
buying power for paid search, ultimately improving our 
client acquisition rates. As we begin to broaden our  
product set to appeal to a wider range of active traders,  
we believe that our single identity will raise awareness of  
IG and our products and become a valuable client  
recruitment resource.

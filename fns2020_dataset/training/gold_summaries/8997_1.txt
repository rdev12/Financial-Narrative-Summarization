KBC ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REPORT
THE REFINER’S CHALLENGE
2006 saw continued volatility in crude oil prices 
and reﬁning margins, with oil prices peaking 
at over US$70 per barrel during the summer, 
before falling back by around 25% by the end 
of the year. This fall in prices was driven by the 
short-term effects of stockpiling and a mild 
northern hemisphere winter, with the long-term 
trend expected to remain positive during 2007. 
Economic growth is forecast to be robust in 2007, 
albeit with regional variations. Hence we believe 
that 2007 will be another good year for reﬁners 
with margins remaining buoyant as inventory 
levels fall and growth in demand continues.
In this environment we anticipate that strong 
reﬁning margins will continue to drive the growth 
of both new and revamp projects as reﬁners 
increase or protect market share. Over the next 
two to three years, as new reﬁning capacity comes 
on stream, we expect to see the current shortage 
in capacity reduce and current high reﬁning 
margins decline to lower levels.

REFINERY CAPACITY VS OIL DEMAND
_0_KBC_ar06_front.indd   6 29/03/2007   12:26:31 OpX: OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE  
PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION
ST CROIX, USVI
HOVENSA, LLC (HOVENSA) has appointed TTS Performance 
Systems, Inc., KBC’s Human Performance Improvement 
division, to assist them in becoming a Production-Centered 
Organisation (PCO) through the implementation of a 
full-scale Operational Excellence (OpX) programme across 
the entire reﬁnery. We are currently working with HOVENSA 
management and staff on all aspects of this organisational 
change from conceptual design and strategy development, 
programme management and design of speciﬁc systems, 
through to point-of-manufacture implementation.
_0_KBC_ar06_tipins.indd   1 29/03/2007   12:27:01 One key element of this change is to increase the 
organisation’s investment in its human assets and upgrade 
its approach to training, performance management, and 
performance support. As part of this effort, HOVENSA had 
engaged TTS in April 2005 to assess its operations practices 
and behaviours against industry best practices. To address 
the assessment ﬁndings and continue its move towards 
becoming a PCO, HOVENSA asked us to assist in the 
development and implementation of the next phase of the 
performance improvement process. 
Three high-priority areas were identiﬁed for initial focus:
  Reﬁnery Operating Vision, Philosophy, and Improvement 
Strategies
 Job Performance Proﬁle Development
 Training System Design and Development
REFINERY OPERATING VISION, PHILOSOPHY AND 
IMPROVEMENT STRATEGIES
KBC and TTS consultants worked with the reﬁnery leadership 
team to facilitate the design of a reﬁnery operating philosophy, 
in alignment with the reﬁnery’s vision. This will assist in 
the transition to becoming a PCO. In addition, we have 
assisted in deﬁning key improvement strategies and 
tactical improvement plans. 
JOB PERFORMANCE PROFILE DEVELOPMENT
Job performance proﬁles are currently being developed for 
all point-of-manufacturing positions based on the reﬁnery’s 
operating vision and philosophy. The proﬁles will provide the 
basis for the redesign of point-of-manufacturing training 
and an ongoing performance management initiative.
TRAINING SYSTEM DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
The Training System Design will provide the structure for 
managing the training function and will identify the course 
curriculum for the identiﬁed Operations positions. The 
design is formally captured in the Training System Design 
Document, which consists of two sections: Training 
Management Guide and a Training Master Plan. 
While assisting HOVENSA in preparing for the future, we 
have provided ongoing training development and 
deployment for HOVENSA’s Low Sulfur Gasoline project as 
well as training for reﬁnery operations. This includes: Process 
Systems, Equipment Care and Condition Monitoring, Process 
Control, Abnormal Situations Management, and Training 
of Trainers.
TTS and HOVENSA personnel will work collaboratively over 
the next few years to design, develop, and implement targeted, 
holistic improvement projects in pursuit of the achievement 
of OpX. Examples of key OpX implementation activities that 
will be completed over the next several years are:
  Operator and Maintenance Training Programme 
Development and Delivery
 On-going Organisational Alignment Activities

07
KBC ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006
Whilst refiners will continue to face the 
challenge of operating their facilities in a safe 
and environmentally acceptable way, it is the 
increase in capital project related work that will 
present them with signiﬁ cant issues in 2007. 
The industry continues to suffer from a skills 
shortage. Engineering professionals are currently 
in demand but the focus is likely to shift to 
operations staff over the next few years as 
new plants come on stream.
KBC’S RESPONSE
A core element of KBC’s strategy during 
the turnaround in our business has been to 
align our services and products to changing 
market requirements. 
  In the new investment segment, a programme 
supporting both owners and operators was 
launched: Capital Excellence (“CapX”). This 
service covers strategy, market analysis, 
reﬁ nery conﬁ guration studies, design and 
project management support from concept 
through to start-up. We have entered into 
several relationships with both engineering 
and operating companies, including Fluor 
and SK Corporation. More than half the 
process engineering work carried out in 
the UK in 2006 was related to CapX 
programmes for our clients.
  KBC has offered services related to plant 
operations for many years. The acquisition 
of TTS in February 2006, however, provided 
us with a framework to match our services 
with clients’ operational needs. Operational 
Excellence (“OpX”) is a programme that helps 
clients to ensure that their facilities are 
operated in a safe, environmentally acceptable 
and proﬁ table manner. The service covers 
planning and scheduling, reliability and 
maintenance, safety, health and environment, 
leadership, human performance and continuous 
improvement. During 2006 our R&D efforts 
included the documentation of best practice 
in this area. In 2007 we anticipate a growing 
need for this service as clients strive to meet 
increasing operational challenges driven by 
tightening of safety and environmental 
standards and capacity expansion.
To help ensure an agile response to client needs, we 
have consolidated and simpliﬁ ed our organisational 
structure. At each of our main operational centres 
in London, Houston and Singapore, the senior 
management team comprises the head of 
Operations and the head of Business Development. 
The three regions operate on a semi autonomous 
basis to ensure they are responsive to local market 
developments. The Executive Committee, which 
includes these regional executives, together with 
other senior managers and the Executive Directors, 
ensures that common standards are applied and 
optimises the use of resources across all regions.
SALES
Contract awards in 2006 amounted to £35.4m, 
an increase of 10% over 2005. The Europe, 
Middle East and Africa region returned it’s 
strongest ever performance with sales of 
£14.1m. Sales in the Americas were healthy 
at £11.6m, with particularly strong demand in 
Central America. Sales awards in Asia of £9.7m 
showed a satisfactory increase on the underlying 
2005 ﬁ gure, excluding the effect of the £6.5m 
Sinopec contract awarded in 2005. Key contracts 
awarded include:
   Multi year Technical Services alliance 
with PETRONAS
  Reﬁ nery Reconﬁ guration/Clean Fuel Studies 
for ﬁ ve PEMEX reﬁ neries
  Multi year Technical Services alliance 
with Nerefco
  Central America Grass Roots Reﬁ nery Study 
for the Inter-American Development Bank
  Development of operating procedure manuals 
for Valero Reﬁ ning Company in the US
Since the year-end, the Group has been awarded 
an extension of its Technical Services contract 
with Irving Oil.

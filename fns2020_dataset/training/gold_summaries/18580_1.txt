Chief Executive’s Review
Karim Bitar
Genus achieved very good progress in 2015, 
with the benefit of many of the strategic 
changes that have been made over the last 
few years contributing towards the strong 
operational performance overall. We continued 
to step up the pace of genetic improvement 
and achieved encouraging progress in our R&D 
initiatives, which bodes well for the future  
as we become an increasingly science and 
intellectual property based company. The 
acquisition of 51% of IVB will also enable us to 
provide innovative new genetic solutions to our 
customers in the dairy and beef industries. 
Group Performance
Genus’s overall performance was 
strong in 2015. Revenues grew 7% 
to £398m, on volume growth of 6% 
in porcine and 6% in dairy and beef. 
Adjusted profit before tax, including 
joint ventures (‘JVs’), was up 19% 
to £46.6m and growth in constant 
currency was even stronger at 23%.
PIC had an outstanding year, with 
17% operating profit growth including 
JVs in constant currency. This was 
driven by an excellent performance 
in the Americas, with the completion 
of Génétiporc’s integration and 
the addition of Birchwood both 
contributing. We also saw a 
recovery in the porcine industry, 
as the impact of porcine epidemic 
diarrhoea virus (‘PEDv’) waned.  Genus plc Annual Report 2015

INFORMATION
“ Genus’s overall performance 
was very strong in 2015.”
Performance in ABS and Asia was 
more mixed, with both businesses 
delivering stable profits in constant 
currency compared with the prior year. 
ABS’s sales performance was positive 
in all regions despite weakening 
conditions in global dairy markets 
but higher product costs held back 
overall profits. Our strategic actions 
in ABS to increase differentiation 
through breeding our own bulls, 
developing proprietary indices and 
new technologies, such as IVF and 
GSS, all made good progress. 
Our Asian operations continued to 
face challenging conditions in porcine 
markets, with Chinese producers 
making losses through most of the 
year. Russia was also affected by weak 
markets and closure of the border to 
imports. Conditions in both of these 
markets appear more encouraging 
as we enter the new financial year.
Strategy
Our innovation strategy starts with 
R&D. We continued to implement 
advances in selection techniques 
that are significantly accelerating 
genetic gains in our porcine nucleus 
herds. These new genetics are now 
working their way through our 
supply chain, and customers will 
start to benefit from them during 
2016 and 2017. We also applied 
these approaches in bovine, as we 
developed proprietary indices and 
pursued our breeding programme 
in the dairy and beef nucleus herds 
we initiated in 2014. Some of the elite 
young sires from this programme 
will enter production in 2016. 
Our leading-edge research 
programmes in the areas of disease 
resistance and genetic dissemination 
technology passed several 
scientifically significant milestones, 
although these projects remain 
long-term in nature. In addition, we 
continued to make good progress 
with the technical milestones on 
GSS and are vigorously pursuing 
our anti-trust litigation in the US to 
seek to create an open market for 
our technology. The trial date has 
now been set for 1 August 2016.
In March, we acquired 51% of IVB, the 
world’s leading supplier of bovine IVF 
services. Combining IVB’s skills with 
ABS’s leading genetic management 
tools will enable us to accelerate 
the genetic improvement of our 
customers’ herds and opens up 
new opportunities. During the year, 
IVB introduced a novel method of 
producing frozen embryos which 
makes their implantation significantly 
easier. Our initial integration of the 
business is progressing well. 
We generate value for our genetics by 
targeting key markets and segments 
and tailoring our business model to 
the needs of our customers in these 
markets. PIC increased its market 
share and grew penetration of the 
royalty model, particularly in Europe 
and Asia. Génétiporc was fully 
integrated a year ahead of schedule 
and we are very pleased with the 
results in North America and Latin 
America. We also acquired Birchwood, 
a boar stud operation serving mid-
sized customers in North America, to 
strengthen our distribution of male 
genetics in this segment. Its results 
are consistent with our expectations.
In China, we continued to adapt 
our business model to reduce 
financial investment and exposure 
to the volatile farming market, 
exiting two owned farms and 
completing the stocking of our first 
third-party multiplier, Riverstone, 
during the year. Riverstone, which 
is also a royalty-based customer, 
will stock a second farm in 2016. 
We gave more details of our strategy 
and our progress with its execution  
at a Capital Markets Day we hosted  
in London in May 2015. A webcast  
of the event is available at 
www.genusplc.com.
Our People
GELT was unchanged in 2015 and I 
am very pleased with the Group’s high 
energy, individual capabilities and 
collective teamwork. It is a privilege 
to work with such a strong team. 
During the year, we strengthened 
further our people management 
practices, training and talent 
development, and increased our 
emphasis on the health and safety 
of employees. Our employee pulse 
survey showed that our employees 
have a very significant commitment 
to our vision, values and strategy. 
Their passion and engagement 
makes a big contribution to the 
value we deliver to our customers 
and our success in the market. 
Outlook
In 2015, we significantly exceeded our 
target double-digit compound annual 
growth in adjusted operating profit 
in constant currency. Our constant 
currency growth rate in 2016, while 
in line with expectations, is expected 
to be more moderate. Based on 
current conditions, we are cautiously 
optimistic about improved results in 
Asia. However, we remain cautious 
about prospects in dairy, where market 
conditions are very tough for our 
customers, and porcine commodity 
prices have worsened compared 
with last year. The sharp depreciation 
of the Euro, Rouble and most Latin 
American currencies over the last year 
will also be a continuing headwind.

Market Opportunities
The Animal Genetics Market
Consumers around the world are increasingly demanding safe, 
affordable and high-quality animal protein. At the same time, 
farmers are striving to produce animal protein more efficiently, 
in part because of increasing competition for finite resources. 
Genetics are critical to addressing these challenges.
1. Growing demands for 
animal protein
The global population continues to 
grow and is becoming increasingly 
urbanised. These demographic 
shifts mean much of the increase 
in demand is coming from 
emerging markets, in regions such 
as Asia and Latin America.

As consumers move from an 
agricultural to an urban lifestyle, 
they tend to become wealthier. 
This in turn leads to an increasing 
demand for animal protein, as 
meat and dairy products become 
a larger part of people’s diets.
2. Supply constraints
At the same time as demand is 
rising, production is becoming more 
challenging. Competition for resources 
such as water and land for producing 
animal protein is intensifying. 
Increasingly volatile and unpredictable 
weather patterns can also significantly 
affect crop harvests and hence the 
availability and cost of animal feed. 
This puts pressure on producers 
to be as efficient as possible.
3. Shorter, simpler  
supply chains
Supply chains that were previously 
fragmented, with multiple steps 
between food producers and 
consumers, are becoming shorter 
and transparency is increasing. 
The result is that consumer needs 
are having a more direct influence 
on food producers. This is driving 
demand for higher-quality animal 
protein and less use of drugs.
4. Changes in production
In response to all these issues, 
food producers are increasingly 
turning to high-quality genetics to 
increase production and efficiency. 
For example, artificial insemination 
(‘AI’) in dairy has reached 75% in 
the US and 50% in India. There is 
scope for considerable growth 
in markets such as Brazil, where 
AI is used in just 13% of herds.
The scale of production is also 
increasing, as producers focus on 
efficiency and look to consolidate 
and vertically integrate, leading 
to a greater proportion of animal 
protein being delivered by larger, 
more technified producers globally. 
For example, in porcine, large scale 
integrated pork production accounts 
for the majority of pork production 
in the US and Brazil, and is a growing 
proportion of production in China.

Genus PIC and Genus ABS operate 
in markets with different dynamics.
The global porcine sector is 
consolidated and technified in many 
of our key markets, with strong 
representation of large integrated pork 
producers. Such producers are more 
able to measure and realise the direct 
benefits of genetic improvement and 
often rely on head-to-head validation 
trials to select their preferred supplier 
of genetics. These genetics are 
supplied from proprietary animal lines 
and purchased on multi-year genetic 
improvement contracts, with payment 
tied to the resulting improvement in 
the customer’s breeding herd. The net 
result is a market with differentiated 
products and high barriers to entry.
In dairy and beef, the global market 
is much more fragmented and 
customers are typically less technified. 
Products and their genetic merit 
have historically been benchmarked 
to public indices and all breeders’ 
genetics are typically sold in an open 
market system, with no restrictions on 
further genetic dissemination through 
the resale of genetic offspring. Barriers 
to entry are therefore lower and 
products are priced on a transactional 
basis. However, both the dairy and 
beef industry are seeing an increasing 
trend towards technification, with 
some of the leading dairy and 
beef producers looking to invest in 
bilateral partnerships with genetic 
suppliers to improve their productivity 
and the quality of their herds.

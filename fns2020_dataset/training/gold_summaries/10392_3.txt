and Accounts 2010
Another excellent 
performance
We are delighted to report that MITIE  
has made excellent progress in the past 
financial year. We have significantly 
enhanced our capabilities through 
selective investments in our energy  
and FM business propositions, as well as 
through strategic acquisitions. We have 
delivered double digit growth in revenue, 
underlying earnings and dividends. In the 
year, revenue increased by 13.0% to 
£1,720.1m and underlying operating profit 
before other items (non-cash or non-
recurring acquisition related items) by 
15.5% to £93.0m, while cash conversion 
remained extremely strong at 95.2%.  
This is an excellent performance against  
a backdrop of challenging economic 
conditions and is a testament to the 
passion and hard work of the MITIE team. 
Strategy
Our strategy is to deliver stakeholder value 
through a focus on sustainable profitable 
growth; we are delivering against that 
strategy and have ambitious plans for the 
future. MITIE has proven capabilities as a 
strategic outsourcing company that adds 
value to its clients. Today’s low carbon 
economy means that our clients are 
looking for something different. They want 
to deal with a business that can create 
an innovative outsourcing solution as 
well as providing integrated facilities 
management and specialist services. 
This market trend is creating significant 
opportunities to grow our market share 
particularly in technical, facilities and 
energy management. The execution of our 
strategy is enabled by the development of 
our talented and innovative people, our 
technology and infrastructure platform 
and through our continued investment in 
our ability to manage contracts that are 
increasingly large and complex.
During the year we have made two  
key strategic acquisitions which have 
broadened our capabilities and 
significantly strengthened our client 
proposition. In August 2009 , we acquired 
Dalkia FM for a total consideration 
(including costs) of £1 19 .5m. This acquisition 
complemented our existing engineering 
maintenance capabilities and specifically 
enhanced our carbon, energy 
management and energy efficient 
lighting credentials. We have integrated 
the business with our engineering 
maintenance business and the enlarged 
business is now operating successfully as 
MITIE Technical Facilities Management.  
In November 2009 , we acquired 
Environmental Property Services Limited 
(EPS Ltd) for maximum total consideration 
of £40.9m (including costs). EPS Ltd was 
integrated with our social housing business 
within our Property Management division 
and significantly enhances our capability 
in the social housing market, particularly in 
the South East of England. The Dalkia FM 
and EPS Ltd acquisitions have been 
successfully integrated, have delivered 
earnings in line with our expectations and 
we are confident they will make a significant 
contribution to MITIE’s future growth.
Results
The year saw revenues grow by 13.0%  
to £1,720.1m (2009: £1,521.9m), with a 
particularly good performance in our 
Facilities Management (FM) division.  
We also saw a significant contribution to 
revenue of £190.1m from the acquisitions 
made during the year. 
Operating profit before other items 
increased by 15.5% to £93.0m (2009: 
£80.5m), reflecting an enhanced margin 
of 5.4% (2009: 5.3%). Profit before tax and 
other items increased by 1 7 .0% to £91.7m 
(2009: £78.4m). Earnings per share before 
other items grew by 13.4% to 19 .5p per 
share (2009: 17 .2p per share).

The business remains very cash generative 
and has reported a cash inflow from 
operations of £98.4m (2009: £94.4m) for  
the year, representing excellent cash 
conversion of 95.2% (2009: 97 .5%). The 
balance sheet is extremely strong with net 
debt at the year end at 0.84x EBITDA at 
£86.6m (2009: net cash £10.9m), after using 
debt funding of £1 16.1m for acquisitions. 
Committed bank facilities of £230.0m 
remain in place to January 2012 which 
leaves the Group well positioned to  
take advantage of further acquisition 
opportunities as they arise. 
Our order book is strong. It grew by 30.6% 
during the year, and now stands at a 
record £6.4bn (2009: £4.9bn). Our sales 
pipeline is also at record levels and our 
contracted revenue for the year ending 
31 March 201 1 stands at 75% of budgeted 
revenue (2009: 7 4%). 
Dividend
MITIE continues to generate attractive 
dividends and dividend growth for its 
shareholders. The Board is recommending 
an increased final dividend of 4.1p per 
Ordinary share, providing a total dividend 
per share for the year of 7 .8p, a 13.0% 
increase on 2009 in line with our dividend 
policy to maintain dividends in line with 
underlying earnings per share growth at a 
cover ratio of 2.5 times adjusted earnings. 
Subject to shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting, the dividend will 
be paid on 13 August 2010 to shareholders 
on the register at 25 June 2010.
Board
We were pleased to welcome two new 
Non-Executive Directors to the Board 
during the year. Terry Morgan CBE,  
joined the Board on 1 July 2009 and  
has been appointed Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee and Larry Hirst 
CBE, joined on 1 February 2010. Both have 
considerable commercial experience  
of large complex organisations: Larry’s 
career with IBM has spanned 32 years 
where he held the role of Chief Executive 
UK & Ireland and is currently a Chairman 
of IBM EMEA; Terry is the Chairman of and 
has had extensive experience working  
for Crossrail. We look forward to the 
contributions they will make to the 
development of MITIE in the future. 
Ishbel Macpherson stepped down as a 
Non-Executive Director on 30 September 
2009 having served for four years on our 
Board. We wish Ishbel well for the future.
People
MITIE is one of the UK’s largest private 
sector employers. During the year, the 
number of people employed by MITIE rose 
by 5,093 to 56,579 . We would like to thank 
all of our people for their exceptional 
efforts and support and to welcome all 
those who have joined MITIE during the 
year. In particular, we would like to extend 
a warm welcome to all those joining the 
Group from both Dalkia FM and EPS Ltd. 
The Board realises that results as good  
as these are only produced by talented 
people dedicated to achieving the same 
strategic goals. 
Our future progress will be heavily 
influenced by our ability to maintain the 
motivation and drive of all MITIE people. 
We will be reinforcing MITIE’s ethos of 
recognising and rewarding exceptional 
team performance, nurturing talent and 
providing opportunities for our people to 
succeed in their careers.
Outlook
MITIE is in a very strong position. We have 
seen a step-change in our capabilities 
driven by selective investment in 
technology, in our energy and FM 
propositions as well as through strategic 
acquisitions. Furthermore, our developing 
international strategy will enable us to 
extend our reach and exploit growth 
opportunities both in the UK and overseas.
Our prospects for growth are very strong 
and we will benefit from the full year  
effect of both the Dalkia FM and EPS Ltd 
acquisitions in this year’s results, along with 
the related synergies. 
Demand for innovation and efficiencies  
in both the public and private sectors  
will provide great opportunities for MITIE.  
We maintain a position of financial 
strength, a robust balance sheet and 
capacity for further organic and 
acquisitive growth. We are positive about 
MITIE’s future and of continuing to deliver 
sustainable profitable growth.

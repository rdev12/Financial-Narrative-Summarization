Overview
In tough market conditions, the business 
delivered a good performance. For 
the year to 30 June 2012, the Group 
increased revenues to £67.96m (2011: 
£52.80m) and adjusted profit before 
tax
*1
 rose to £10.02m (2011: £8.68m). 
Existing customers delivered contracted 
recurring revenue of £33.74m (2011: 
£24.18m), accounting for 50% of total 
income and up 40% on last year. This 
revenue continues to provide a good 
underpinning to K3’s earnings. A further 
39% of income came from existing 
customers through the sale of additional 
services or products, demonstrating 
the value of the customer base we 
have built over the past several years. 
The five significant acquisitions we 
made in the year also appreciably 
benefited K3’s results, contributing a 
combined £11.82m to revenues and 
£2.18m to adjusted operating profit
*2
. 
Our acquisitions have now all been 
integrated into our operations and are 
performing in line with our expectations. 
They broaden our technical skills and 
add new Intellectual Property (“IP”) as 
well as increase our base of long term 
contracted customers. 
Given market conditions, the level of major 
contract wins which the Group secured 
over the year was encouraging although 
deal slippage continued to be a feature 
of the trading environment. We closed a 
total of £13.3m of major contracts during 
the year (2011: £11.10m), the full benefits 
of which are still to come. Notable new 
customer deals included Easons, Oxfam, 
Phoenix, Grafton, Scotiabank (Canada)  
and Wynsors.
Across the Group, the performance of 
our four trading Divisions, Microsoft UK, 
SYSPRO and Sage, International and 
Managed Services, has been varied. 
Revenue contribution from all four 
Divisions is up but difficult conditions in 
the UK combined with our investment 
programme in our Microsoft AX product 
suite impacted the adjusted profit 
contribution from our Microsoft UK 
Division. Against this, the performance 
of the International Division was 
especially strong, helped by increased 
activity with Inter IKEA Systems BV 
(the owner and franchisor of the IKEA 
concept and the largest customer in the 
Group). The SYSPRO and Sage Division 
performed robustly and continued 
to generate high levels of recurring 
income. Managed Services’ performance 
has continued to improve with 
encouraging new business wins in the 
final quarter. Managed Services Division 
is still at an early stage of development 
but has significant growth potential. In 
the first half of the year, we invested in 
enhancing the Division’s platform and 
delivery capability and consequently 
slowed our intake of hosting business. 
However, with this phase of the 
investment now completed, the 
level of new deployments in the 
final quarter has been encouraging, 
including Scotiabank, a major new 
SYSPRO contract in Canada and the first 
agreement to result from our global 
collaboration with SYSPRO.
The Group’s profitability continues to 
benefit from our strategy of developing 
our own library of IP and this year we 
invested £1.91m in IP development. By 
enhancing the core business software 
products (Microsoft, SYSPRO and Sage) 
we offer with our own IP , we enrich and 
tailor these solutions to the specific 
markets we serve. This improves both 
our competitive positioning and our 
operating profit.
On 1 March 2012, following the  
approach from K3’s largest shareholder,  
Mr PJ Claesson, regarding a possible  
offer for the Company, we announced  
that the Company had received a 
number of indicative proposals and had 
commenced a formal sale process. On  
31 July, we confirmed that discussions 
with interested parties were ongoing, 
however, in a separate statement issued 
today, we have announced that the formal 
sale process has now come to an end. This 
is because the Board does not believe 
the proposals received are at a level that 
would be acceptable to shareholders 
and the proposals are therefore not 
recommendable by the Board. K3 Business Technology Group plc Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 30 June 2012

The tax charge for the year ended  
30 June 2012 was £0.32m (2011: 
£0.43m). The lower charge for 2012 
against 2011 reflected the credits arising 
from finalisation of tax returns in respect 
of prior years and the impact of the 
reduction of the underlying UK tax rate 
on deferred tax.
Adjusted earnings per share
*5
 increased 
by 10% over the year to 30.2p (2011: 
27.5p) and basic earnings per share 
increased by 16% to 20.3p over the year 
(2011: 17.5p).
Cash flows and banking
K3 generates good cash flows, with 
a seasonal weighting in October-
December. Cash generated from 
operations was £7.28m (2011: 
£5.64m). Operating cash flows in 
the year included £1.24m in respect 
of regularising liabilities that were 
significantly outside normal statutory 
due dates and commercial terms at 
the date of acquiring companies and 
trades, £0.59m of acquisition costs, 
£0.32m of exceptional reorganisation 
costs and £0.76m of exceptional income 
relating to the sale of IP . The underlying 
adjusted cash flow from operations
*6
 
therefore was £8.77m (2011: £8.28m), 
representing 77% of adjusted profit 
from operations
*3
 (2011: 86%). The 
reduction in adjusted operating cash*
6
 
reflects tough trading conditions and 
major investment in our managed 
services hosting capabilities and our AX 
product offering. 
During the year the Group made debt 
repayments of £3.64m, paid £0.85m 
of interest, paid tax of £1.31m and 
received proceeds from a placing of 
2,564,408 new ordinary shares of £5.01m 
(net) and additional loans of £4.05m. 
Approximately £7.82m was paid to the 
vendors of the acquisitions we made in 
the year, together with outstanding earn 
out payments of £0.77m from earlier 
acquisitions. Net bank debt at 30 June 
2012 was in line with the prior year at 
£15.68m (30 June 2011: £15.49m).
In September 2012 we agreed the 
extension of existing facilities through 
to December 2013 on the same terms 
with further facilities of up to £2.0m 
committed and a further £3.0m over the 
course of the facility period available to 
fund acquisitions.
Dividend
The Board is pleased to propose a final 
(and total) dividend for the financial 
year of 1.0p per share (2011: 0.75p). 
Subject to shareholder approval at K3’s 
General Meeting, this dividend will be 
become payable on 18 January 2013 to 
shareholders on the register at  
14 December 2012. 
K3’s Annual General Meeting will be held 
on 5 December 2012 at 10.30am, at the 
Group’s head office at Baltimore House, 
50 Kansas Avenue, Manchester M50 2GL.
Outlook
K3’s underlying robustness is 
encouraging and the acquisitions we 
have made have strengthened the Group. 
With the end of the formal sale process, 
we are now re-focusing on our strategy 
for growth. We have a number of medium 
term growth opportunities to leverage 
our large customer base and build on our 
key customer and supplier relationships, 
especially in Managed Services and our 
International operations. 
We see the new financial year as a year 
of investment and will continue to 
invest in new product offerings across 
the Group, with two areas of specific 
focus being our Microsoft Dynamics 
AX product and Managed Services. 
We anticipate that the benefits of our 
investment programme should come 
through during the course of 2013. 
Financially, the Group remains robust, 
with good cash generation and 
banking facilities extended for a  
further year.

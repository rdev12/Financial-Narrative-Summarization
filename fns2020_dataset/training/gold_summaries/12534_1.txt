CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Group strategy
Five years ago, the then new management team established a number of strategic
objectives for future growth of the business:
• Increasing our production from 33 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (kboepd)
(2005) to 50 kboepd;
• Monetising previously discovered resources through commercial negotiation and field
development;
• Adding to the portfolio of development projects and discoveries through exploration
success;
• Seeking value-adding acquisitions in core areas; and
• Creating strong regional businesses with full capability in production, development and
exploration operations.
Over the subsequent five-year period, Premier has made significant strides in meeting all
these objectives:
• 2009 production averaged 44.2 kboepd, exceeding 50 kboepd in the second half of the
year. Projects now under development are expected to add a further 25 kboepd by 2012;
• Booked 2P reserves have increased by 45 per cent and reserves and resources have
more than doubled over the five-year period;
• Premier’s Chim Sáo discoveries in Vietnam in 2006 and 2007 have been followed up with
2009 successes in Vietnam and Norway. Further drilling in Norway and Vietnam and
other exploration targets in the UK and Indonesia are included in the 2010 programme;
• Acquisitions in 2006/7 and in 2009, coinciding with periods of relatively low oil prices,
have been completed successfully in the UK, Indonesia and Vietnam; and
• The North Sea and Asia regional businesses are well-established. We are actively seeking
opportunities to extend from our Pakistan business base across the Middle East region.
“2009 was a year of important acquisitions,
increasing production, great strides in our
development projects and successful
exploration drilling. We have a busy and
exciting programme for 2010 which will
continue to build on our three growing
regional businesses.”
Simon Lockett
Chief Executive 05
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Building on the existing strategy, we expect significant further growth over the coming years:
• A production target of 75 kboepd from existing projects by 2013;
• The potential to add significant further production in the medium-term from projects
currently within the pre-development portfolio;
• An exploration programme, targeting reserve additions of 200 mmboe net to Premier,
from existing geological areas of expertise; and
• Acquisition and new venture activity which will provide future growth potential based
on existing skills within the group.
We expect to maintain a conservative balance sheet through the investment cycle,
facilitating our growth opportunities.
Regionally, our established business units have their own forward plans and strategies:
Asia
In Asia, we seek to develop the full potential for our
Natuna Sea and North Sumatra gas positions in
Indonesia and our growing presence in the Nam Con
Son Basin in Vietnam. Our well-established presence
in the region will allow us to bring relationships,
knowledge and technical skills to new business
opportunities in the area.
Middle East-Pakistan
We seek to maximise the value of our high quality
Pakistan producing gas fields, extending our technical
skills to new regional opportunities, including with our
regional joint venture partner, Emirates International
Investment Company LLC (EIIC).
North Sea and West Africa
Following the Oilexco acquisition and the successful start to our Norwegian exploration
programme, we plan to build on our existing producing asset base and operating capability
by bringing forward discovered reserves into the development portfolio and by exploiting
exploration opportunities in our core areas of the UK Central North Sea and the Norwegian
North Sea. 06

OPERATIONS REVIEW
Production, development and reserves
A strong increase in production was achieved in 2009, principally due to the acquisition of
the Oilexco producing assets completed in May 2009. Significant progress on the
development portfolio was also achieved with both Gajah Baru in Indonesia and Chim Sáo
in Vietnam achieving final project approvals. Both projects are now in the construction
phase with expected first oil and gas in 2011. Existing producing fields, together with new
production from our development projects will keep the company on track to achieve our
75,000 boepd target in the medium-term.
In line with guidance, average working interest production for the full year was 44.2 kboepd
(2008: 36.5 kboepd) of which 7.4 kboepd came from the former Oilexco production portfolio
acquired on 21 May 2009. Also in the UK, the Kyle and Wytch Farm fields performed
strongly though the Scott field remained at 2008 levels, underperforming somewhat due to
facilities issues. Production in other areas remained steady, as strong gas demand and good
production performance were experienced in both Pakistan and Indonesia/Singapore.

West Africa 950 950 800 800
Total 44,200 36,500 40,150 31,750
In the wake of the global financial crisis and the significant fall in oil prices, cost levels in the
industry also fell. The company achieved material development project cost reductions by
optimising and retendering the Chim Sáo and Gajah Baru projects. Both these projects are
now under construction with first production scheduled for 2011. Further progress on our North
Sumatra Block A project in Indonesia could not be achieved because of a delay in the
Production Sharing Contract (PSC) extension. This is expected to be resolved shortly but has
caused first gas to be delayed to 2012. Premier and its partners are working on a fast track 07

solution to develop the Huntington field in the UK, a former Oilexco asset. Floating Production, Storage
and Offtake vessel (FPSO) tenders are being evaluated, alongside tie-back options to nearby
infrastructure, with concept selection expected imminently followed by sanction in the third quarter
of 2010. First oil is targeted for 2012.
As at 31 December 2009 proven and probable reserves, on a working interest basis, based on Premier
and operator estimates were 255 mmboe (2008: 228 mmboe). These reserves comprised 32 per cent
liquids and 68 per cent gas. The equivalent volume on an entitlement basis amounted to 229 mmboe
(2008: 198 mmboe) using a price assumption of US$75 per barrel (bbl) Brent (2008: US$60/bbl Brent).
Booked reserve additions were driven principally by the acquisitions of Oilexco and Delek during the
year. Contingent resources at year-end increased by 59 mmboe to 213 mmboe (2008: 154 mmboe)
driven by resources within the acquired portfolios and by new resources added with the discoveries
at Grosbeak in Norway and Cá Rˆ o `ng –

Asia
In Asia, we are seeking to develop the full potential of our Natuna Sea and North Sumatra gas
positions in Indonesia and our growing presence in the Nam Con Son Basin in Vietnam. Our well
established presence in the region allows us to bring relationships, knowledge and technical skills
to all business opportunities in the area.
Indonesia
During 2009, the Premier-operated Natuna Sea Block A in Indonesia sold an overall average of
153 billion British thermal units per day (BBtud) (gross) from its gas export facility (up 8 per cent
on 2008), whilst the non-operated Kakap Block contributed a further 42 BBtud (gross). Liquids
production from the Block A Anoa field averaged 1,920 barrels of oil per day (bopd) (gross) and
the Kakap fields 3,540 bopd (gross). Overall, net production from Indonesia amounted to
11,050 boepd (2008: 11,700 boepd) on a working interest basis.
Significant progress has been made on the Gajah Baru project, the first of three fields to be
developed to supply additional gas to Singapore and Batam under three new gas sales agreements
(GSAs) signed in 2008 and reported previously. A second tender for the Engineering, Procurement,
Construction and Installation (EPCI) contract was completed on 16 March 2009 with resultant gross
costs savings of approximately US$100 million. Total capital expenditure for the Gajah Baru project
is forecast at around US$700 million (gross). Maximum routine gas sales will be in the order of 140
million standard cubic feet per day (mmscfd) and recoverable reserves from the three new fields are
expected to be 500 billion cubic feet (bcf).
Fabrication of both the wellhead platform jacket and deck continue in Batam. The project was 33
per cent complete at year-end for the construction phase, slightly ahead of schedule. Development
well drilling is scheduled to commence in October 2010 and the project remains on track to deliver
first gas on schedule in October 2011.
On the non-operated North Sumatra Block A, following approval of the Plan of Development for
the Alur Siwah, Alur Rambong and Julu Rayeu gas fields in 2008, Front End Engineering Design
(FEED) studies were completed in 2009 and work continues on optimising the project prior to EPCI
bids. Negotiation of fully-termed agreements for use of ExxonMobil facilities for transportation of
gas and liquids continued. However, the Ministerial Decree relating to the PSC extension remains
unsigned; the delay is impacting the project schedule with first gas scheduled for 2012 from Alur
Rambong and 2013 from Alur Siwah. 08
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW (continued)
Vietnam
Substantial progress was made during the year with the Chim Sáo development. The lower
oil prices at the end of 2008 prompted a review of the Chim Sáo project in which the well
design and producing facilities were optimised, lowering capital expenditure estimates, and
a new FPSO supply contract was negotiated. The re-designed project has all the necessary
partner and government approvals and the prime contracts for EPCI, FPSO and the drilling
rig have been executed. At year-end, the Chim Sáo platform jacket was 83 per cent
complete and its topsides 51 per cent complete, on schedule to allow the main facilities to
be installed in summer 2010. Work on the conversion of the Lewek Emas into an FPSO
commenced in the Keppel shipyard. Development drilling is expected to start in mid-2010
and the FPSO to be installed in the second quarter of 2011. First oil production is forecast
for mid-2011. Project costs are in line with budget.
PetroVietnam Exploration Production Corporation (PVEP) exercised its back-in right for a
15 per cent equity in Block 12W in April 2009. Premier increased its interest in the block
to 53.125 per cent through the acquisition of Delek which completed in July 2009.
India
No progress has been made in 2009 with the Government of India in signing the Ratna
licence. Premier will close its representative office in Delhi in 2010.
North Sea and West Africa
The acquisition of Oilexco in May 2009 significantly increased Premier’s presence in the
North Sea, adding some 60 mmboe of reserves and resources and a capable operating
team in the UK. The acquired assets have been integrated with our existing UK portfolio
and are managed from the new Premier office in Aberdeen, which opened in December.
Premier’s office in Stavanger in Norway continues to focus on the current Norwegian
exploration programme and the integration of our significant technical database across the
North Sea. The North Sea business unit also manages our remaining assets in West Africa.
UK
Total North Sea production was 16,200 boepd for 2009 (2008: 9,300 boepd), of which 7,400
boepd was generated by the acquired Oilexco portfolio. This represents production from
the acquisition completion date of 21 May 2009, averaged over the full year.
There has been a strong underlying performance from Wytch Farm and Kyle, both of which
performed ahead of expectations in 2009. The Wytch Farm oil field contributed 2,770 boepd
net production to Premier, representing a 7 per cent reduction on last year but still producing
ahead of expectations. The operator has temporarily suspended further drilling on Wytch
Farm while the inventory of future drilling targets is upgraded. It is anticipated that investment
in drilling will resume in early 2011. Production from Kyle was 2,660 boepd (2008: 2,500
boepd) without significant field investment during 2009.
The Scott field produced 3,240 boepd (2008: 3,525 boepd) under-performing expectations
as a result of both facilities issues and the failure of the first of the four well infill programme.
Two of the successful infill wells produced relatively high levels of hydrogen sulphide (H
2
S)
and at the end of 2009 the operator was focusing on the management of H
2
S levels.
In the area surrounding the Scott field, Premier is co-operating with other interest owners to
progress the development of a series of discoveries over the Scott facility. The partners in
Bugle agreed to drill an appraisal well which was spudded in February 2010. Premier will
have a 50 per cent equity share in Block 15/23d which contains the original Bugle discovery.
The cost of the well is shared equally with the participants in the neighbouring Block
15/23c. If successful, the Bugle field will be tied back to Scott along with the smaller
Blackhorse discovery. 09
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Premier took control of the Balmoral Floating Production Vessel (FPV) following the Oilexco acquisition,
and as a result of detailed analysis three key risers were replaced during the annual shut-down
period, as part of a longer-term replacement programme which will be completed in 2011.
Further work was carried out on the Balmoral platform to increase the capacity of the gas lift, power
generation and water handling systems. The Burghley field will be tied into these facilities in the
third quarter. Premier is working on a Balmoral field infill opportunity that will be matured in 2010.
Following the acquisition of the Oilexco portfolio, Premier successfully negotiated a new contract
with Sevan Marine ASA pertaining to the Shelley field. The Sevan Voyageur FPSO was hooked up
to the field and commenced production on 6 August at an initial rate of 11,000 boepd. At year-end
the rate had dropped to around 2,200 boepd. It is anticipated that the field abandonment will
commence in 2010.
On the Huntington development project, FPSO bids were received in December and are
currently being evaluated along with tie backs to infrastructure in the vicinity. It is expected that the
development concept will be selected imminently, with project sanction occurring before year-end
2010. It is anticipated that Premier will hold the dominant equity position in the field.
Norway
On the Frøy project in Norway, the joint venture pursued two new work programmes. The first
was to re-evaluate the stand-alone development concept in the light of substantial changes in the
contractor market which occurred as a result of the financial crisis in 2008 and the related drop in oil
price and industry activity. This work indicated that a reduction in costs is feasible, and is now being
pursued in the 2010 work programme. In parallel, the joint venture entered into an area co-operation
study with Statoil and Total who also hold reserves in the area. This study was recently completed
and may lead to further consideration of tie-back opportunities and potentially a joint project for
Frøy with one or more other fields. Given successful outcomes of the work on either option, a
project sanction decision could be taken in 2010 with first oil targeted for 2013.
Mauritania
In Mauritania, 2009 production from the Chinguetti field averaged 950 boepd net to Premier (2008:
950 boepd, net), higher than earlier expectations. The operator continues to assess production
performance from the field.
The joint venture partnerships are currently in discussions with the Mauritanian Government to
extend the existing PSCs covering the remaining potential in the area. In particular, the operator is
undertaking gas development studies for the Banda and Tevet fields, including potential domestic
gas markets, with the aim of concluding this work during 2010. The operator is also re-evaluating
the Tiof field development concept options.
Middle East-Pakistan
Our Middle East-Pakistan business unit seeks to maximise the value of our high quality Pakistan
producing gas fields and to extend our technical skills to new regional opportunities, including with
our regional joint venture partner, EIIC. The joint venture company, PREMCO, is based in Abu Dhabi.
Pakistan
Average production of 15,720 boepd in 2009 surpassed the previous record average production
of 14,550 boepd in 2008 by 8 per cent. Gas demand in 2009 increased year-on-year and was
met primarily from additional production capacity at the Zamzama and Bhit/Badhra fields. This
was achieved through new infill wells, gas plant expansions and shorter maintenance periods.
The Qadirpur gas field produced an average of 4,150 boepd in 2009 (2008: 4,060 boepd). The
project to enhance Qadirpur plant capacity was commissioned in January 2009 and has resulted
in reduced maintenance downtime. A compression project was initiated in 2009 to mitigate the
declining field deliverability. Completion is expected by August 2010. As scheduled, permeate
gas of low heating value will be supplied to Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd from February 2010, 10
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW (continued)
for utilisation at Engro’ s newly constructed power plant near Qadirpur. This supply of permeate
gas will also reduce the quantity of gas flared at the Qadirpur field. Additional stand-by
permeate compressors will be installed at Qadirpur during 2010, to ensure continuous
supply of the permeate gas. During 2009, eight new production wells were successfully drilled
and connected to the production system (including production from the SML horizon of the
Qadirpur Deep-1 exploration well).
The Kadanwari gas field produced an average of 1,250 boepd in 2009 (2008: 1,225 boepd).
The K-14B well was completed and tied into the system in 2009, helping to sustain field
production levels in the year. As a result of successful negotiations with the government, the
Kadanwari lease expiry date was extended for a further 10 years (to 2022), whilst capping
the gas price at an equivalent price of US$8.50 per million British thermal units. The lease
extension will now allow full exploitation of the discovered gas reserves. Two additional
wells, K-19 and K-20, were also drilled during 2009. K-19 has discovered new gas and came
on-stream in March 2010 with an initial flow-rate of 22 mmscfd. K-20 did not initially flow
due to tight reservoir properties but following fracturing has shown positive results.
The Zamzama gas field produced an average of 6,890 boepd in 2009 (2008: 6,075 boepd).
After modifications, the Phase-2 plant was re-commissioned in March 2009 and achieved
production of 127 mmscfd of High Calorific Value gas. Further modifications were planned
for November 2009 to increase the capacity to 150 mmscfd, but these have been deferred
to April 2010, in order to maximise gas revenues during the high winter gas demand
period. The Zamzama North well (commissioned in March 2009), as well as two infill wells
drilled during the year, were tied into the production system, resulting in 13 per cent higher
production in 2009 than in 2008.
The Bhit/Badhra gas fields produced an average of 3,430 boepd in 2009 (2008: 3,190 boepd).
The increase was due to higher available plant capacity, as well as acceptance by the buyer
of some sales gas at slightly less than specification, in order to satisfy their own commitments
during the high gas demand in winter. The drilling of the Bhit-10 well in April 2009 and
installation of wellhead compressors on some wells allowed field deliverability to be
maintained at a high level. The Bado Jabal-1 exploration well did not encounter commercial
gas in its primary targeted zones and was side-tracked to be completed as an additional
producer in the Badhra gas field (from the existing Mughalkot reservoir). First gas was
achieved in March 2010.
FEED was completed in 2009 for the Zarghun South gas field development. First gas is
scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2011. Substantially all of Premier’s capital and operating
costs for its 3.75 per cent working interest are carried by the operator.
Egypt
First oil was achieved at the end of February 2009 from two Al Amir SE wells on the NW
Gemsa licence in Egypt. This was followed by successful appraisal of the Al Amir SE area
and the exploration discovery at Geyad on the same block. In total, the block produced an
average of 2,880 bopd (gross) for the period to 23 December 2009. On this date, Premier
completed the sale of its 10 per cent interest in the permit to Sea Dragon Energy Inc for a
final consideration of US$14.8 million, recording a profit on sale of US$8.4 million. 11
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
EXPLORATION REVIEW
Exploration is a fundamental part of Premier’s growth strategy with a target to add over
200 mmboe of net 2P reserves by 2015. The exploration strategy is to focus on areas
and geological themes where Premier has demonstrable skills and expertise, namely the
exploration of rift basins in Asia and the North Sea, and onshore fold-belt provinces,
as exemplified by Premier’s acreage in Pakistan and Eastern Indonesia.
In 2009, Premier participated in nine exploration and appraisal wells of which five were
successful. Successes included the new oil and gas discoveries at Cá Rˆ o `ng – Do
? -
(Vietnam)
and Grosbeak (Norway), appraising the resource base in the Bream discovery (Norway),
and step-out drilling adding reserves to the Kadanwari field (Pakistan).
Premier continues to acquire the best quality data sets in support of the exploration and appraisal
drilling campaigns, and in 2009 acquired over 1,800km² of 3D to advance the interpretations in
preparation for 2010/2011 drilling in Vietnam and Indonesia. The acquisition of Oilexco presented
an opportunity to purchase 3D data sets across the UK Central North Sea which, when combined
with the Premier data sets in Norway, have established a competitive seismic database across the
whole of the Central North Sea (UK and Norway). In support of the longer-term growth ambitions,
three new licences were acquired in the UK sector of the Central North Sea.
The 2009 exploration and appraisal programme delivered a contingent resource base of
approximately 29 mmboe, subject to further appraisal, at an overall success rate of 55 per cent.

Vietnam
Cá Rˆ o `ng –

(CRD), the first well drilled by Premier in Block 07/03, intersected approximately
90m net oil and gas pay within multiple stacked reservoir layers, two of which were tested
and flowed oil at a combined rate of 3,265 bopd plus 8.1 mmscfd gas, through a 48/64”
choke, with no water production.
Premier acquired and processed 1,006km² 3D seismic over the eastern third of Block 07/03
to determine future exploration and appraisal activity. Premier’s second exploration well
Cá Rˆ o `ng Vàng, located 6km from CRD, was drilled to a total depth of 3,980m BRT and
intersected the reservoir intervals on prognosis. However, wireline logging indicated the
well did not encounter significant hydrocarbons and the well was plugged and abandoned.
Andrew Lodge
Exploration Director 12
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
The results of the wells are now being integrated with the 3D seismic to determine the best
location to appraise CRD and to identify future exploration drilling targets for 2011 drilling.
During 2009, Pan Pacific Petroleum (Vietnam) Pty Ltd acquired 5 per cent and PVEP acquired
10 per cent of Premier’s equity in Block 07/03 in consideration of their funding part of
Premier’s residual 30 per cent interest of the CRD well. Both transactions will require
approval from the Government of Vietnam, which was requested in early 2010.
Elsewhere in Vietnam, the Block 12W exploration acreage outside the Chim Sáo and Dua
field areas was surrendered in November 2009 at the end of the statutory exploration period,
and planning started for the acquisition of 3D seismic data on Block 104-109/05 in 2010.
Indonesia
On the Premier-operated Tuna Block, plans have been updated following the success
in Premier’s Vietnam Block 07/03 immediately to the north in the Nam Con Son Basin.
Following interpretation of the 2,400km 2D, an 850km
2
3D seismic survey was acquired
in September 2009. Interpretation of this survey is ongoing. Prospect selection will follow,
ahead of drilling two exploration wells in 2010.
On Natuna Sea Block A, a five-year exploration plan has been developed for the block,
and due to re-phasing of the nearby development drilling programme, the Anoa Deep
exploration well will now be drilled in 2011.
Elsewhere, on the Japex-operated Buton Block, the 250km 2D seismic survey begun in
2008 was completed by mid-year. Prospect maturation is currently under way and a well is
planned for the fourth quarter of 2010. On the Medco-operated North Sumatra Block A,
further work to define prospects for drilling in 2011 is ongoing.
Premier continues to review opportunities to expand its acreage position in Indonesia
and joint study activities under three agreements with Migas, the Indonesian government
authority, in North Merak (offshore Java), East Asahan (onshore Sumatra) and East
Bangkanai (onshore Kalimantan) were completed in 2009. The East Bangkanai review
has justified follow-up work to be completed in early 2010.
Philippines
In the non-operated SC43 licence, Premier relinquished its 21 per cent participating interest
and withdrew from the licence at the end of 2009.
North Sea and West Africa
UK
The Oilexco acquisition significantly increased Premier’s UK exploration portfolio to a total
of 38 blocks. From this expanded portfolio, Premier plans to drill three exploration and
appraisal wells in 2010. The Bugle North well is in licence P815, Block 15/23d, and spudded
in February. Catcher is a Paleocene amplitude play in licence P1430, Block 28/9 and is due
to spud in April. Premier is in advanced discussions with an interested party to farm down a
15 per cent equity in Block 28/9 as part of ongoing portfolio management activity. Premier
will retain a 35 per cent equity in the licence.
In early 2010 Premier secured a 50 per cent equity and operatorship of Block 22/19c
containing the Oates and Bowers prospects. Block 22/19c covers an extension of the prolific
Paleocene Forties reservoir unit, 10km south of the Huntington development. A well on the
Oates prospect will spud in June 2010.
Premier was awarded two further licences as part of the UK 25th Licence Round. The two
licences awarded were P1628, Block 29/7b near the Kyle field and P1559, Block 15/23e,
adjacent to the Scott/Telford production facilities. Block 29/7b contains the Paleocene
prospects Gladius and Scutum, whilst Block 15/23e has the Upper Jurassic Cornet and
Corniche prospects.
Premier is now looking to the UK 26th Licence Round, announced in February 2010, as an
opportunity to grow the UK exploration portfolio for future drilling campaigns in 2011 and beyond.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW (continued) 13
Premier Oil plc 2009 Annual Report and Financial Statements
Norway
In 2009, Premier participated in its first two exploration and appraisal wells in Norway, both of which
were successful. The programme is continuing into 2010.
On PL407, an appraisal well on the Bream field was drilled and penetrated 18.5m net pay and
tested at a maximum flow rate of 2,516 boepd. This has provided sufficient information for the joint
venture to start development planning, and the concept screening phase was completed in 2009.
A decision on commerciality and further progression of the project will be taken in 2010. On the
nearby Premier-operated PL406 licence, preparations were advanced for the drilling of the
Gardrofa prospect in the third quarter of 2010.
On PL378, a discovery was made at Grosbeak. The well encountered oil and gas pay in the Brent
and Sognefjord formations respectively. Preliminary recoverable volumes range from 25 to 190
mmboe. The Grosbeak discovery will be appraised in the fourth quarter of 2010, and an exploration
well will be drilled to test the adjacent Gnatcatcher prospect.
Since year-end, a well on the Greater Luno prospect on PL359 encountered oil shows but has been
plugged and abandoned as a non-commercial well. On PL374S, a well on the Blåbaer prospect
proved oil in the Lower Jurassic reservoir rocks, which is being appraised with a sidetrack well.
Premier continues to evaluate options to grow the exploration portfolio in Norway and the APA
and Norway 21st Licence Rounds will be reviewed in 2010.
Congo
On the Premier-operated Marine IX licence, the Frida exploration well was drilled to a target depth
of 3,250m. Wireline logging indicated that the well did not encounter significant hydrocarbons, and
the well was plugged and abandoned. In advance of the well, Premier reduced its equity in the
block to 31.5 per cent and consequently reduced the net financial exposure in the well to US$8.4
million. The results of the Frida well are being incorporated into the existing 3D seismic database
prior to deciding whether to enter the next exploration phase in the fourth quarter of 2010.
SADR
Premier awaits resolution of sovereignty issues before pursuing exploration activities in this
prospective area. The four SADR licences currently remain in force majeure.
Middle East-Pakistan
Pakistan
The K-19 exploration step-out well was drilled in the non-operated Kadanwari lease. The well
encountered 12m of high quality net gas pay in the E-sand interval of the Lower Goru formation.
The E-sand interval tested gas at a maximum flow rate of 31 mmscfd at a flowing wellhead pressure
of 3,743 psig with a 40/64” choke. The well was tied into the system in March and is producing gas

The Bado Jabal-1 exploration well was drilled in 2009 in Area A of the Badhra Block, as a
deepening to the Mughalkot reservoir development well. This 5,000m deep well identified both
Lower Goru and Chiltan target formations, but commercial quantities of gas were not encountered.
Since year-end, a well targeting the Pirkoh limestone in the Qadirpur licence has been drilled. It
reached target depth in March and is being plugged and abandoned as a dry hole.

In the non-operated NW Gemsa licence, a well on the Geyad prospect in May encountered oil-
bearing sands in the Kareem formation and the field commenced production shortly thereafter.
The Shehab-1 prospect on the same block was dry. Due to the lack of materiality of the block to
Premier as a whole, Premier’s 10 per cent equity in the licence was sold for a consideration of
US$14.8 million in December 2009.
Egypt continues to represent a target growth area for the company, and consistent with our focus on rift
basin geology Premier successfully bid for the South Darag Block, in the Gulf of Suez, in the Egyptian
General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) 2009 Bid Round. The block is in the process of being awarded
to Premier subject to formal government approvals. A work commitment comprising seismic
reprocessing, geological and geophysical studies will be carried out during the initial exploration period.

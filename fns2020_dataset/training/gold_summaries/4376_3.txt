Net exceptional operating costs were £5.8 million
(year ended 31 December 2008: £nil) and
comprised employee related restructuring costs of
£5.5 million, other restructuring costs of £6.1 million
and the release to the income statement of
negative goodwill of £5.8 million. The employee
related restructuring costs represent rationalisation
and redundancy costs incurred as part of the
Group’s change programme and the integration of
acquired businesses into the Group’s core
operations. The other restructuring costs and
negative goodwill principally relate to the
businesses purchased out of administration.
Net finance income was £1.3 million (year ended 
31 December 2008: £3.5 million). The majority of
this income was associated with the £17.5 million
loan note arising on the sale of the Group’s hosting
and network division in 2008. The loan note was
fully repaid during the current financial period.
The Group reported a net loss before tax from
continuing operations for the period of 
£16.2 million (year ended 31 December 2008: 
£1.5 million).
Basic and diluted loss per share from continuing
operations for the period was 6.82p (year ended 
31 December 2008: 2.09p). Basic adjusted earnings
per share excluding the after tax effect of
amortisation of acquisition related intangible assets,
impairment of fixed assets, share based payments
costs and net exceptional operating costs (as
detailed in note 8) was 4.10p (2008: 0.12p).
The board is not proposing the payment of a final
dividend (year ended 31 December 2008: £nil).
DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS
Discontinued operations in 2010 represent the
results of the wireless division which comprises
Freedom4 WiFi Limited (the WiFi business) and
Freedom4 Limited (the WiMAX business). Given
the new focus of the Group, these operations
were no longer considered core to the Group’s
future operations.
On 26 February 2010, the WiFi business was sold to
management for a nominal cash consideration
resulting in a loss on disposal of £0.1 million.
On 24 December 2009 and 6 January 2010, the
Group agreed to acquire both Intel Capital
Corporation’s and Intel Capital (Cayman)
Corporation’s investment in the WiMAX business for
a combined consideration of $2, resulting in an
increase in the Group’s shareholding to 97.2%
(2008: 52.4%). As the business is not intended to
form part of the continuing operations of the
Group, it has not been consolidated, and the
increase in the investment has been valued at $2
in accordance with IFRS 5. The Group’s existing
share in the WiMAX business has a carrying value of
£4.9 million, representing the value of the joint
venture on 30 September 2009, the date on which
it became classified at ‘held for sale’ together with
additional funding up to 31 March 2010.
On 17 June 2010 the Group announced that it had
disposed of its WiMAX spectrum licences for a cash
consideration of £12.5 million.
The WiFi business contributed a loss after tax of
£0.3 million in the period (year ended 
31 December 2008: £0.2 million). The Group’s
share of the loss of the WiMAX joint venture was
£2.5 million (year ended 31 December 2008:
£9.6 million).
In 2008, the sale of the hosting and network services
division gave rise to a profit of £48.8 million, which
together with residual income of £1.1 million
associated with the sale of the broadband and voice
division in 2007 and the loss in 2008 from the
wireless division of £9.1 million resulted in a profit
from discontinued operations of £40.8 million for the
year ended 31 December 2008.
BALANCE SHEET
Net assets for the Group at 31 March 2010 were
£179.3 million, compared to £27.7 million at 
31 December 2008, reflecting the injection of
equity funding and the subsequent acquisitions
during the period.
Intangible assets acquired were £187.0 million
(31 December 2008: £0.1 million) and consist
predominantly of acquired customer relationships.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions was £62.3 million
(31 December 2008: £nil). The deferred tax asset of
£12.0 million (31 December 2008: £nil) primarily
relates to tax losses and fixed asset timing
differences for Vialtus, which are expected to be
utilised against future profits.
Trade and other receivables were £39.6 million 
(31 December 2008: £19.0 million) and comprised
trade receivables of £19.1 million (31 December
2008: £0.3 million) and prepayments and other
receivables of £20.5 million (31 December 2008:
£18.7 million).
Cash in the balance sheet at the period end was
£20.0 million (31 December 2008: £4.6 million).
Disposal groups classified as held for sale of
£4.9 million (31 December 2008: £nil) represented
the carrying value of the Group’s interest in the
remaining wireless business, WiMAX. Financial review continued

Trade and other payables totalled £63.7 million 
(31 December 2008: £1.2 million) and consisted of
trade creditors of £27.4 million (31 December
2008: £0.2 million), accruals and deferred income
of £30.7 million (31 December 2008: £1.0 million)
and other creditors of £5.6 million (31 December
2008: £nil). 
Total borrowings were £28.3 million (31 December
2008: £nil), primarily relating to bank loans and
overdrafts, £27.2 million of which was repayable
within twelve months of the period end date.
Overall net debt was £8.3 million (31 December
2008: net cash of £4.6 million).
In June 2010, the Group entered into a new
£75 million three-year revolving borrowing facility.
This new facility replaces the Group’s previous
finance arrangements, providing adequate funding
to meet the Group’s current cash flow forecast
requirements and to finance further acquisitions.
Other non-current liabilities were £4.8 million 
(31 December 2008: £nil) which included the
contingent earn-out consideration of £2.6 million
payable to the former owners of MCL. The
calculation of this consideration is to be based on
the earnings generated by the business during a
12 month post-completion earn-out period.
Provisions of £2.9 million (31 December 2008: £nil)
were held to cover onerous lease liabilities within
the Vialtus business. The substantial deferred tax
liability of £34.8 million (31 December 2008: £nil)
arose from the IFRS acquisition accounting
treatment applied to customer relationship
intangible asset valuations. This liability will unwind
over future periods as these intangible assets 
are amortised.
CASH FLOW STATEMENT
The significant items disclosed in the cash flow
statement for the period ended 31 March 2010
include the cash outflow of £90.5 million for current
period acquisitions. These acquisitions were part-
funded through the issue of ordinary shares which
generated a cash inflow, after deducting transaction
costs, of £78.5 million.
The loan note of £17.5 million which arose on the
sale of the Group’s hosting and network division in
2008 was fully repaid during the period.
The Group generated a cash outflow from
operations of £1.6 million (year ended
31 December 2008: inflow of£0.1 million) from
its continuing operations which includes
exceptional cash costs of £9.8 million.
The underlying positive operating cashflow
(excluding exceptional cash costs of £9.8 million)
for the period was £8.2 million and is indicative of
the Group’s ability to convert adjusted EBITDA 
to cash.
IFRS 8
IFRS 8, “Operating Segments”, has been adopted
by the Group from 1 January 2009. IFRS 8 requires
the Group to amend its segmental reporting so that
it aligns fully with the internal management
structure. The segments were Daisy retail, Daisy
wholesale, system services, mobile distribution and
central costs consistent with internal reporting and
review processes at 31 March 2010. For the year
ending 31 March 2011, the Group will be changing
its segments and internal reporting processes to
more closely align with the strategic objectives
which will result in the reporting of segmental
information by product group. 
The new segments will be network services, data
solutions, mobile solutions, system services,
wholesale and mobile distribution. We have
disclosed supplementary financial information
including revenue and gross margin in this revised
format within the segmental information of the
consolidated financial statements for the period
ended 31 March 2010.

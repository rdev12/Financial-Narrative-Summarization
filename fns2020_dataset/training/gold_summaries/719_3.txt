Delivering robust results
Our customer 
numbers have 
grown from less 
than 100 in 2007 
to over 600  
in 2010
We are now a business with significant and 
growing overseas customers and operations
The 2010 financial year has been 
another year of considerable success  
for Allocate. We have grown our 
revenues and profits in all of our core 
markets and we continue to execute 
well against our strategy.
As is clear from our results, Allocate has 
evolved over the last four years. In the 
2007 financial year, we reported revenue 
of £8.3m, a trading profit of £1.0m and 
diluted adjusted EPS of 2.29p. In 2010 
we have reported revenue of £22.0m,  
a trading profit of £3.5m and diluted 
adjusted EPS of 6.31p. This represents  
a compound growth in revenue of 39% 
per annum over the period, 50% in 
trading profits and 40% in diluted 
adjusted EPS.
In 2006, we were a business focused 
mainly on the Defence and Maritime 
markets, having relatively little overseas 
presence, little Healthcare market 
penetration and using an operating 
model which was based upon a small 
number of large licence transactions 
followed by bespoke, complex, 
services projects. 
We are now a business well established 
in three distinct customer markets, 
Healthcare, Defence and Maritime, of 
which Healthcare in 2010 represented 
some 67% of our revenue. Our customer 
numbers have grown from less than 100 
in 2007 to over 600 in 2010. We are now 
a business with significant and growing 
overseas customers and operations and 
have established a financial model that 
is accelerating the proportion of repeat 
revenues from our broad and growing 
customer base.
Allied with continued disciplined 
management practices, this breadth of 
business operations provides Allocate 
with not only a wide range of future 
opportunities, but also with a cushion 
should a single market or territory face 
economic challenges in the future.
I was also pleased to welcome Chris 
Gale to the position of CFO this year. 
Chris’ appointment comes at a time 
when Allocate has begun its 
international expansion, following  
the recent acquisition of Time Care. 
Chris brings a wealth of experience 
transacting deals in Europe and North 
America and he has held a number of 
senior financial roles in international 
public companies within the IT industry. 
Our results for the 2010 financial year 
were excellent and the outlook for  
the 2011 financial year is for further 
progress. Whilst management has 
established firm foundations for 
continuing growth across its three 
vertical markets, Allocate’s largest 
market remains the NHS in the UK. 
We note the recently issued 
government White Paper on the NHS 
and continue to seek further clarity over 
the government’s plans as they are 
published. However, based on the 
information made available to date, 
whilst a number of questions remain 
open with respect to the structure of 
the procurement authorities within the 
NHS, we believe that demand for our 
products will continue as they represent 
compelling value, particularly when 
finances are tight. We will seek to work 
with whichever new organisations are  Allocate Software plc

granted responsibility for procurement 
in the NHS, as and when such changes 
are implemented, and we remain 
confident of continuing to expand  
our business. 
During the year we have made two 
successful acquisitions, of Time Care 
and Dynamic Change, and we  
continue to seek further investment 
opportunities to further enhance 
shareholder value. Despite the global 
economic climate, the Directors believe 
the Company is well positioned for 
another successful year.
I would like to thank our customers  
and partners for their business, their 
commitment to the Allocate products 
and their engagement with the 
Allocate vision. Finally, I would like to 
recognise and thank the Company’s 
employees for another year of hard 
work and dedication in support of the 
Company’s success.

“If tangible savings identified so far are replicated 
across the organisation, and there is no reason to 
suggest that this would not be the case, it would 
mean we exceed our forecasted savings of £2 million 
over a three year period.”

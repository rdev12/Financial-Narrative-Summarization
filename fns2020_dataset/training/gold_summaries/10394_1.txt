Chief Executive’s strategy overview
What drives MITIE’s success, 
year after year?
I don’t think of MITIE as 25 years old, but 
as a young dynamic company. We are 
still keen on breaking barriers, pushing 
against ‘no can do’ attitudes and are 
as enthused and energised as ever by 
the opportunities around us. We are 
driven by the same thing now as we 
were at the very beginning – a passion 
for the innovative thinking that can help 
clients to get where they want to be, 
quickly and cost-efficiently. 
By taking on those services which are 
not core to our clients’ operations, 
we improve standards and save them 
money, giving our clients more choices 
over how to spend their budgets. 
Getting the speciﬁcation and agreed 
service levels absolutely right are the 
keys to a successful contract. Our skill 
base lies in mobilising teams and 
transferring people from the client’s 
organisation to ours, no matter how 
large or small the contract. We also 
deliver what we say we’ll deliver, 
precisely when we say we’ll deliver it. 
To some extent, we can do this by 
drawing on experience and know-
how developed over the last quarter-
century. However, our success is also 
down to continually investing in 
innovative IT solutions that transform 
the notion of customer service.
Whether we are delivering integrated 
facilities management or any of our 
specialist single services, clients 
appreciate what we do and come 
back for more – which is why we’ve 
grown every year since 1987 .

Governance Accounts Business review Overview
Are your markets changing, 
and if so how?
Our markets are changing at the fastest 
rate we have seen in over two decades.
As the graphic on the previous page 
illustrates, there has been a general 
shift in outsourcing, from the time in 
the 1980s when most services were 
carried out by in-house teams to the 
early years of this century which saw 
a rise in bundled services, integrated 
facilities management (FM) and 
strategic outsourcing. 
What is new is the pace of change. 
Our clients’ business models are 
changing, and they are changing fast. 
Clients have always wanted more for 
less, but now they want a lot more for a 
lot less, driven by pressures to transform 
their infrastructure, reduce their energy 
consumption and save money at the 
same time. Many clients do not want 
to be concerned with delivering 
services beyond their core businesses, 
so this is creating increased 
opportunities for us, particularly with 
large organisations. Equally, many of 
our clients still rely on us for our specialist 
single services and we remain 
focused on helping all our clients, 
whatever their needs.
The New contract summary on page 25 
shows how these opportunities have 
translated into contracts during the 
year, a number of which are particularly 
signiﬁcant in terms of the scope and 
scale of services they offer. 
In April this year we signed a £775m, 
ﬁve year contract to deliver integrated 
facilities and energy management for 
Lloyds Banking Group (LBG). The LBG 
estate encompasses over 3,000 
buildings and as part of the contract 
we will welcome an extra 3,000 people 
to the MITIE team. Our relationship with 
LBG began as a single service cleaning 
contract in 1987 when we ﬁrst started, 
so this is a ﬁne example of how a good 
working relationship can blossom into a 
great and much more extensive one.
In addition, the year saw a successful 
rebid with the Cumbrian Collaboration, 
with the new expanded contract to 
provide integrated FM and energy 
services valued at over £200m over 
ﬁve years. Our new contract with 
Diageo is another example of how 
a single service contract can grow into 
an expanded deal that could be worth 
over four times the original amount. 
In the public sector, we were proud 
to secure some similarly signiﬁcant 
contracts in the last 12 months. 
In January, we entered into a new 
partnership agreement with the Prison 
Service to bid for the management 
of nine prisons. It’s an agreement that 
signals a new approach to competition 
for the Prison Service and will harness 
the expertise and experience of both 
organisations to compete for and 
manage 15-year prison contracts. 
During the year, we were appointed 
to the Ministry of Justice’s (MoJ) Total 
Facilities Management Framework 
and subsequently awarded two major 
contracts: for Her Majesty’s Courts and 
Tribunal Service in the South of England; 
and for Brixton and Isis prisons. 
The total value will be £200m-£455m 
over ﬁve to seven years. Furthermore, 
we formed a ten year partnership 
with Essex County Council to service 
over 350 sites, with a total value of up 
to £100m. 
In energy services, which provides some 
34% of our revenues, among several 
other important projects we were 
appointed to deliver a landmark £35m 
energy centre in Scotland. More than 
1,200 homes in Fife will receive all their 
heat and hot water from a new energy 
centre powered by MITIE enterprise 
and 38,000 tonnes of waste wood.
Following our appointment to the NHS 
Carbon and Energy Fund, which will 
enable NHS Trusts to upgrade their 
energy infrastructure and save energy, 
we have been appointed preferred 
bidder to develop a new energy 
centre at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in 
Cambridge. The innovative centre 
will save £4.6m in annual energy costs, 
which is equivalent to hiring 21 7 extra 
nurses each year. It will also save almost 
30,000 tonnes of CO2 each year and 
help the Cambridge NHS Trust to surpass 
their sustainability targets.
However, this doesn’t mean we are 
focused only on new or large clients. 
Every contract is important to us, 
none more so than repeat business 
from existing clients. We value our 
smaller clients enormously, many 
of whom are at an early stage in 
the journey towards large-scale 
outsourcing – and we are the perfect 
partners to help them take the next 
steps in line with their chosen strategies.

Chief Executive’s strategy overview
 
Does this mean you’re 
changing strategy?
Although the size of contracts have 
changed, the fundamentals of our 
strategy remain the same – to provide 
value for all our stakeholders through a 
focus on sustainable, proﬁtable growth. 
As the graphic explains, we continue 
to focus on clients, people, risk, 
responsibility, new markets, operational 
excellence and acquisitions.
However, it’s fair to say that as 
markets and opportunities evolve we 
will ﬁne-tune the strategy to meet new 
challenges as they arise. Energy services 
will be a strong focus for us in the years 
ahead and international opportunities 
will also continue to be central to our 
plans. We go wherever our clients need 
us to go, and in more and more 
instances they are asking us to provide 
the same high quality services overseas 
that they already access in the UK.
In terms of acquisitions, we purchased 
two companies during the year: 
Utilyx, the leading energy and 
carbon specialists; and Direct Enquiries, 
the UK’s leading access and disability 
consultants. Both acquisitions bring 
great expertise into MITIE and we 
were delighted to welcome all the 
people into MITIE.
How can a company as large as 
MITIE still be entrepreneurial?
MITIE stands for Management Incentive 
Through Investment Equity and the spirit 
of entrepreneurialism has always been 
at the heart of our organisation. 
Of course, that’s a lot easier for a 
company with a few dozen employees 
than it is for one the size we are today, 
but we’re still as passionate about 
entrepreneurialism as we were on day 
one. Over the years, we’ve supported 
over 100 start-up businesses to grow 
using the MITIE Model, which helps 
talented management teams turn 
ideas into reality. Start-ups keep you 
young, fresh and innovative, and the 
teams have huge amounts of energy. 
It’s structured so that the management 
team takes an equity stake of up to 49% 
in a business which they grow over a ﬁve 
to ten year period before being 
acquired by MITIE in full. 
In 201 1, we launched a £10m fund 
to encourage more entrepreneurs 
to start-up businesses and during 
201 1 we invested nearly half of that 
money. In order to encourage another 
group of entrepreneurs to come to us 
with ideas, in May 2012 we hosted a 
‘Dragons’ Den’ style event where 
entrepreneurs pitched their ideas to a 
panel of expert judges. The entrepreneur 
with the best pitch on the day secured 
an investment to start a business. 
As always, we look to start businesses 
that expand the range of services we 
offer to our clients, or that will lead us 
into new markets. Our entrepreneurial 
model is one of the best ways to do this, 
as well as being core to our culture.

is largely unchanged, although 
each year the areas of focus

Governance Accounts Business review Overview
How do you motivate over 
63,000 people?
As we grow as a business, we are 
dedicated to creating an environment 
in which each and every individual 
can ﬂourish – recognising and rewarding 
performance, nurturing talent and 
providing career opportunities. 
We understand what makes people 
tick and we know how important it is 
that they feel valued. Equity participation 
has always been at the heart of our 
business and is in place to varying 
degrees across the organisation – 
share schemes certainly promote 
loyalty because they align people 
with the objectives of the business. 
During the year we launched a new 
voluntary all-employee share plan, 
which will run alongside the existing 
Save as You Earn Scheme we currently 
offer. This gives everyone another 
chance to invest in our company and 
save for their future. We also continue 
to grow and enhance MITIE Rewards, 
a fantastic beneﬁts scheme for all our 
people that is a gateway to making 
savings and gaining discounts at over 
2,500 retailers.
We know what capabilities we need 
to grow our business and are very 
focused on spotting and developing 
the potential talent we have within our 
organisation. We have a very clear view 
of our talent pipeline for key roles across 
the business and have put processes in 
place to ensure our key talent is in the 
right place at the right time.
We’ve always prided ourselves on 
being different and one step ahead 
in the way we communicate with our 
people. Social media frightens some 
organisations but we embrace it 
wholeheartedly – Facebook and 
Twitter are how our people choose to 
communicate. So it makes absolute 
sense for us to communicate with them 
via these channels. The use of social 
media is just one of the things that strike 
people when they join MITIE, especially 
if they’ve transferred in from another 
organisation. It is also one of the many 
reasons we are an employer of choice 
for Generation Y. If you tweet, please 
join in at #25mitie!
This year we have continued to grow 
our use of social media to strengthen 
our brand and connect with customers, 
our people and other stakeholders. 
We have introduced a new Facebook 
page aimed at our people and have 
seen our followers triple on Twitter. 
Along with our You Tube channel which 
has featured our MITIE’s Got Talent and 
Stars competitions along with a range 
of corporate videos, our social media 
channels have helped us to break 
down communication barriers allowing 
us to communicate, engage and build 
relationships with people across the 
industries we work in and we can only 
see them becoming more and more 
important. We are also using an 
enterprise social network which is 
allowing our sales teams to work smarter 
and collaborate across the country. 
On the subject of people, one of the 
most important things for any business 
to succeed is to have inspirational 
leaders. For people to develop and 
succeed in their careers, they need 
mentors who will support and believe 
in them. Ian Stewart has stepped 
down from the Board after 25 years 
of dedicated service to MITIE. For me 
personally, the support, encouragement 
and advice I have had from Ian 
throughout my time at MITIE has been 
invaluable. I would like to thank him for 
being an inspiration and mentor to me 
and so many others. His is a shining 
example of leadership.

Chief Executive’s strategy overview
How do technology and 
innovation play a part at MITIE?
Technology and innovation are real 
points of difference for us. We have 
made signiﬁcant investments in 
innovative IT solutions that transform 
the notion of customer service and 
are fundamental to our ability to 
deliver the most efficient services. 
In particular, MiWorld, our web based 
management information platform, 
gives clients ‘live’ visibility over exactly 
what we’re doing for them, when and 
how well. MiWorld presents an overview 
of the client’s portfolio in one centralised 
location, whether that’s a PC, laptop or 
tablet, it helps them identify asset and 
facility performance issues which can be 
acted upon to improve efficiencies and 
reduce costs. MiWorld helps to support 
our clients’ strategies, by combining 
the FM service costs with their property 
related expenditure such as utility 
expenditure and leases, and presenting 
the total costs of occupancy across their 
entire portfolios, which can be used 
to benchmark performance.
Our use of PDAs (personal digital 
assistants) across the majority of our 
contracts has enabled us to introduce 
vastly different working practices. 
PDAs help us to schedule our mobile 
workforce much more efficiently, 
making sure our people are always 
focusing on doing what they do best – 
delivering great service. 
To date, we’ve invested signiﬁcantly 
in MiWorld, PDAs and other service 
enhancing technologies. During 2012 
that will increase further, and there is 
a lot more to come in future years too. 
We have also recently launched 
Operation Exodus which aims to re-
engineer all of our processes to 
make them electronic over the next 
two years. Delivering an efficient and 
cost effective operation to our clients 
is a top priority . Using the beneﬁts 
of technology , we want to make all of 
our processes simpler and more efficient 
for our people, our customers and our 
supply chain. 
Working more collaboratively with our 
suppliers is also really important when 
it comes to innovation. In many cases 
we work in close consultation with our 
suppliers, involving them in our process 
to create tailored solutions for our clients. 
Our suppliers are also using us to test 
new and pioneering products that they 
are bringing to the market, for example 
through our supplier innovation days. 
In partnership with our supply chain, 
we can offer our clients even more 
forward-thinking solutions.
In what direction do you 
see outsourcing going – 
and how is MITIE placed 
to meet the challenge?
In a business climate like we have 
today, it’s not easy to predict market 
trends. But one thing is crystal clear – 
we’re going to see a lot more about 
‘intelligent’ outsourcing. Of course, 
service delivery remains an absolute 
essential, and self-delivery across a 
broad platform creates advantages 
in terms of integration and added 
value, not only in price but also 
in service quality. But we see the 
future lying in assembling data and 
understanding how the separate 
strands of corporate real estate 
functions interact. 
Until now, this is an area that has not 
been exploited – but there are new 
‘linkages’ emerging on many levels... 
between FM costs and energy 
provision, for example, as well as 
between projects and FM, energy 
and projects, agile working regimes 
and property costs (such as leases, 
rates and valuations), and between 
all these elements of real estate cost 
and the increasing economic and 
legislative demands. 
How can we exploit this situation for our 
clients? By developing new models for 
outsourcing that are based on synergies 
between cost centres and a new, deep 
understanding of the effect that each 
one has on all the others. This approach 
will be built on the intelligent 
aggregation of data and real 
knowledge of Total Operating Costs, 
and will be driven by new technologies.
We’re well placed to assist clients 
with such an exciting development. 
We already have extensive service 
delivery capability – and we’re investing 
in skills and technology to expand this 
even further. As always, the thing that 
will set us apart is our ability to create 
opportunity for our clients in different 
and often ground-breaking ways.
And what about the next 
few years?
The world is a very different place 
today compared to how it was in 1987 . 
Our markets and clients are evolving 
at an unprecedented speed, and this 
is changing both the nature and the 
scale of the opportunities we face.
The last 12 months have seen the 
award of a number of contracts 
that are transforming our business. 
This success is an endorsement of 
our strategy to invest in our integrated 
facilities and energy management 
capabilities, which will underpin the 
continued growth of our business.
Our sales pipeline is strong and our 
order book stands at record levels. 
We are optimistic about the 
opportunities for growth, but recognise 
the wider uncertainties in the global 
economy and in some of our more 
cyclical markets. As governments 
and businesses seek cost and energy 
efficiencies, our track record for service 
delivery, innovation and efficiency 
will continue to differentiate us.
Times change but quality endures. 
Looking ahead, I am conﬁdent 
that the track record of sustainable, 
proﬁtable growth that we have 
maintained for 25 years will continue. 
We are more passionate and excited 
about the future than we have 
ever been.

and exceptional costs of £711,000 relating to the move to the Official List and 
the costs of reorganising Escrow Europe’s corporate and contractual structure. 
Pre tax profit is adjusted for these items and the unwinding of the discount on 
the acquisitions deferred consideration of £333,000. The Directors believe the 
adjusted measures better reflect the ongoing performance of the business.

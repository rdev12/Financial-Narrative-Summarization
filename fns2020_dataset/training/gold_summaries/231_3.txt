CHairMan’S ST aTeMenT
The strategy has produced a strong fundamental 
business with a solid platform for future growth 
and following on from the success to date we 
continue to look for opportunities to expand the 
Group’s offering.
2008/2009	was	a	very	good	year	
for	A CM	and	I	am	delighted	to	
report	such	a	strong	set	of	results.	
The	Group	has	seen	significant	
growth	from	both	its	UK	and	
overseas	offices	and	most	areas	
of	the	business	outperformed	
management	expectations.	
The	complementary	acquisition	
of	Harris	&	Dixon	Shipbrok ers	
(Harris	&	Dixon)	has	been	
successfully	integrated	and	has	
proven	to	be	a	strong	strategic	
addition	to	the	Group.	In	addition,	
the	strengthening	of	the	US	Dollar	
against	the	P ound	in	the	second	
half	of	the	year	had	a	positive	
e f f e c t 	 o n 	 t h e 	 G r o u p ’ s 	 p r o fi t a b i l i t y .	
Resul Ts
The	Group ’s	revenue	from	ship	
broking	increased	in	US	Dollar	
terms	by	29%	to	US$50.9	million	
(2008:	US$39.3	million).	It	was	an	
excellent	period	for	the	spot	desk,	
freight	rates	were	good	through	
the	majority	of	the	year	and	the	
number	of	spot	fixtures	was	up	
19%,	excluding	income	from	
Harris	&	Dixon.	T ime	charter	
continues	to	perform	strongly	and	
delivered	a	33%	revenue	increase	
on	last	year	with	a	forward	order

achievement	given	the	difficult	
conditions	in	the	S&P	mark et	
during	the	year	and	I	am	pleased	
to	say	that,	to	date,	A CM	has	
lost	no	deals	and	the	forward

The	Group ’s	strategy	is	to	gain	
mark et	share	by	expanding	its	
team	of	expert	brok ers	to	enter	
n e w 	 s h i p p i n g 	 s e c t o r s 	 a n d 	 p e n e t r a t e	
new	regional	mark ets,	which	is	
being	achieved	both	organically	
and	through	acquisition.	In	line	
with	this	strategy ,	A CM	acquired	
t h e 	 s p e c i a l i s t 	 s m a l l 	 o i l 	 t a n k e r 	 b r o k e r	
Harris	&	Dixon,	in	June	2008.	Since	
the	acquisition,	Harris	&	Dixon	has	
been	fully	integrated	into	the	Group	
and	outperformed	the	Board’s	
expectations.	In	addition	A CM	has	
formally	opened	its	Indian	office,	
expanded	its	team	of	brok ers	in	
the	UK	and	started	to	see	tangible	
rewards	from	its	Singapore	office.

following	on	from	the	success	
to	date	we	continue	to	look	for

eMployees
The	success	of	A CM	is	due	to	the	
high	quality	of	its	employees	and	
their	commitment	to	ensure	the	
Group	continues	to	strengthen	its	
relationships	with	existing	clients	
a s 	 w e l l 	 a s 	 f o r g i n g 	 n e w 	 r e l a t i o n s h i p s .	
As	the	business	evolves,	the	Group	
continues	to	expand	and	diversify	
its	broking	teams.	It	is	important	
that	the	desks	are	integrated	with	
brok ers	working	together	to	ensure	
maximum	success	of	A CM.	I	would	
lik e	to	thank	all	of	our	employees	
for	their	committed	support	in	
enabling	a	good	set	of	results	
to	be	produced.
CuRRenT TRADinG
T ank er	freight	rates	were	
exceptionally	strong	during	2008.	
A CM	was	well	placed	to	tak e	
advantage	of	this	and	as	a	result	
had	an	excellent	year .	T ank er	rates	
have	fallen	during	the	last	quarter	
and,	in	line	with	mark et	forecasts,	
the	Group	does	not	expect	to	see	
the	same	level	of	revenue	next	
year .	However	there	is	still	an	
ongoing	global	demand	for	oil	
and	the	volume	of	trades	has	
held	up	extremely	well	in	the	first	
two	months	of	the	financial	year .	
T h i s 	 c o m b i n e d 	 w i t h 	 a 	 s o l i d 	 f o r w a r d	
order	book	puts	the	Group	in	
a	strong	position	and	the	Board	
remains	cautiously	optimistic	
about	the	forthcoming	year .

Leaders in  
our markets
Our new organisational structure 
enables us to better understand and 
respond to current and emerging 
customer needs.
Our five Global Business Units (GBUs) are each focused on 
specific sectors; this approach builds greater customer 
intimacy, improves our responsiveness to market, transforms 
opportunities and addresses market challenges with 
innovation, by embracing new solutions. 
Led by a Global Business Director, each has a focused 
strategy and five year plan with projected revenues and 
profitability. The GBUs collaborate in close partnership with 
Group Functions, which in turn bring value through specific 
expertise and knowledge; sharing best practices and 
supporting strategic decision-making.

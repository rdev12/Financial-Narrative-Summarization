National Coverage with a Local Focus
Consumers are increasingly demanding news as it happens 
and our journalists work hard to be the first to report breaking 
stories. They are part of their communities and have wide-
ranging networks of contacts, helping to ensure they know 
what is happening and when.
Johnston Printing
We operate modern, high-speed printing 
presses at three centres: Sheffield and 
Portsmouth in England, and Carn in 
Northern Ireland. In addition to publishing 
our own titles, we hold several national 
contracts to provide printing services  
to other newspaper and industry groups.
Community Involvement
Our newspapers and websites remain 
trusted providers of information in the 
communities we serve. Campaigns,  
local events and fund-raising activities 
build strong links with audiences and 
cement our titles’ roles as the voices  
of their communities.

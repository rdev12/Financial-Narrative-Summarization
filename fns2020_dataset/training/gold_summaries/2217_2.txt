The UK retail licensee for the original Californian surf, snow and lifestyle brand, 
founded in 1952 by Jack O’Neill, continues to produce functional and innovative 
boardriding products. The core values, innovation in style and technology, have 
seen the brand devote itself wholeheartedly to the evolution of action sports. 
Now a global brand, O’Neill will always be committed to progressing that 
evolution and growing its reputation as one of the world’s leading youth 
lifestyle brands.
 Outdoor
The heritage of Blacks can be traced back to 1861 when Thomas Black founded his 
sail making company in Greenock, Scotland. The advent of steamship required the 
transferring of their skills into another business of tent making.
In 1994 the renamed Blacks Outdoor concentrated its strength in a broader range 
of outdoor activities; from walking and mountaineering to skiing and snowboarding. 
Blacks stocks specialist brands such as North Face and Berghaus as well as 
developing our own specialist brands such as Technicals and ALS. Blacks is one of 
the country’s leading outdoor retailers. The style and the design of the stores have 
been developed to meet the requirements of the modern marketplace.
Founded in 1893, Millets’ core values still hold true today; to offer a comprehensive 
range of outdoor clothing and equipment at great value for money from friendly, 
knowledgeable staff. Millets remains the country’s largest outdoor retailer stocking 
a large number of leading specialist brands, including Peter Storm, the UK’s most 
popular outdoor clothing brand, Eurohike, the UK’s most popular outdoor equipment 
brand, as well as Berghaus, Merrell, Coleman, Karrimor, Hi-Tec, Columbia,   and 
many more.
We are delighted to be able to support one of the leading young persons adventurous 
activity and personal development groups in the world. With over 400,000 active 
members in the UK we have created a formal association between Millets and the 
Scouts that is due to operate until at least the end of 2011.

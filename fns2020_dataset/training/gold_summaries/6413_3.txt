 GameAccount Network plc Annual report and accounts 2013 04
Chairman’s report 
Dear fellow shareholders 
I would like to thank you all for your 
support since the inception of 
GameAccount Network in 2002. 
During the intervening 11 years  
we have come a long way from  
our origins of four employees 
operating from serviced offices. 
We have evolved from a developer 
and provider of pure games of skill 
into a leading enterprise-level 
technology solution provider for 
land-based casino operators in 
regulated Internet gaming markets.
We believe our vibrant innovative 
business mix will generate 
substantial shareholder value over 
the next few years. 2013 has been 
a momentous year for our 
Company with admission to both 
the AIM and ESM markets, healthy 
profits and a strong balance sheet, 
which should expedite our 
expansion plans in the United 
States in particular.
We welcome regulatory changes 
in the United States, the United 
Kingdom, Spain and Italy where 
we believe we are well positioned 
to grow sustainable revenues.
GameAccount Network is 
committed to maintaining a Board 
composition that complies with 
the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and we have further 
strengthened our Board with the 
recent appointment of Seamus 
McGill as an independent non-
executive director.
Finally, the Board and I would like 
to thank all GameAccount 
Network employees for their work 
and commitment over the last 
year. Our people, culture and their 
commitment to excellence are 
among our greatest assets.
We look forward to the 
opportunities in 2014 and 2015 
during which we believe we can be 
a substantial player on the world 
stage as regulation of Internet 
gaming continues to unfold.

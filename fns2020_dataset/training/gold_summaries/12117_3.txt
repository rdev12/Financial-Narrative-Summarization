 Chairman’s Statement
This year, this is not an easy statement for me to write as 
I look back on a year filled with no small share of challenge. 
It is right for me to talk about those challenges, but at the 
same time I do want to focus attention very clearly on our 
Group’s future. 
Overall, trading this year has been disappointing. Difficult 
trading conditions combined with the loss of a supplier 
contract negatively impacted the financial performance. 
Revenue for the year was £233.4m (2013: £250.0m), a 6.7% 
reduction from the prior year. Our profitability also reduced, 
with underlying operating profit of £17.7m (2013: £19.0m) 
and underlying EBITDA of £30.5m (2013: £33.0m). However 
at 31 March 2014 we can point to a net debt (including 
finance leases) of £56.1m: a reduction of £15.2m on the 
prior year, aided by our equity placing and by improvements 
in working capital management.
Our energy as a Board is now focused on repositioning the 
Group so it is better placed to compete in the markets we 
address. Phoenix IT has a strong heritage and excellent 
experience in the UK IT services market. Whilst this year has 
not been without challenge, a good number of the right kinds 
of achievement have also been made. On 17 March 2014, we 
raised £8.3m net proceeds in an equity placing. We have 
achieved Platinum Partner status with Hewlett Packard, 
and have been named BT ICT Partner of the Year. We have 
increased the level of business with some customers to the 
largest it has ever been. New services, such as CloudSure 
UK, our cloud infrastructure service, are bringing new 
customers to the Group and re-energising our team’s belief 
in what Phoenix IT can achieve.
What we must do now is ensure that all of these assets, 
relationships and differentiators are pointed squarely at 
where the opportunities lie. This is what Steve sets out in his 
first Chief Executive’s Review.
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 1.0p per share 
(2013: 4.0p per share) which, if approved at the Annual 
General Meeting of the Group, will be paid on 29 September 
2014 to Shareholders on the register as at 22 August 2014. 
Combined with the interim dividend of 1.6p per share  
(2013: 3.7p per share) paid on 8 January 2014, this results 
in a total dividend for the year of 2.6p per share (2013: 7.7p 
per share).
Looking ahead, the Board has resolved to realign its dividend 
policy. This year we have resolved to favour the further 
reduction of our debt ahead of dividend payment. In future 
years we will seek to operate a new dividend policy which 
will be aligned with measures of the underlying performance 
of the Group.
Board Changes
We have a strengthened management team in place to take 
the Group forward. That team is headed by Steve Vaughan 
who joined our Board on 12 March 2014 as Chief Executive. 
Steve has already achieved a great deal in his first few 
months, most notably the development of a plan to improve 
the Group’s fortunes. Steve brings to Phoenix IT over  
30 years of experience in the technology sector, including a 
14 year career at EDS (UK). Steve has built, bolstered and 
energised several public companies, including Synstar plc 
from 2001 to 2005; Communisis plc from 2006 to 2010; and 
served between July 2013 and February 2014 as Chairman 
of Charteris plc, leading that firm’ s successful sale. My Board 
colleagues and I are pleased to welcome him to the Group.
Turning to other changes, on 30 October 2013 David Warnock 
stepped down from our Board as a Non-Executive Director. 
Robin Taylor was appointed as a new Non-Executive 
member of our Board on 1 November 2013 and I am 
delighted that Robin has also taken the role of Chairman  
of our Audit Committee. I have also changed my role, 
moving from Executive to Non-Executive Chairman on  
1 April 2014.
Finally, we have one further change to announce. With effect 
from 10 June 2014, Brian Sellwood is stepping down from 
his Non-Executive position on our Board. On behalf of the 
Board, I want to thank both he and David warmly for their 
many contributions.

Employees
I would like to thank each of our employees for their 
continued commitment and energy this year and wish 
them all the very best for the year ahead.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting of the Group will be held on 
25 September 2014 at 09.30, and will take place at our 
Group’s office at Oakwell Way, Birstall, Leeds.
Outlook
I believe that the future is more assured today than it 
has been for many months. We now have a strong, 
focused executive and senior management team in place,  
a plan to drive the business forward and a lower net debt 
position than for many years.

Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Results
Revenue increased to £113.6m (2012: 
£108.2m). Group adjusted profit before tax 
rose to £10.0m (2012: £9.1m
1
), while Group 
statutory profit before tax increased to 
£6.9m (2012: £6.6m
1
). Adjusted earnings 
per share rose to 20.05p (2012: 18.33p
1
). 
Statutory earnings per share fell to 14.22p 
(2012: 15.14p
1
).
Our professional services businesses 
generated increased revenue and operating 
segment profit driven by a solid 
performance in Management Services and 
strong growth in Adjusting Services where 
we are reaping the benefits of the continued 
investment in new offices and people. 
Insurance Support Services continues to 
face challenges, mainly due to the loss of 
some larger legacy contracts which have 
only been partly compensated by new 
business. Our Insurers in Run-off  
business performed as expected with 
operating segment profit attributable to  
shareholders down. 
See Group CFO’s Report page 15.
Dividend
It is proposed that a final dividend of 6.75p 
per share (2012: 6.75p) be paid on 23 May 
2014 to shareholders on the register on 
11 April 2014. When added to the interim 
dividend of 3.25p per share (2012: 3.25p), 
this results in the total dividend per share 
for the year being maintained at 10.00p 
(2012: 10.00p).
Balance sheet
Net debt increased at the year end to 
£32.4m (2012: £29.5m) and free cash flow 
decreased to £5.5m (2012: £12.4m). This 
was largely as a result of acquisitions made 
during the year, an increase in working 
capital in Adjusting Services, and 
restructuring costs. We continue to focus 
on managing our debt while investing  
for growth. 
We completed the refinancing of the 
Group’s senior term debt and revolving 
credit facilities for a term of five years.  
Net pension liabilities fell compared to the 
prior year end as a result of improving 
market conditions. 
See Group CFO’s Report page 15.

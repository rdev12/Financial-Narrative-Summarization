 Alexandra plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 3
Overview
In this, my first statement as Chairman, I am
pleased to report that during the financial year
2003/4, the Group achieved its primary
objectives of increasing profit and reducing
borrowings. Profit before taxation increased by
14.4% to £4.44 million and borrowings fell by
£5.4 million to £14.5 million.  
This positive result has been achieved in a
competitive trading environment in which the
Company has concentrated its sales effort on
securing good quality contracts.
Financial Performance
Turnover at £70.41 million was 4.1% lower
(2003: £73.38 million) due to a reduction in
average selling prices of 6%. This has been partially
offset by an increase in sales volumes of 2%.
The gross margin for the year was 38.9% (2003:
39.3%) with the Company benefiting from reduced
input costs while maintaining product quality.  
Profit before tax increased by 14.4% to £4.44
million (2003: £3.88 million). This was achieved
through strict overhead control that reduced selling
and administration costs by £1.44 million.  
Earnings per share were 11% higher at 9.1p
(2003: 8.2p). A profit on fixed asset disposals
of £165,000 (2003: loss £101,000) contributed
to this.
Strong operational cash flow and tight control over
working capital resulted in net debt falling from
£19.9 million to £14.5 million. Gearing at 31
January 2004 was 48%, a significant reduction
from 70% at the previous year end and interest
cover improved from 4.1 times to 5.6 times.  
Dividend
The Board is proposing a 10% increase in the
final dividend to 3.3p per share (2003: 3.0p).
This, with the interim dividend of 1.7p (2003:
1.6p), makes a total dividend for the year of
5.0p, an increase of 8.7% on the total of 4.6p
paid last year.  If approved at the AGM on
29 June 2004 the final dividend will be paid
on 9 July 2004 to shareholders on the register
at 11 June 2004.
Board changes
As previously announced David Dunn retired on
31 January 2004 and I have succeeded him as
Chairman. David Dunn joined the Alexandra plc
Board in April 1989 and was Chairman from
31 December 1997 . During his 15 years  on the
Board he has been directly involved in the
transformation of the Group from textile
manufacturer to a service business that sources its
garments globally. My colleagues and I would like
to thank him for his contribution over this period. 
Martin Foyle resigned from the Board as Sales and
Marketing Director on 31 August 2003. In the four
years he was with Alexandra he made a significant
contribution to the Group and we wish him well in
the future in his new consultancy business.
With the intention of strengthening the Board Ken
Gibbs, previously a Finance Director at Hewlett
Packard, has joined the Group as Corporate Planning
Director (designate).
Staff
The strength of Alexandra remains our employees
who continue to demonstrate their enthusiasm
and commitment to succeed. The focus in every
department remains customer service and the
Board thanks them for their hard work and
contribution in the past year.
Current trading and prospects
The new year has started well with a strong
order book and this augurs well for the full
year. We have introduced some new initiatives
to increase sales and further reduce costs and
expect to see the benefits of these later in the
year. We have also seen the hard work of the
last twelve months paying off with
several new and prestigious accounts
awarded during the new year. 
Conclusion
The business has been considerably
strengthened and both the Board and
management are confident this will
have a positive impact on the future
performance of the Group.

Chairman’s Statement
Archie Norman
Dear Shareholder
ITV today is a much stronger business in almost every 
respect than when the restructured Board and leadership 
team were formed four years ago. When we set out our 
transformation programme in 2010 the core objective was 
to rebalance the business, to open up new growth paths, and 
to ensure it is more resilient in a changing media landscape. 
Whilst there is much further to go, this programme is well 
under way with strong growth in all sources of non-net 
advertising revenue. 
After years of underperformance, our content business is 
now delivering consistent growth under strong creative 
leadership. Selected international acquisitions have 
accelerated progress, particularly in the USA, to form the 
basis for a global content network. Meanwhile, online, pay 
and sponsorships have all shown strong and profitable 
growth. This has been achieved against the backdrop of 
difficult economic conditions and subdued consumer 
markets.
As a result ITV today is in unrecognisably better health, with 
strong leadership and a good talent base at all levels. This 
does not of course mean we can afford to let the pace of 
change diminish. While the traditional broadcast television 
model remains robust, the market for ‘television-like’ 
content is changing faster than ever with new forms
of viewing emerging, more catch up, more consumption on 
connected and mobile devices and indeed new entrants 
competing for share of the viewers’ time. Therefore we 
must continue to adapt ITV to take advantage of these 
opportunities.
We see great opportunities ahead as we build on the 
creative capability of ITV internationally. However, these 
will also pose challenges to the way we work internally and 
externally. And as we extend our reach it remains vital to 
sustain the health of our growing channel family in the UK 
and especially of our flagship channel ITV.
Our ability to tackle these challenges with confidence is 
reinforced by the transformation of our financial position 
which has been the result of tight cash management, 
debt restructuring and cost control: we now have a robust 
balance sheet and strong cash flow generation. The Board 
is very mindful of the need to balance the investment 
requirements of the business to deliver future growth with 
increasing shareholder returns. The Board has proposed a 
35% increase in the ordinary dividend to 3.5p and a 4.0p 
special dividend in line with last year.
ITV remains a regulated business and as the media 
landscape changes we continue to see the need for the 
relaxation of regulatory constraints as non-regulated 
forms of competition grow. However , we are pleased that 
our public service licences have now finally been renewed 
providing a stable platform for another ten years.
“We are a talent driven, people 
intensive business. Our 
progress has been driven by 
the leadership, creativity and 
motivation of our people”

Our philosophy of management has been to combine very 
strong commercial and management leadership with great 
creative talent. This approach is also reflected at Board 
level where we seek to retain a mix of deep commercial 
and creative understanding around the Board table. I am 
delighted therefore that Sir Peter Bazalgette has joined our 
Board this year . Mike Clasper , who made a huge contribution 
to the Board in good times and bad over the last eight years 
has stood down with our thanks.
Finally, we are a talent driven, people intensive business. 
Our progress has been driven by the leadership, creativity 
and motivation of our people. And I want to thank all our 
colleagues at ITV for their hard work, and our shareholders 
for their continuing support.

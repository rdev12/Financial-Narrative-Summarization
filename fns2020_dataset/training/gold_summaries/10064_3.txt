 I am pleased to report Melrose’s fifth set of annual results since
flotation in October 2003.
Results for the continuing group
Following the sale of McKechnie Aerospace and Aerospace
Aftermarket divisions (“McKechnie Aerospace”) and the majority 
of our PSM division (“PSM”) (together the “Disposals”), these
accounts report the results of our businesses for the twelve months 
to 31 December 2007 and the relevant comparatives for the previous
year. They take into account the effect of the return of capital and
share consolidation during August 2007.
Revenue for the year was £344.0 million (2006: £323.6 million).
Headline profit before tax (before exceptional costs, exceptional
income and intangible asset amortisation other than computer
software) was £27.0 million (2006: £12.1 million). 
After these items the profit before tax was £21.2 million (2006: 
£4.8 million) and basic earnings per share were 7.4p (2006: 1.2p)
Further explanation of these results is provided in the Finance
Director’s review.
Our businesses and their employees have worked very hard to
produce these good results and I thank them on behalf of our
shareholders.
2007 was a very busy year 
in which much was achieved. 
In May we sold McKechnie
Aerospace for £428 million and
PSM for £30 million realising 
a combined profit of over 
£190 million in the two years
since acquisition.

Chairman’s statement
08_1022_Melrose_R&A:12736_Melrose_RA  26/3/08  18:19  Page 04 2007 was a very busy year in which much was achieved. In May we
sold McKechnie Aerospace for £428 million and PSM for £30 million
realising a combined profit of over £190 million in the two years since
acquisition. In line with our stated objectives, we returned £220
million of capital to shareholders in August. Together with dividends
this means we have returned to shareholders 95% of the equity
raised since Melrose’s inception in 2003. At the same time as the
return of capital shares in issue were reduced by means of a share
consolidation. Notwithstanding this repayment of capital, Melrose had
year end net cash of £32.4 million, compared with net debt of
£162.6 million at the end of last year.
In such an active year it would be easy to overlook the strong
performances of our continuing businesses. All three divisions have
bettered their results of last year, and although MVC continues to
trade in a very difficult market place in the USA, we are optimistic that
this overall improvement will continue into 2008. Cash generation
remains very strong.
David Roper reports in more detail on each of our businesses in his
Chief Executive’s review.
Dividends
The Board intends to propose a final dividend of 4.25p per share
(together with an interim dividend of 2.5p per share paid on 
16 November 2007, a total of 6.75p per share) (2006: 6.0p 
per share) at the Annual General Meeting on 7 May 2008. The
dividend is payable on 16 May 2008 to shareholders on the register
at 14 March 2008.
Strategy and outlook
Our model is to acquire businesses which we understand and which
are capable of substantial improvement under our ownership. It is an
important part of this model that we return capital to shareholders as
and when value has been created and realised. We are pleased to
have been able to give an effective demonstration of this during 2007.
I said last September that we were well placed to pursue suitable
acquisitions and that market conditions were potentially aiding us 
in this respect. That continues to be the case and we are optimistic 
of concluding one or more acquisitions in the next twelve months
which will give us the opportunity for substantial further growth 
and profitability.

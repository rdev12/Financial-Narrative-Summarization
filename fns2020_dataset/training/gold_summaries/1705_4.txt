What we do
The group has two core businesses. 
Axeon Technologies creates and 
licences advanced engine control 
and diagnostics technology for the 
automotive and industrial markets. Its 
key products are neural network parallel 
processing microprocessors which can 
be embedded in automotive engine 
controller units, and the related design 
tools and intellectual property arising 
therefrom. These products are branded 
under the Vindax name. Axeon Power 
designs, sources cells for and assembles 
Li-ion battery packs for the portable 
device, mobility and automotive markets.
The group’s key customers are the 
automotive and chip manufacturers, 
and the manufacturers of portable 
and mobile products requiring power 
supplies. The main benefits of the 
group’s technologies are reduced 
system costs, improved fuel and 
power efficiency and reduced  
carbon emissions.
Where we operate
Axeon’s head office is in Aberdeen 
where the initial technology was 
developed and 12 employees, mainly 
from the electronics design and 
function development teams of Axeon 
Technologies, are based. 
 
Our Dundee site is home to the 21 
employees in Axeon Power working  
on battery pack design and assembly.
In addition there are 2 staff in Frankfurt, 
Germany and a presence in Detroit, 
USA who handle customer liaison in 
these key global automotive centres.
Who we are
Axeon was founded in 1998 by Hamish 
Grant the Chief Executive Officer. The 
group is run by a board of 7 directors 
who blend strong industry specific and 
public company experience. In addition 
to Hamish there are two executive 
directors and four non-executives 
including Charles Matthews the 
chairman. A further 6 senior individuals 
along with the executive directors form 
the overall management team sharing 
leading industry experience between 
them. The total headcount of the group 
is currently 35.
Where we’re going
In June 2005 Axeon completed 
one of its short-term business goals 
– securing a listing on the London Stock 
Exchange’s junior market, AIM. This 
milestone brings access to new capital 
markets, working capital and increased 
profile. It gives a strong platform 
from which the group can achieve 
the growth and profitability to match 
the vision and ambitions of the board 
from providing products to the highest 
level in global automotive and other 
targeted markets. The ambitions of the 
founders of the group are reflected in 
today’s management and employees. 
The group’s vision and arena is a  
global one.
Key events 2005/2006 Misfire detection
Engine misfire is the lack of 
combustion in the cylinder due to 
e.g. absence of spark, poor fuel 
metering or poor compression. 
Misfires result in un-combusted or 
partially combusted fuel gases being 
released into the exhaust system, 
increasing pollution levels from the 
engine and permanently damaging 
the catalytic converter. Because of this, 
environmental agencies require all 
gasoline-fuelled vehicles to include a 
reliable misfire-detection system in the 
on-board diagnostics of their ECU.
Axeon has shown that Vindax is 
capable of reliably detecting misfires 
in engines with a large number of 
cylinders to the strict performance 
levels required by current and 
incoming legislation.
By using Vindax technology, this 
normally processor intensive task can 
be unloaded from the main processor 
of the engine control unit. In addition, 
Vindax has ample capacity for the 
task allowing other suitable engine 
diagnostic or management tasks 
to run on the same physical Vindax 
implementation.

Our products
Axeon Technologies’ range of 
Vindax products includes: the Vindax 
processor architecture, implemented 
as a fully synthesisable IP core; the 
Vindax development system (VDS), 
the key tool in developing solutions 
using Vindax technology; and the 
Vindax S-Function and dSPACE 
tools which allow simulations of the 
developed solutions to be tested 
and updated in real-time within the 
original problem environment. 
Axeon Power provides a turnkey 
service from Li-ion battery pack 
design through supply chain 
management and volume assembly, 
with a key competence in the 
design of the battery management 
electronics. Battery packs are 
supplied for a wide range of products 
from handheld devices through 
mobility and utility vehicles to larger 
commercial vehicles.
Typical product applications
Battery package supply
In April 2006 Axeon Power signed an 
agreement with Modec to become 
the exclusive supplier of its battery 
management systems, battery 
cassettes and charging stations for its 
new zero emission city delivery van.
  
Initially Axeon will supply battery 
cassettes using Sodium Nickel Chloride 
cells and are developing a Lithium Ion 
(‘Li-ion’) alternative for introduction 
next year. Both battery chemistries 
provide more than three times the 
energy density of traditional lead acid 
batteries, enabling the Modec vehicles 
to carry 2 tonnes for up to 100 miles at 
speeds of up to 50mph. 
  
Modec were looking to keep their 
number of suppliers to a manageable 
level and selected Axeon Power 
to look after their battery package 
requirements for delivery to 
production line after a European 
search for partners.

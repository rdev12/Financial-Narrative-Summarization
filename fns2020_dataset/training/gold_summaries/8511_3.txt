 CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I stated in the Annual Report for 2006, that 
we intended to capitalise on our leading 
position in the London office fit out market by 
pursuing an acquisition strategy which would 
diversify the business by activity, sector and 
by region. These results demonstrate the 
benefits of this strategy. Over this period, 
the contribution from our businesses outside 
London has risen from 11% to 57% of group 
trading operating profit.
To achieve this, the group has moved in 
three strategic directions: firstly to provide 
to our global office fit out customers a wider 
geographic service through Europe, the 
Middle East and Asia, secondly to establish a 
national retail and leisure fit out business and 
thirdly to widen and deepen our new build 
and refurbishment construction services to 
our UK customers outside of London. 
 
During the year we continued to consolidate 
further our position in a number of key 
markets. In the UK we acquired the Pearce 
Group in November 2007, which brought us 
a South West based regional construction 
business and a highly regarded national food 
retail fit out and refurbishment business.  
Overseas in September 2007, our European 
associate, Interior Alpha SA (IASA), became 
a wholly owned subsidiary. Both have made 
a substantial contribution to the group results 
in the period of ownership. With these and 
earlier acquisitions performing at or above 
our expectations, the delivery of our strategy 
has cushioned our performance from an over 
reliance on the London office fit out market.
We continue to seek acquisition and 
partnering opportunities overseas. Prior to  
the year end we announced the signing of 
Heads of Terms to form a 50:50 joint venture 
with the Al Habtoor Leighton Group, to 
provide fit out services across the Middle 
East region. Based in Dubai, they are one 
of the largest Middle East construction 
services groups. To support the group in the 
development of its international operations 
I was pleased to welcome Greg Aldridge 
to the Board in January 2008 as Corporate 
Development Director. Greg has worked 
in the City for many years, has extensive 
corporate finance experience and a long 
association with the group.
We are a service business and our success 
depends upon the dedication of our people 
and their willingness to subscribe to our 
culture of excellence, customer satisfaction, 
quality and safety. These results reflect their 
hard work and commitment at all levels in the 
group and I thank them.
THE GROUP’S DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGY OVER RECENT YEARS HAS HELPED DELIVER 
ANOTHER YEAR OF RECORD PROFITS, NOTWITHSTANDING THE CURRENT ECONOMIC 
UNCERTAINTY. PROFIT BEFORE TAX AND AMORTISATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR  
THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 2008 INCREASED TO £14.1M FROM £10.6M LAST YEAR. 
ADJUSTED BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE

 ROSE BY 21% FROM 29.9P TO 36.2P . THE BOARD 
IS PROPOSING A FINAL DIVIDEND OF 9.2P PER SHARE RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN THE 
TOTAL DIVIDEND OF NEARLY 15% TO 13.2P PER SHARE FROM 11.5P PER SHARE. We have ended the year with a number  
of major project wins, including the 
Velodrome for the 2012 Olympics and the 
fit out of KPMG’s new 400,000 sq ft UK 
headquarters building in Canary Wharf, so 
that our total order book at 30 June 2008 
has risen from £843m at the last year end to 
£1,051m, 70% of which is due for completion 
in the current year. Whilst prepared for further 
turbulence in the world economy, this gives 
us confidence that next year’s results  
should show further progress.

 Chief Executive’s 
Review
The TWo mos T imPor TaNT Words

John Anderson, Chief Executive Officer
888 is an industry-leading brand 
which is synonymous with quality, 
fairness and trust. As a business  
it has delivered a number of 
consecutive years of growth in 
Profits. 2005 was no exception, 
and we are delighted to report Profit 
after tax for the year excluding 
share benefit charges of US$65 
million, up 59% on 2004, a more 
than satisfactory increase.
Our flotation in October on the 
London Stock Exchange marked  
an important step in our goal to 
become the market leader in the 
global online gaming entertainment 
industry. This will enable us to 
increase further our brand profile, 
recognition and credibility and  
will also give us an acquisition 
currency. This is a key part of  
our strategy and we believe the 
industry has matured to a stage 
where consolidation is inevitable 
and I intend that 888 will be at  
the heart of this. Our industry  
has arrived and will be here on  
a permanent basis. 
The business is in great shape, 
and the year to 31 December 2005 
saw us achieve record Net Gaming 
Revenue and Profits. New member 
registrations in both Casino and 
Poker were significantly up at 
5.3 million.
The main driver behind our 
outstanding growth has been our 
in-depth knowledge and experience 
of the industry built up since our 
inception in 1997. We understand 
what our members want and we are 
continually upgrading our product 
offering to retain existing and 
attract new players. Most 
importantly, we continue to provide

12 members with a secure and trusted 
environment in which to play. In the 
interests of consumer protection, we 
were a founding member of eCOGRA, 
the pre-eminent industry benchmark 
and I am a member of its board.
Whilst member acquisition is key, 
member retention is paramount.  
As well as the products we offer, we 
have invested in the highest quality 
infrastructure and systems to ensure 
that we sustain our members’ interest 
and do not give them a reason to play 
anywhere else. We will continue to add 
new entertainment options through 
selective acquisition or in-house 
development and we will expand  
our software platforms to allow for 
increased scalability.
geographic spread
No business should have an over-
reliance on any one particular market 
and those in our industry are no 
exception. We don’t believe in having 
all our eggs in the one basket and I 
personally consider our geographic mix 
of business to be the widest in the 
industry. By making our product 
available in up to 11 languages we 
have grown our non-USA business  
at such a rate so as to reduce our 
dependence on the USA, to 55%  
of our business without sacrificing 
volume. Our second largest revenue 
stream comes from the UK market, 
representing 20% of our mix. In the 
UK, 888 has come from nowhere in 
2003 to become the top brand in the 
industry in 2005. This success is 
mainly due to the highly successful 
offline advertising campaigns we ran  
in the UK and high profile selected 
sponsorships. We will be repeating 
this strategy of awareness throughout 
mainland Europe in the coming year. 
our Product offering
During the year we have succeeded in 
growing Net Gaming Revenue and new 
player sign-ups across all our categories. 
In 2004 the total amount wagered in 
the online casino market was estimated 
at US$53.9 billion (source: CCA).
Since its inception in 1997 our Casino 
product, Casino-on-Net, has continued 
to be the leading online casino brand 
with member numbers now at a level 
of 4 million real money registered 
member accounts. 
2005 saw continued growth in Net 
Gaming Revenue from US$178 million  
to US$271 million, an increase of 52%. 
This is mainly attributable to the 
expansion of our online and offline 
marketing programmes and the 
introduction of new distribution channels 
through our affiliate programmes.
We also operate an additional Casino 
brand, Reef Club Casino, that we 
introduced in 2002. By offering 
members another Casino brand we 
optimise their choice which in turn 
underpins our member retention by 
keeping players on our sites.
In January 2006, 888 launched an 
entirely new Casino product with a new 
graphical user interface, new industry 
leading video-slot machines and 
promotion features to provide  
our members with an even more 
sophisticated visual and interactive 
No business should have an over-
reliance on any one particular 
market and those in our industry 
are no exception. We don’t believe 
in having all our eggs in the one 
basket and I personally consider 
our geographic mix of business to 
be the widest in the industry.
experience to enhance their playing 
environment. We also plan to add an 
additional language to our Casino in 
the first quarter of 2006. 
The online poker market has 
experienced remarkable growth since 
2002 and I have no doubt it is fast 
becoming a mainstream entertainment 
activity. Poker has always been played 
in the USA and in fact is part of the 
fabric of USA society. People of all ages, 
including families, have always played 
Poker as part of their recreational 
time. More and more countries 
throughout the globe are playing the 
game and this is resulting in a decline 
in the dominance of the USA market. 
Poker is cool and here to stay.
Our Poker product, Pacific Poker, was 
ranked four in 2005 and in the year, 
Net Gaming Revenue from our Poker 
business exhibited strong growth, 
increasing by 179% to US$109.8 
million (2004: US$39.3 million). This 
result partly reflects an increase in 
888’s marketing efforts but is also a 
by-product of the exponential growth of 
the phenomenon that is online poker.
We are continually upgrading our 
proprietary products and have recently 
upgraded our Poker offering with a multi-
language format. It is now operational in 
English, German, Italian and Swedish. 
We introduced a new e-wallet focusing 
on Spain, Germany, Netherlands, Italy 
and France, thereby expanding further 
our geographical presence in non-USA 
markets. 888 plans to roll-out a further 
two new languages and a new Jackpot 
feature for Pacific Poker in the first 
quarter of 2006.

Review
Betmate, our betting exchange, is a 
white label product in conjunction 
with Betdaq, the second largest 
betting exchange in the UK. It has 
been in operation since 2004 and 
acts as a member retention tool  
by complementing our Casino 
offerings. It offers access to a 
betting exchange for non-USA 
members only. It has performed 
satisfactorily over the period.
In order for us to give our members 
a “one stop shopping” experience 
we need to offer them a 
sportsbook. We are currently 
examining our options to achieve 
this. We will not take sports bets 
from US citizens, however we will 
take bets on American sports 
events from non-US citizens.
r egulatory developments
Whilst the application of existing 
laws to online gaming is still to be 
clarified in most jurisdictions, in 
April 2005 the UK Government 
passed the Gambling Act, which 
includes the licensing of online 
gaming. I believe the UK’s position 
is the first domino in what will 
become a legislative network 
throughout mainland Europe.
We continue to monitor the 
legislative position in the USA, 
where many attempts have been 
made in the past to prevent the 
instruments for the financial 
payment of internet gaming to take 
place. It is our view that this will 
continue to be our main challenge. 
We also monitor on a continual 
basis all jurisdictions to ensure 
we understand local regulatory 
positions and are alerted early to 
any potential developments. The 
world has still to get to grips with 
this industry and the laws which do 
exist can change very rapidly. Part of 
what we must do as an industry is to 
lobby all of the countries of the world 
so that legalisation and licensing of 
Internet gaming becomes the norm 
rather than the exception. 
innovative marketing approach
The 888 brand is a core aspect  
of our marketing strategy and is  
key to building and maintaining  
our business. Strong branding is 
not only critical in differentiating  
our business but a recognisable 
brand builds trust which is a  
key consideration affecting a 
consumer’s choice of provider.
Our marketing strategy includes both 
online advertising, such as search 
engine optimisation and offline 
activities. This includes mass media 
advertising, direct mail, sports 
marketing and sponsorship, such as 
that of Middlesbrough Football Club 
where our shirt sponsorship deal 
has been a huge success. Recently 
we also signed up to be the sponsor 
of the iconic World Snooker 
Championship. The event is held  
at the Crucible in Sheffield, UK and 
is the most important event in the 
snooker calendar. Our sponsorship 
not only catapults us into emerging 
markets such as China and the Far 
East, where snooker has a huge 
following, but our brand will be fully 
14 future Prospects
I have no doubt that this industry  
is here to stay and the market will 
continue to grow in line with increasing 
Internet penetration throughout the 
world. As stated at flotation, our goal 
is to become market leader and offer  
a “one stop shop” online leisure 
experience. This expansion will be 
achieved both organically and through 
selective acquisition. 
Our 2005 results confirm we are 
heading in the right direction to 
achieve this. We are confident that the 
continued focus on our strategic goals, 
through a systematic and evidence-
based approach, will provide the 
opportunities to deliver further positive 
results in the future.
The, albeit early, trends in 2006 
confirm our confidence in the future. 
This year we will expand into more 
countries with better products and  
we will continue to pursue excellence 
in every facet of our business.

exposed for hundreds of hours in the 
UK and Europe. We consider the deal  
to be a major step in continuing to 
spread global awareness of the 888 
brand. As part of this 888 will also be 
an associate sponsor of the Masters, 
Grand Prix and UK Championship 
snooker events.
member r elationship management
888 has a first class reputation for  
its member relationship management. 
Our member support is as international 
as our member base and we currently 
provide support in up to 11 languages, 
available 24/7. Our call centres offer 
interactive services and support toll-
free/free-phone numbers, email and 
web-chat platforms as well as online 
self-help options. Our staff are all highly 
trained and undergo an ongoing training 
programme to ensure we remain at the 
cutting edge of service excellence.
We have consistently focused on 
maintaining and enhancing our 
member support services and have 
developed a valuable proprietary 
member database of over 23 million 
registered members. We believe there 
is significant opportunity in both the 
cross-selling and up-selling of this 
database to maximise member 
retention and lifetime value. 
Payment systems
Payment systems are the lifeblood of 
our industry. The number of options we 
use has increased from four in 2000  
to 22 in 2005. We must continually 
upgrade and seek new systems in order 
to give all of our members in different 
markets local methods enabling them 
to pay and play seamlessly.
I cannot emphasise enough the 
importance of making available a  
wide variety of payment methods to 
support members in different locations 
and with different needs. This alone 
shatters the myth that barriers to  
entry to our industry are low. The fact 
is that barriers to successful entry are 
extremely high.
back-office support
Our proprietary back-office systems 
are state of the art and form an 
excellent base to keep our members 
satisfied. We spend a lot of money  
to attract new members and it is vital 
we create a service environment that 
keeps them.
People
Our people are totally dedicated and 
include many of the pioneers of the 
industry. They are not only good at 
what they do and have a tremendous 
track record but are focused on the 
future success of the Group. I would 
like to add my personal thanks to each 
one of our employees worldwide for 
what they have achieved in 2005.  
Our success is their success.
There is no doubt that this is an 
industry which is here to stay and 
the market will continue to grow 
in line with increasing Internet 
penetration.

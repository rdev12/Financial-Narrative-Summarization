 Proﬁt on ordinary activities before
taxation and exceptional items was
£246.0m (2004: £234.1m) and included a
contribution of £15.6m from our
acquisition of Stanley Leisure plc’s retail
betting operations (Stanley Retail) in
June 2005. Earnings per share excluding
exceptional items were 36.2p, broadly
level with 2004.
We continued to invest in our business
across all three channels. We invested in
the ongoing development of our estate,
the replacement of our text systems and
the installation of electronic point of sale
terminals (EPOS). In addition we
commenced a three-year programme to
update our core bookmaking systems.
As this progresses, our technology
infrastructure will improve signiﬁcantly
with a common architecture across our
business which will allow prices, results
and products to be distributed easily;
provide a consolidated risk
management capability and give our
customers a single account with which
to gamble across all channels.
In 2005, the Group’s sports betting
activities, in common with other
bookmakers, were adversely affected by
sporting results compared to generally
more favourable results in 2004. In
addition, the Group continued to
experience downward pressure on
theoretical margins on horseracing,
which we ﬁrst reported on in 2004. This
adverse trend was largely offset by
particularly strong performances in the
Fixed Odds Betting Terminal (FOBT) and
poker businesses. Operating expenses
were kept under tight control. 
Acquisition of Stanley Retail 
The acquisition of Stanley Retail was
completed on 18 June 2005 adding 624
LBOs to the existing William Hill estate.
The headline price for the acquisition
was £504m, which after a working
capital adjustment, professional fees
and stamp duty resulted in total cash
consideration of £506.6m.
Subject to William Hill providing
satisfactory undertakings, the OFT
decided not to refer the acquisition to
the Competition Commission. The
undertakings related to the disposal of
77 LBOs (and potentially another two
LBOs) out of the combined estate.
76 LBOs (64 Stanley Retail shops and
12 William Hill shops) have been sold to
the Tote for net consideration of
£34.4m.The LBOs sold to the Tote were
on average less proﬁtable than the rest
of the estate.
A dedicated multi-disciplinary team was
established to take control of Stanley
Retail and set about the task of
integrating the operation into the
enlarged William Hill Group.
Post OFT clearance, the Group started to
integrate the two businesses. Key tasks
included the harmonisation of products,
prices, and betting rules; progressive re-
branding of the shops; installation of the
same version of electronic point of sale
and audiovisual text systems recently
deployed in the William Hill estate; re-
negotiation of contracts with key
suppliers; and wind down of the Stanley
Retail head ofﬁce. We remain conﬁdent of
achieving synergies and other beneﬁts in
excess of the £13m that we estimated at
the time of the acquisition and we
believe that these could exceed £20m
over the medium term. Incremental
beneﬁts include a reduction in betting
tax in the Republic of Ireland from 2% to
1% of turnover from 1 July 2006; the
removal of pre-race data charges payable
to the British Horseracing Board in certain
jurisdictions following a judgment in the
Republic of Ireland; and beneﬁts arising
from a management restructure relating
to the combined retail estate.
Retail
The Retail division grew gross win by
13.7% to £623.4m (0.8% excluding
Stanley Retail) and proﬁt increased by
9.7% to £181.6m (0.3% excluding
Stanley Retail).
Excluding Stanley Retail, gross win on
over the counter (OTC) and amusement
with prizes machines (AWPs) fell by 6.9%
and 69.0%, respectively, but this was
compensated for by an increase in FOBT
gross win of 33.5%. 
In the William Hill estate total gross win
declined 1.3% and increased 3.3% in the
ﬁrst and second half years, respectively,
against the comparative periods.
LBOs in the Stanley Retail estate
performed better year-on-year than
those in the original William Hill estate in
the period from their acquisition
through to the year end. The pattern of a
reduction in OTC and AWP gross win and
an increase in FOBT gross win was also
seen in Stanley Retail. 
The average number of FOBTs in the
William Hill estate increased to 5,892 in
the period (2004: 4,442). We ﬁnished the
year with 6,078 FOBTs (2004: 5,573) in
the William Hill estate and 1,613 FOBTs
in the Stanley estate. The average net
proﬁt per machine per week in the
William Hill estate was £402 (2004: £373)
for the year and in the Stanley Retail
estate was £293 for the period since its
acquisition. The improved proﬁtability in
the William Hill estate was mainly due to
better contractual terms with our main
FOBT supplier Leisure Link effective from
May 2005.
The number of AWPs in the William Hill
estate at the end of the year was 276
(2004: 530) and the average number
traded in the period fell from 1,392 in
2004 to 353 in 2005. In Stanley Retail,
there were 335 AWPs at the end of the
year.
Costs in the channel were up 17.0%
(1.5% excluding Stanley Retail).
Excluding Stanley Retail, there were
savings in staff costs due to reduced
overtime and premium payments under
the new employment contracts with
shop staff and productivity
improvements resulting from the
investment in EPOS. FOBT rentals fell
due to more favourable contractual
terms, which are exclusively royalty
based, and AWP rentals fell due to the
reduction in the number of machines in
the estate. These savings were offset by
increases in rent and rates due to
increased shop numbers and rent
reviews; energy costs; communications
costs incurred to provide EPOS
infrastructure; picture and data costs
due to additional shop numbers,
increased charges from SIS and the
number of LBOs showing Sky Sports;
and depreciation and maintenance
charges as a result of introducing new
text and EPOS systems.
We completed 138 development and
shop ﬁtting projects during the year
including 31 new licences, 53 extensions
and resites and 54 shopﬁttings. We
spent £23m on estate development in
the year.
At the end of the year we had 2,121
LBOs in the United Kingdom, 9 in the
Channel Islands, 2 in the Isle of Man and
52 in the Republic of Ireland; a total of
2,184. 
We completed the installation of a new
text system and an EPOS system in the

Chief Executive’s Review
William Hill PLC - Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Chief Executive’s Review William Hill estate in the year with
minimal disruption and extended the
rollout of the same systems to the
Stanley Retail estate. The total cash
investment in respect of these projects is
expected to be £53m.
Telephone
Telephone gross win fell by 11.4% to
£53.4m and proﬁt fell by 41.2% to
£13.0m. This channel is the most
vulnerable to adverse sporting results
and the decline in theoretical
horseracing betting margins as its
higher staking customers tend to back a
higher proportion of favourites and are
less likely to recycle winnings.
There was a fall in gross win against the
comparative period in both the ﬁrst and
second half of 2005, although the fall in
the second half was less pronounced
than in the ﬁrst half.
Costs in this channel were up 10.9% due
to increases in bank charges and a
higher allocation of central technology
costs.
We ended the year with 174,000 active
telephone customers (2004: 184,000).
Interactive 
Interactive gross win increased 16.2% to
£123.3m and proﬁt grew 18.4% to
£61.2m.
Growth in gross win was seen across all
products with the strongest growth in
poker, which increased 90%. Sportsbook
gross win grew despite adverse sporting
results, on the back of an increase in
turnover and active accounts. Our
arcade experienced strong growth and
the casino showed a small increase in
gross win. 
In October 2004 we launched William
Hill TV (WHTV) on Sky Channel 425.
Gross win generated through the
interactive games arcade remains low.
However, we have seen an increase in
stakes placed through the Interactive
and Telephone sportsbooks on
greyhound racing shown live on
Channel 425. We have commenced a
trial broadcast of Channel 425 content
into our betting shops and we hope that
this will increase shop gross win as well
as draw shop punters to interactive
television outside shop hours. We will
evaluate the beneﬁts of Channel 425 in
mid 2006.
Gross win grew against the comparative
periods in both the ﬁrst and second half
years of 2005 and the growth achieved
in the second half was just below that
achieved in the ﬁrst half. Betting grew at
4.6% in the ﬁrst half and 15.6% in the
second half and gaming (casino and
poker) grew at 30.9% in the ﬁrst half and
15.3% in the second half. 
We continue to expand our range of in
running betting opportunities and
launched a live betting console on our
sportsbook, which enables the rapid
update of prices during play. We
enhanced our single account
proposition and Interactive and
Telephone customers can now bet on
sports, poker, casino, and arcade from a
single wallet. We launched 5 new arcade
games that expanded our offering to 10
games. Our mobile sportsbook service is
supported on the majority of WAP
enabled handsets.
We upgraded our poker product
through our partner Cryptologic and
they now have the ﬁfth largest poker
room on the internet. As a result, our
players compete for over $3.5m in
guaranteed tournament prize pools
each month. Players can also qualify for
the World Series of Poker and European
Poker Tour events. William Hill continues
to build its poker brand and is the ofﬁcial
sponsor of the European Poker
Rankings. The ﬁnals of the William Hill
Grand Prix attracted top players from
around the world with a prize pool of
£450,000. The ﬁnals are being broadcast
on Sky television.
As part of our international strategy we
launched a Greek language poker room
to complement our Greek download
and instant casinos. 
We added 31 new games to our Boss
and Cryptologic download casinos,
including 6 Marvel Comic themed
games targeted at the slot machine
market and blackjack and roulette
variants aimed at the European market.
We now offer over 140 games and paid
out over £750,000 in shared progressive
jackpots in 2005.
Total active accounts increased to
341,000 as at 27 December 2005 (28
December 2004: 292,000).
Costs in the channel increased 20.7%
due to increased marketing activities
to support the growth of our poker
business and to fund the costs of
Channel 425 production and content. 
Cost of content
In July 2005 the Court of Appeal agreed
with the European Court of Justice (ECJ)
interpretation of the Database Directive,
which had previously been referred to
the ECJ by the Court of Appeal in
relation to our dispute with the BHB on
the use of certain racing data. This
judgment supported the Group’s
position. Subsequently, the BHB has
decided not to challenge this judgment
thus bringing to an end the dispute that
commenced in 2001.
Had the BHB been successful, their
database would have been the basis of
a commercial deal between racing and
betting that would have allowed the
statutory levy scheme to end. As a result

William Hill PLC - Annual Report & Accounts 2005 Chief Executive’s Review
of the decision, the Government has
extended the statutory levy until 2009
and appointed a committee, under the
chairmanship of Lord Donoughue,
to ﬁnd an alternative basis for a
commercial arrangement. The
committee issued its draft report in
December 2005. It is anticipated that
discussion will take place between
interested parties during 2006 in order
to assess whether a viable alternative to
the current statutory levy can be
developed from the options identiﬁed
by the committee.
The betting industry has contractual
arrangements in place with the
country’s 59 racetracks for the supply of
horseracing pictures into LBOs. These
contracts expire between spring 2007
and summer 2009.
With regard to football, the Retail
division continues to make payments to
the football authorities as part of an
ongoing agreement. It should be noted
that at the same time as delivering its
judgment on the interpretation of the
Database Directive in relation to
horseracing, the ECJ took a similar line
on three football related cases. We are
still in discussion with the football
authorities concerning future
arrangements for LBOs, as well as
remote channels.
In November 2005 the BHB settled a
long running dispute with Irish
bookmakers over data rights. The
settlement came during a hearing in
Dublin’s Commercial Court and allowed
the BHB to keep the £30m it had
collected from Irish bookmakers since
March 2001. However the BHB accepted
that no further payments under the
previous contract would be made after
9 January 2006. Accordingly, from that
date, William Hill has ceased to make
any payment to the BHB in respect of
horseracing betting in its LBOs in
certain jurisdictions. Previously the
Company had paid 10% of gross win
arising from betting on UK horseracing
in LBOs outside of Great Britain.
Operating costs
Full year expenses for the Group were
£418.2m an increase of 26.6% (5.5%
excluding Stanley Retail and
exceptional costs).
Excluding Stanley Retail and
exceptional costs, staff costs, which
represented roughly half of our total
costs, fell 1.2% reﬂecting the
introduction of our new stafﬁng
contract in the retail estate and
improvement in productivity as a result
of the rollout of EPOS. Property costs,
which represented 16.0% of our total
costs, were up 10.9% over the
comparable period reﬂecting increases
in rent and rates in part driven by an
increase in average shop size and an
increase in the number of shops, and
higher energy costs. Depreciation and
equipment maintenance costs
increased 21.2% with the rollout of
EPOS and text systems along with the
supporting technology, although this
was offset by staff cost savings. The cost
of providing pictures and data to our
LBOs was up 8.5% over the comparable
period due to the size of the estate and
price increases. Advertising and
marketing costs, including the cost of
casino bonus cash payments that are
expensed in arriving at gross proﬁt,
were up 19.5% over the comparable
period reﬂecting increased web
advertising and promotions, in
particular focusing on poker and WHTV.
Other cost increases relate to our
investments in WHTV and our ongoing
investment in information technology,
EPOS capabilities and core bookmaking
systems. All expenditure on information
technology is subject to rigorous cost-
beneﬁt analysis, and tightly managed
through formalised project and
programme management systems.
Exceptional costs of £26.9m were
incurred in 2005 of which £19.0m
(including £5.4m of non-cash charges)
related to the integration of Stanley
Retail within the William Hill estate,
£3.0m related to the aborted return of
capital exercise and £7.4m related to
the installation of EPOS and text
systems. A proﬁt of £2.5m was recorded
on the disposal of 12 William Hill LBOs.
Regulatory development
In April 2005 the new Gambling Act was
enacted. We are advised that it is
unlikely to be fully implemented before
Autumn 2007 pending the setting up of
the Gambling Commission.
Proposed deregulation including
extended betting shop opening hours,
the installation of higher payout
gaming machines and the removal of
the demand criteria will impact our
estate. The new Act also opens up the
possibility of a UK based remote
gaming industry and over the next two
years the Government aims to establish
both regulatory and taxation regimes to
enable this to occur. We will continue to
work with our trade associations to
assist the Gambling Commission to
develop appropriate regulation.
Capital structure
William Hill was listed on the London
Stock Exchange in June 2002 and at
that time the Group put in place a
capital structure and ﬁnancing
arrangements to provide the optimum
capital structure for William Hill as a
public company, consistent with the
Board’s strategy. Since ﬂotation, William
Hill’s strong ﬁnancial performance has
led the Board to conclude that William
Hill could support a signiﬁcantly higher
amount of debt and to do so would be
in the interest of shareholders. In March
2005 the Company announced a return
of capital to shareholders of £453m and
a £40m additional contribution to the
Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension
scheme to address the actuarial deﬁcit
in the scheme.
In light of the acquisition of Stanley
Retail, the Company decided not to
proceed with the return of capital but
secured new facilities of £1.2bn in order
to fund the acquisition, reﬁnance the
facilities put in place at ﬂotation and
make a £47m additional contribution to
the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension
scheme over a ﬁve-year period.
Subsequent to receiving clearance from
the OFT on the Stanley Retail
acquisition, the Board gave further
consideration to the appropriate
ﬁnancing arrangements for the
enlarged Group. In September 2005, the
Board announced it will target a ratio of
net debt to earnings before exceptional
items, interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation (EBITDA) of approximately
3.5 times to be achieved over the
medium term. The Board also
announced that consistent with this
target it expected to return £200m –
£300m within an 18 month period. By
the end of 2005, £78.3m had been
returned by means of on-market share
buy-backs.
Taxation
In its Pre-Budget Report on 5 December
2005, HM Treasury announced the
conclusions it had reached on gambling
taxation. HM Treasury concluded that current tax arrangements are generally
working well at present and that
maintaining stability in the overall
structure of taxation is desirable in a
period of transition. In these
circumstances the Government decided
to maintain the current tax regimes
which are working well for betting,
betting exchanges, lottery and bingo.
Gross proﬁt tax
HM Treasury concluded that gross proﬁt
tax has been a success and the
Government has decided not to increase
the rate of gross proﬁt tax or make any
changes to it at this time.
Betting exchanges
The Government concluded that the
fairest way to tax betting exchanges is to
tax commission earned by them. It also
concluded that taxing layers on
exchanges, purely on the basis that they
lay bets, would not be fair or
proportionate. On this basis it
concluded that the current taxation
arrangements remain appropriate.
As a result of the Government’s decision
we expect to see continued pressure on
theoretical margins and to address in
part this issue we recently started to
hedge directly into betting exchanges as
a means of improving the effectiveness
of our hedging activities. In addition, the
Starting Price Regulatory Commission
(SPRC) is undertaking an independent
review of how starting prices are formed.
The SPRC has appointed
PricewaterhouseCoopers to conduct a
full review of the process and is expected
to announce its ﬁndings in the early
summer.
FOBTs
FOBTs were classiﬁed as gaming
machines for VAT purposes from 6
December 2005. From this date, income
earned from these machines is subject
to VAT rather than gross proﬁts tax. This
is in line with other types of gaming
machine.
From the 2006 Budget, AMLD will be
payable in addition to VAT and further
discussions are taking place between
the Government and the gambling
industry prior to the rate being set. 
Remote gaming
HM Treasury announced that in order to
align taxation policy with the Gambling
Act 2005, remote gaming will be
brought into the gambling duty net,
with the intention of announcing the
rate in the 2006 Budget. HM Treasury
has committed to further discussion
with the industry and other stakeholders
prior to announcing the rate.
Republic of Ireland
In December 2005 the Irish Government
announced a reduction in the tax rate
from 2% to 1% of turnover, to apply
from 1 July 2006. 
Pension plan
The Board undertook during the year to
make a special contribution of £47m to
the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt scheme. The
contribution will be spread over a
period of ﬁve years and is designed to
eliminate the deﬁcit calculated on a
continuing basis by the actuary as at
September 2004. The ﬁrst payment of
£9.4m was made in October 2005. The
Board and pension scheme Trustee have
consulted on this speciﬁc proposal and
believe it represents an appropriate
course of action that properly balances
the legitimate interests of shareholders,
members and pensioners.
Future capital structure and
dividend policy
The Board intends to maintain an
efﬁcient and ﬂexible capital structure
and will use a combination of dividend
payments and share buy-backs to
achieve this objective.
For 2006, the Board expects to maintain
dividend cover on a per share basis
broadly in line with the level in 2005. In
addition, the Board will be seeking
authority from shareholders for a
renewal of the on-market share buy-
back mandate.

REPORT
Delivering on target in 2012
EnQuest executed well in 2012 with 
production of 22,802 Boepd, which 
was above the mid-point of our 
guidance range. This was due to a 
successful 14 well drilling programme 
in 2012, including ve production wells 
brought onstream. In the three years 
since our inception, we have built a 
strong technically focused organisation 
that has generated signi cant levels of 
production and cash ow.
Amjad Bseisu
Chief Executive
In 2012, cash ow generated 
from operations was 59 .9 
million and EBITDA was 
 626.2 million. A net .7% 
increase in the average realised 
oil price helped EnQuest to 
achieve a pro t before tax and 
net nance costs of 405.1 
million, .8% up on 2011.

 EnQuest PLC
 Annual Report 2012
Audited net 2 reserves at the end of 2012 were 128.5 MMboe, 
an increase of 11.5% on 2011, even with the farm out of Alma/
Galia. EnQuest achieved a strong reserves replacement ratio of 
262.2% in 2012. This reserves growth re ects positive increases 
at our existing producing elds, as well as reserves relating to 
our 20% direct interest in Kraken.
Execution of the Alma/Galia development made signi cant 
progress, with the successful batch drilling of six wells and 
with the modi cations to the EnQuest roducer vessel well 
underway. A major proportion of the subsea infrastructure work 
was successfully carried out during 2012. The farm out of 5% of 
Alma/Galia was also achieved during the year, recognising the 
signi cant value being generated by the project.
In 2012, EnQuest acquired 60% of the Kraken discovery; 
potentially one of the largest new oil eld developments in the 
UK North Sea since Buzzard. EnQuest took over as operator in 
September 2012 and has deployed the same integrated project 
development capabilities utilised on Alma/Galia. The submission 
of the Kraken Field Development lan FD ’ is expected in 
Q2 201 .
EnQuest’s strategy
EnQuest’s development and production focused strategy 
continues to be implemented successfully; reserves and 
production growth have been delivered above target. rogress 
on the Alma/Galia development and on the new Kraken 
development is demonstrating our ability to execute and to 
bring new elds onstream. The farm out of 5% of Alma/Galia, 
with the 175.9 million gain on disposal that it generated, was 
material evidence of EnQuest’s success in turning opportunities 
into value; both the Alma/Galia and the Kraken projects 
demonstrate that EnQuest is increasingly a natural partner of 
choice for major integrated development projects in the UK 
North Sea.
The UK North Sea continues to have very signi cant 
opportunities, with over 00 undeveloped elds remaining. 
In 2012, EnQuest also announced its rst steps outside the UK 
North Sea. EnQuest has prequali ed as an operator in Norway. 
We have also established a presence in Malaysia. We acquired 
NIO etroleum Sabah Limited, which owns 42.5% in Blocks 
SB 07 and SB 08 offshore Sabah. The opportunity for EnQuest 
in Malaysia is similar to the UK North Sea, where EnQuest can 
establish development solutions for existing discoveries as well 
as taking over mature elds no longer material for the major 
oil companies.
Our Company our people
The breadth and depth of EnQuest’s teams, their proven skills 
in engineering, subsurface, execution and operations, their 
leadership in innovative integrated developments, are all key to 
our success. articularly critical is EnQuest’s in-house ability to 
understand the subsurface and to be able to integrate this fully 
with all the required facilities elements. EnQuest seeks to be the 
operator of its developments and elds; through operatorship 
and majority working interests, we exercise a level of control 
which allows us to take full advantage of our technical skills and 
operational scale.
By the end of 2012, EnQuest’s direct workforce had grown to 
approximately 500 people, in excess of four times the level at 
the time of our I O. As an integral part of EnQuest’s recent 
establishment of a presence in both Norway and Malaysia, we 
now have small experienced senior teams in place in Stavanger 
and in Kuala Lumpur. 
Health safety environment and assurance ( HSE A’)
HSE&A is our top priority and HSE&A is deeply embedded in 
our culture and values. It is the most critical aspect of how we 
manage the business, with regard to our people themselves and 
to our installations and the environment in which we operate. 
Exhibiting leadership in safety is key and we seek continuous 
improvement in our HSE&A performance.
Good levels of performance in HSE&A have continued, with 
EnQuest achieving top quartile performance in several of key 
HSE&A K Is. This included a ve year Lost Time Incident free 
 LTI’ free milestone for the Thistle drill rig, particularly impressive 
given its high level of activity. EnQuest also achieved a signi cant 
reduction in hydrocarbon releases across our assets.
Operations
EnQuest drilled 14 wells in 2012, successfully delivering the Thistle 
and Dons drilling programmes, together with the subsequent 
increase in production. In addition, EnQuest successfully 
progressed the installation of the new turbine power generator on 
Thistle which will deliver the power generation capability to sustain 
high levels of water injection uptime.
The Alma/Galia development
In 2012, EnQuest received the approval of the Department 
of Energy and Climate Change DECC’ for the Alma and 
Galia developments. EnQuest secured Alma/Galia through 
the 26th Licensing Round in 2010, extending the life of the 
 rst North Sea oil eld to come into production.

In February 201 , EnQuest announced an increase in reserves 
and also in the scope and speci cation of the Alma/Galia 
development. The additional scope extends the eld life, 
optimises operating costs and enables a potential second 
phase of development. Gross project capital expenditure 
is now approximately 1. billion, including contingency. 
These changes should extend the life of the F SO vessel, 
to up to 15 years, and will allow additional wells in any second 
development phase. With the extended eld life, the gross 
 eld 2 reserves are increased from 29 MMboe to 4 MMboe. 
This relates only to the existing rst phase of development. 
The net effect of the capital cost increases, the bene t of the 
reserves increase and the operational improvements to the 
project, is a positive increase in the net present value overall; 
the improvements also create the potential for additional 
reserves and value in a potential second phase. We remain 
on track for rst oil in Q4 201 . 
Kraken – a major development in the North Sea
In 2012, EnQuest acquired the right to 60% of the Kraken 
oil discovery and became the operator of the proposed 
development. We are enthusiastic about Kraken, and anticipate 
it becoming a key part of EnQuest’s asset base.
Kraken is anticipated to have a long eld life and therefore a 
production pro le that complements shorter life elds such as 
the Don elds and Alma/Galia. Along with Alma/Galia, Kraken 
should help to secure EnQuest’s medium term production and 
reserves growth.
EnQuest’s execution team is leading the development, utilising 
its integrated project development capabilities. FD submission 
is expected in Q2 201 and rst oil is targeted in 2016.
Near eld and low cost exploration and appraisal
EnQuest’s exploration and appraisal strategy is focused on low 
cost and near eld opportunities. In 2012 EnQuest participated 
in two such wells. One was Tryfan, a non-operated well which 
had signi cant potential, but proved to be uncommercial. As 
anticipated, the Kildrummy appraisal well results showed an oil 
column which was thicker than previously discovered in that 
 eld. Analysis of the commerciality of various potential 
Kildrummy development options is ongoing.
Business development
In 2012, EnQuest further consolidated its existing asset positions 
and built new ones. Operated oil eld development asset 
opportunities in the UKCS require signi cant skills and capabilities 
as well as nancial strength. EnQuest is selective and rigorous in 
its approach, always starting with the fundamentally important 
subsurface analysis, which is carried out in-house.
In Q1 2012, we agreed the acquisition of a further 18.5% working 
interest in West Don, increasing our interest to a majority 6 .45%. 
During H1 2012, in three separate tranches, we agreed the 
acquisition of an aggregate interest of 60% in the Kraken oil 
discovery, the rst tranche for a xed sum and the second two 
tranches via development carries. During 2012 EnQuest also 
increased its interest in the Kildrummy discovery from 40% to 60%.
–CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S
REPORT CONTINUED 19
 EnQuest PLC
 Annual Report 2012
EnQuest has continued to build its interest in the Cairngorm 
discovery; having acquired 100% of Block 16/2b of Cairngorm 
through the acquisition of Stratic Energy Corporation in 2010. 
We successfully applied for 50% of Block 16/ d, in the UK’s 26th 
Licensing Round and in December 2012, EnQuest took on the 
ownership of the whole of the Cairngorm discovery. This was 
achieved by completing the acquisition of the remaining 50% 
of Block 16/ d through a swap arrangement in exchange for 
non-core assets which EnQuest owned in Holland.
EnQuest also agreed a small disposal in December 2012, selling 
a Dutch asset, licence 8 Horizon West , to Van Dyke Energy 
for a  million initial cash consideration, plus  million 
contingent on future production.
Finally, in October 2012, EnQuest was pleased to have been 
offered 11 licences in the UK’s 27th Licensing Round.
Another strong nancial performance
In 2012, EBITDA was again strong at 626.2 million, a similar level 
to the 629.1 million generated in 2011. This re ected the .7% 
year on year increase in the realised oil price and also the .5% 
expected decline in production. Underlying operational 
performance was strong.
EnQuest continues to have a strong balance sheet, ending the 
year with an 89.9 million positive net cash position. Capital 
expenditure on property, plant and equipment oil and gas assets 
was 802.9 million in 2012. Capital investment on bringing Alma/
Galia towards rst oil in Q4 201 , amounted to 421. million, 
including 86.7 million in relation to the carry element of the 
project. The 184. million 2012 investment programme at 
Thistle contributed to the 48.2% increase in its production during 
2012. Other elements of the 2012 capex programme included; 
 54.0 million at Heather/Broom, 128.8 million on the Don and 
Conrie elds, and 26.0 million on preparatory work at Kraken.
The unit cost of sales production and transportation was 
 2. per Boe in 2012, similar to the 1.9 per Boe in 2011, despite 
the impact of reduced production, higher oil prices and general 
upward pressure on market levels of operating costs. This good 
result re ects EnQuest’s focus on control of costs.
2013 highlights so far
In anuary 201 , EnQuest announced that it had agreed to acquire 
an 8% non-operated interest in the producing Alba oil eld, in the 
UK North Sea, adding reserves and producing barrels and further 
diversifying EnQuest’s asset base. This transaction completed in 
late March 201 .
Tell us why the Heather 
return to drilling project is 
such a milestone for the 
platform
2013 marks the 40th anniversary of 
the discovery of the Heather eld 
and 35 years of production. Twice in 
her life Heather faced the prospect 
of decommissioning, and EnQuest’s 
Return to Drilling (R2D2) project is 
designed to extend eld life to 
around 2030.
The prime objective of the upgrade 
project is to provide an enhanced 
drilling facility in preparation for a 
comprehensive drilling programme, 
and the team has already identi ed 
many innovative project solutions.
Work is still to be completed, but 
great progress has been made so far 
thanks to the teamwork, creativity 
and collaboration shown by EnQuest 
and our core contractors.

BUSINESS REVIEW
In Q1 201 , EnQuest successfully raised 145 million from the 
issue of a retail bond, with a 5.5% coupon and a 2022 maturity. 
We were pleased, both to have been the rst oil company to 
launch a retail bond on the London Stock Exchange’s Order 
Book for Retail Bonds and also that the issue was one of the 
largest raised in the market. This bond allows EnQuest to 
diversify its funding base and extend the tenor of its borrowings 
and complements our already strong balance sheet.
In Q1 201 , EnQuest also sanctioned the next phase of the 
Thistle life extension project, facilitated by its quali cation for 
the brown eld allowance programme, announced by the UK 
Government late in 2012. Thistle is a prime example of how 
EnQuest is able to recover more oil from maturing assets 
through a combination of innovation and technical expertise. 
Outlook for 2013 and beyond
Average production guidance for the full year 201 is between 
22,000 Boepd and 27,000 Boepd, as approximately 1,000 
Boepd has been lost, primarily due to third party shutdowns 
of the Brent pipeline in Q1 201 . In addition to rst oil from  
Alma/Galia, production improvements will come from three 
production wells in our existing producing elds; one new 
production well on Don Southwest, one well coming back 
onstream as a result of a workover on Heather, and another new 
well on Thistle. In total in 201 , EnQuest plans to deliver 12 wells. 
This includes three exploration/appraisal wells, with one each at 
both Cairngorm and Kraken and a further exploration/appraisal 
well is expected to be drilled in Malaysia in late 201 .
Why are you considering 
potential opportunities 
in Norway Entering the Norwegian market is a 
sensible step for EnQuest as it seeks 
to expand internationally. The geology 
in the Norwegian North Sea is very 
similar to that in the U CS. The 
extensive skill set we have within the 
Company is transferable and we 
already have a small team working out 
of Stavanger.
Norway provides an ideal opportunity 
to replicate our existing business 
model of targeting undeveloped 
assets with near eld appraisal and 
exploration prospects.

 Annual Report 2012
EnQuest’s total investment programme in 201 , prior to 
regulatory approval of the Kraken FD , is expected to be 
approximately 750 million, with around 50 million to be 
invested in the Alma/Galia development. In addition to the wells 
programme and the Alma/Galia development work, other major 
projects will also contribute to reserves and production in 201 
and will provide a foundation for future reserves and production 
growth. At Thistle, these include the next phase of the late life 
extension project and the delivery of a secure new power supply 
through the completion and commissioning of the new 0 MW 
gas turbine generator. In Q 201 , following the successful rig 
reactivation programme, Heather will return to drilling for the 
 rst time since 2006.
We continue to target submission of the Kraken FD in Q2 201 . 
 re-development expenditure of around 75 million for Kraken 
is included in the Group’s 201 investment programme of 750 
million; this pre-development expenditure includes the costs of 
the Kraken appraisal well, being drilled to provide additional data 
for the main development. The 201 Kraken expenditure will 
depend on phasing, particularly near to the year end, as well 
as potential spending on long lead items.

At the end of 2012, including the licences it was offered in the 
UK 27th Licensing Round, EnQuest had 9 production licences 
covering 55 blocks or part blocks, up from 22 production licences 
at the end of 2011. In addition to the current producing elds, 
EnQuest is actively considering new development proposals on 
at least three of its other licences. EnQuest has a strong discovery 
portfolio within its existing asset base and anticipates it will further 
consolidate these positions and continue to build new ones. 
EnQuest’s net 2 reserves at the start of 201 have a life of over 
15 years, extending to over 25 years if Kraken contingent resources 
can be converted into reserves.
With our centre of excellence and capability in Aberdeen, 
we will continue to take advantage of EnQuest’s integrated 
appraisal, development and operations model, both on 
our existing asset base and on new basins with mature and 
undeveloped eld potential.

Chairman’s statement
Chairman Phil White in discussion with chief executive Paul Sheffield  5
i am pleased to report strong results for Kier Group 
plc for the year ended 30 June 2010. underlying 
profit before tax, before the amortisation of intan-
gible assets and exceptional items, grew 10.6% 
to £58.4m (2009: £52.8m); and earnings per 
share on the same basis grew 18.3% to 121.3p 
(2009: 102.5p) enhanced by a 6% reduction in the 
effective tax rate. Overall revenue remained solid at 
£2,098.7m (2009: £2,145.6m) with marginal growth 
in uK construction revenues offset by a reduction 
in overseas construction revenues together with 
growth in revenue in each of our Support Services 
and Partnership Homes divisions; an excellent 
achievement in the current environment.
Operating margins remained strong in our 
Construction division at 2.6% (2009: 2.6%) and 
grew in our Support Services division to 4.5%  
(2009: 4.1%). The Partnership Homes division also 
saw an increase in operating margin to 6.3% (2009: 
0.7%) benefiting, in particular, from land disposals 
and transfers during the year.
The cash performance, one of our key measures, 
was exceptionally strong, particularly within our 
Construction businesses, with £111.4m generated 
from operating activities during the year. Net 
funds at 30 June 2010 were a record £175.2m  
(2009: £92.5m).
Having maintained the total dividend at 55p 
for two years the Board has demonstrated its 
progressive dividend policy by proposing to increase 
the total dividend for the year by 5.5% to 58.0p 
(2009: 55.0p) which is more than twice covered by 
adjusted earnings per share. The final dividend of 
39.5p will be paid on 26 November to shareholders 
on the register on 24 September and there will be 
a scrip dividend alternative.
Board changes
in March 2010 we said farewell to our chief execu-
tive John Dodds who had been with the Group for 
nearly 40 years, seven of them as chief executive. 
John has been succeeded as chief executive by 
Paul Sheffield, who was managing director of the 
Construction division and who has been with Kier 
for over 25 years. The role of managing director of 
the Construction division has now been assumed 
by Steve Bowcott who we welcomed to the Board 
in July 2010.
Deena Mattar, our Group finance director, 
announced in July 2010 that she would be leaving 
the Group at the Company’s annual general meeting 
on 12 November 2010 after nine years in her current 
role and 12 years at Kier. Haydn Mursell joined the 
Group on 18 August 2010 as Group finance director 
designate and is expected to take over the role of 
Group finance director upon Deena’s departure. 
Haydn joins the Group from Balfour Beatty plc where 
he was deputy finance director.
in September 2010 we announced that Simon 
l eathes, non-executive director and chairman of 
the Audit Committee, would also be stepping down 
from the Board at the Company’s annual general 
meeting after nearly ten-years. He will be succeeded 
by Richard Bailey who will join the Board on  
1 October 2010.
On behalf of the Board i would like to thank John, 
Deena and Simon for their contributions to Kier and 
i welcome Paul, Steve, Haydn and Richard to their 
new roles.
Prospects
We enter the new financial year with healthy 
order books in our Construction and Support 
Services divisions at a combined level of £4.2bn  
(2009: £4.5bn) together with a strong pipeline of 
further opportunities for both of these businesses. 
Our Partnership Homes division is responding well 
to opportunities in the social housing market and 
our land bank is a valuable asset, becoming more 
so as planning restrictions tighten further. We intend 
to develop or sell plots over time in order to realise 
our cash investment. Our Developments business 
is seeing improvement in the appetite for property 
development sites and continues to provide property 
solutions to clients supported by all the divisions 
within the Group.
Our integrated business model continues to 
provide us with competitive advantages by providing 
a total solutions offering to both private and public 
sector clients.
Market conditions in 2011 will remain challenging 
for all our businesses. However, with our strong 
track record of delivery and our innovative financing 
and planning skills, we expect to continue to grow 
our uK market share, particularly in Construction 
and Support Services. i therefore anticipate that 
the Group will make further progress in the new 
financial year.

 The Board of Raven Russia announces the Group’s results for
the year ended 31 December 2011.
The year has shown continued progress in lettings and
financing, both helped by strong demand from occupiers.
Reported net operating income (“NOI”) for the year increased
by 50% from $61.0 million to $91.7 million. Operating profit
increased by 128% from $25.3 million to $57.8 million and
underlying earnings before tax showed a profit of $8.1 million
(2010: loss of $19.8 million). Operating cash inflow increased
147% from $33.1 million to $81.6 million.
After a revaluation surplus of $153 million (2010: $79.2 million),
profit before tax has increased by 131% to $128.9 million
(2010: $55.7 million) and fully diluted net asset value per share
has increased by 13.3% to 119 cents (2010: 105 cents) per
share.
At today’s date the annualised total of NOI including pre let
agreements (“PLAs”) and letters of intent (“LOIs”) is $129 million.
On that basis, 92% of our 1.03 million square metres (“sqm”) of
completed portfolio is let.
Our balance sheet remains strong. Gearing remains low at
38.1% (2010: 35.6%) as calculated in note 34 to the financial
statements. Our year end cash balance stood at $181.8 million
(2010: $107.6 million).
As a result of the considerable progress made we are able to
declare a final distribution of 1.75 pence per share making a
total of 3 pence for the year. As the shares continue to trade
at a significant discount to NAV we will be distributing in the
form of a tender offer buy back of 1 in 39 ordinary shares at
68 pence. The tender offer will be subject to the approval of
shareholders and a circular setting out full details will be
posted shortly. It is expected that the tender offer will be
completed in May 2012.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders,
employees and advisors for their support during the year.

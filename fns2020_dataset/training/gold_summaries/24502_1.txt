 H&T Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2013

The Group’s trading, market and regulatory environment has become more 
challenging throughout 2013.
Chief Executive’s Review 
In recent years the growth in high street 
alternative credit has been fuelled by a 
combination of rising gold prices and an 
expansion in pay day loans; business models 
have evolved to maximise one or other revenue 
stream. The falling gold price coupled with 
regulatory pressure on pay day loans has 
resulted in lower earnings across the market, 
whilst the increase in store numbers puts 
pressure both on customer acquisition and 
balance sheets.
Our Group is of course no exception. The 
Group has always maintained that gold 
purchasing is not a core earnings stream and 
adequate headroom has been maintained 
between our average lending rates and the 
scrap value of gold. The Group continues to 
monitor its lending policy on a regular basis, 
with consideration of the impact on affordability 
(and therefore redemption rate), and its loan 
to value in relation to the current gold price. 
As a result of the Group’ s historic policy of 
maintaining an appropriate loan to value ratio 
we have not had to make significant changes 
to lending rates as, in the short term, that can 
damage consumer confidence.
Profit before tax in the period fell to £6.7m 
(2012: £17.0m) principally as a result of the 
lower gold price impacting on pawnbroking 
scrap revenues and gold purchasing gross 
profit. As a consequence, our priority in H2 13 
has been to improve retail sales as the way to 
maximise disposition margins, reduce net debt 
and reduce costs. I am pleased to report good 
progress with all of these initiatives.
During Q4 2013 our like-for-like retail sales 
were up 56% on prior year with gross profit up 
18% and this momentum has been sustained 
into early 2014. Costs have been reduced as 
planned and our net debt, as at 31 December 
2013, has reduced to £20.7m from £27.6m 
at 31 December 2012; net debt has reduced 
still further since year end to £18.5m as at 31 
January 2014. Our total operating costs were 
£44.2m in 2012, reducing to £42.3m in 2013 
despite increasing the store count to 194 at 31 
December 2013.
Since 2008 the Group has opened 92 new 
stores and closed only two. The Group expects 
that as a result of the lower returns now being 
delivered from stores there will be a small 
number of closures in 2014.
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
Pawn Service Charge
The Group’ s Pawn Service Charge grew to 
£28.8m (2012: £28.4m) and now represents 
54.3% of Group gross profit (2012: 45.6%).
While it is pleasing to note growth in our Pawn 
Service Charge in every year since flotation, 
the Group’ s key performance indicators are 
not performing as we would wish. Increased 
competitive pressure at the Group’ s older stores 
and reduced security by way of the lower gold 
price have contributed to lending remaining flat 
year on year despite the increased contribution 
from recent store openings. On a like-for-like 
basis, lending fell by 6.3% year on year.
The possibility of a further reduction in quantities 
of gold in circulation remains a concern for the 
Group and supports our drive to widen the 
asset base upon which we lend. Of the £104m 
lent in 2013, the Group lent £7.2m on watches 
and £14.8m on gem set items. Increasingly, a 
younger generation of customers are seeking 
the opportunity to raise cash from electronic 
items such as phones, tablets, laptops and 
game consoles. T aking advantage of this 
‘asset’ class the Group now offers a Buy Back 
service, whereby customers can sell their 
electronic items to H&T for cash and enter into 
an agreement to buy the item back within 31 
days. This service is now offered in all of H&T’ s 
stores. In order to manage risk goods taken 
are restricted to current models with clear 
routes of disposition. During the year the Group 
purchased £0.7m of high-end electronics using 
Buy Back. H&T Group plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2013

STRATEGIC REPORT
In addition to the Buy Back service, other key 
initiatives to drive customer numbers in 2013, 
included:
•	 Focus 	 on 	 incr easing 	 lending 	 on 	 watches 	 and	
gemset jewellery, up 5.7% on 2012;
•	 The 	 launch 	 of 	 Sona 	 Loans
TM
, the 
pawnbroking service specifically for the 
Asian community, the first of its kind in the 
UK;
•	 The 	 launch 	 of 	 for eign 	 exchange 	 in 	 all 	 stor es,	
the service brought 31,730 new customers 
to H&T in 2013;
•	 Pr oduction 	 of 	 lapsed 	 customer 	 mailers,	
including a retail discount offering as a 
means of replenishing customer’s assets;
•	 Engagement 	 with 	 the 	 local 	 community	
through the Keep it Local campaign 
where stores are coordinating activity to 
reinvigorate the local high street and engage 
with local business groups and charities.
The reduced gold price has placed pressure 
on loan to value ratios in the year as we seek 
to maintain adequate security in the loan 
whilst also being competitive to attract new 
customers. We have historically managed loan 
to value well such that even with the reduced 
gold price our historic loans still have adequate 
security. We believe this provides a competitive 
advantage in the short term as other providers 
must alter lending rates significantly to control 
their exposure.
Retail
Competitive pressure on lending rates and 
the reduced gold price have combined to 
significantly reduce the viability of melting stock 
as a source of profitable disposition of excess 
stock. Retail has accordingly seen significant 
additional focus in H2 13, acting both as a 
hedge against a falling gold price and as a 
means of supporting our loan valuations.
I am pleased to report that sales have 
increased by 24% year on year to £24.9m 
(2012: £20.1m) with most growth occurring 
in H2 2013. Continued capital investment into 
bright and welcoming stores, together with 
the increased working capital invested in stock 
levels provide the Group with a solid base 
from which to further grow retail sales. Other 
initiatives include a rebranding across a small 
number of trial stores, improved point of sale 
materials in store and allowing store managers 
greater operational flexibility in store. All of the 
above has led to a dramatic upturn in retail 
sales as evidenced by our quarterly like-for-like 
sales performance versus prior year: Q1 13: 
-20%; Q2 13: -4%, Q3 13: 7%; Q4 13: 56%.
The retail margin fell from 49.0% in 2012 to 
39.8% in 2013. This decrease is due to an 
increased cost of goods resulting from higher 
lending rates in 2012 and repricing to reflect 
the lower gold price. Our focus is to use retail 
to drive additional gross profit and support our 
lending proposition by providing a profitable 
disposition route for unredeemed goods. 
We would not necessarily expect a return to 
historic margins without adversely impacting 
volume of sales.
Pawnbroking Scrap
Pawnbroking scrap profits totalled £1.8m 
(2012: £7.4m). Splitting this into half yearly 
performances reveals the impact of the gold 
price fall. In H1 13, profits were £1.9m with a 
margin of 23%, while in H2 13 losses totalled 
£0.1m on sales of £6.7m.
At the current gold price and current average 
lent rate on items forfeited (which is circa 12% 
higher than the Group’s average overall lending 
rate), the Group is not expecting to make a 
margin on pawnbroking scrap for at least 
the next six months until lending rates are re-
adjusted. The Group is currently focussing on 
maximising its pawn service charge subject to 
managing lending rates to ensure affordability 
and therefore high rates of redemption. Retail 
sales, as discussed, will be the key disposition 
route.
Gold Purchasing
Gold Purchasing profits declined from £12.0m 
in 2012 to £4.8m in 2013. This decrease is 
attributable to four key factors:
i. A lower gold price year on year. At 31 
December 2013 the sterling gold price was 
£727 per troy ounce (31 Dec 12: £1,020). 
This 29% fall directly impacts on the gross 
profits of each transaction. The declining 
gold price, due to the lag between purchase 
and sale, has also led to a lower margin than 
would have been achieved in a stable price 
environment.

retail and scrap) 81.2%

ii. Closure of Gold Bar operations. The Group’s 
retail mall units contributed £0.7m to gold 
purchasing profits in 2013 as compared 
to £3.1m in 2012 as the Group has 
gradually exited this operation. Closing units 
throughout the year due to the flexible and 
short-term basis upon which the operation 
was founded, the Group now has no retail 
mall units in operation.
iii. Volume decline. Underlying gold purchasing 
volumes, or in other words, the weight of 
gold purchased, have been in decline for the 
last 2 ½ years. Over the last twelve months, 
it is estimated that the decline across the 
Group’s store estate was 26%. The Group 
has always viewed gold purchasing as a 
short term opportunity rather than a core 
earnings stream.
iv. Improved retail sales. A greater percentage 
of gold purchased has been disposed of via 
the Group’s retail operations as opposed to 
being melted and therefore recorded within 
gold purchasing revenues. During Q4 2013 
the cost of goods sold through the retail 
channel was up by 118% on prior year.
We believe, that as well as remaining 
competitive on pricing, the Group’s longevity in 
this market is helping to build brand recognition 
and trust among our customers.
Cheque Cashing
Cheque Cashing income fell to £3.3m (2012: 
£3.7m) due to the withdrawal from Pay Day 
Loans and reduced numbers of third party 
cheques in circulation.
The largest part of the decline was in Pay Day 
Loans which is no longer offered in our stores 
in favour of the more flexible personal loans 
offering that replaced KwikLoan. The Group 
expects that Pay Day Loans will continue to 
face regulatory scrutiny and pressure and 
notes that the FCA has committed to capping 
the number of rollovers to two and, after 
government intervention, a cap on their interest 
rates. These controls will impact significantly 
on providers of these services and we believe 
that this can create further opportunities for the 
business as we establish our personal loans 
offering.
Personal Loans
The Group has replaced the KwikLoan 
product in stores with a new more flexible 
personal loans offering. The new product 
enables a customer to choose a loan amount 
of up to £1,000, subject to affordability, and 
a repayment term of up to two years. The 
new product is supported by new in-store 
applications systems, central underwriting and 
an enhanced administration and collections 
system. We plan to launch this offering online 
during 2014.
The loan book, net of provisions, increased to 
£2.0m at the year-end (2012: £1.2m).
REGULATION
The regulation of consumer credit is moving 
from the Office of Fair Trading (“OFT”) to the 
Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) in April 
2014. The FCA has issued consultation 
documents on the new regime and plans to 
publish a final Consumer Credit sourcebook 
in March 2014. The FCA expects that all 
credit businesses will comply with the core 
FCA requirements in terms of the principles 
and management standards from April 2014 
but there will be a period of six months to 
comply fully with the new Consumer Credit 
sourcebook. 
There are a number of specific provisions 
within the new regime relating to High Cost 
Short Term Credit, designed to impact Pay Day 
Loans and we expect further requirements to 
emerge in due course. The Group has now 
withdrawn fully from Pay Day Loans. At present 
the current regulations and legislation relating 
to pawnbroking have been transferred to the 
new regime without significant changes. We 
do not expect the interest rate cap to impact 
pawnbroking at this point.
The Group has employed a Compliance 
Manager to supplement and enhance the 
existing compliance functions within the 
business and ensure that we manage through 
this significant change successfully.
BUSINESS STRATEGY AND OUTLOOK
The Group seeks to retain its position as the 
UK’s leading pawnbroker by providing easy 
access to cash and other related services 
in a fair, safe and friendly environment that 
exceeds the expectations of our customers. 
The Group aims to maintain its high levels 
of repeat custom with a continued focus on 
brand recognition, excellent customer service,

investment in the existing store estate and 
maintaining its reputation for fairness and 
honesty. 
The Group believes that the demand for small 
sum, short term cash loans remains strong and 
by increasing the range of assets it accepts, by 
developing an attractive unsecured loan offer 
and through better marketing it can continue 
to succeed as the market adjusts in 2014. The 
successful introduction of new services such 
as Western Union and FX drives footfall to our 
stores enabling the Group to communicate its 
range of services to a wider customer base 
whilst also providing incremental revenue.
Current trading is in line with management’s 
expectations for 2014 and in particular the 
growth in retail seen in Q4 2013 has continued 
into early 2014. 
I would also like to add my great thanks to 
those of the Chairman, in recognising all 
our people whose skills, commitment and 
enthusiasm continue to drive our success,  
and who give us confidence in the future.

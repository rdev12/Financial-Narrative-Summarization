BBL or bbl: Barrel of oil.
Bcf or bcf: Billion cubic feet of gas.
BOE or boe: Barrels of oil equivalent.
BOpd or bopd: Barrels of oil produced per day.
C 
ciip: condensate initially in place.
condensate: a light oil, often discovered with significant volumes of natural gas, which is 
gaseous under certain reservoir conditions.
cOs: chance of success
cpr: competent p erson’s report
D 
discovery: a discovery of hydrocarbons not previously evidenced by drilling, recoverable at  
the surface in a flow measurable by conventional petroleum  
industry testing methods.
E 
Etinde permit: the permit granted by the government of cameroon which covers  
the area of 2,314 square km and consists of block mLhp-5, block mLhp-6 and  
block mLhp-7, all within the rio del rey Basin and the douala Basin.
G
giip: gas initially in place.

mmBOE or mmboe: million barrels of oil equivalent.
mmcf or mmcf: million cubic feet of gas.
mW: a unit of electrical power equal to one million watts or one thousand kilowatts.
P 
p50 or 2p: means 50% probability that volumes will be equal to or greater than stated volumes.
prospect, lead and play: a play is an exploration concept or idea that is conducive to the 
identification of leads, which in turn may become prospects when they are ready to be drilled.
psc: production-sharing contract.
R 
risked recoverable reserves: unrisked reserves, which have been reduced in volume as a 
consequence of applying cOs factors to their recoverability.
S 
2d seismic data: data resulting from two-dimensional seismic acquisition.
3d seismic data: data resulting from three-dimensional seismic acquisition.
U
unrisked recoverable reserves: Estimated reserves of hydrocarbons before

Our Performance
“Recognising the growth 
opportunity in “Cloud” services  
we have continued to invest 
significantly in these areas.” 
Introduction
The Group has had a solid year financially with revenues increasing 
by 10.5% to £271.6m (2010: £245.8m) and underlying profit before 
tax
(2)
 increasing by 8.7% to £32.0m (2010: £29.5m). There were no 
acquisitions during the year and all three businesses delivered organic 
growth in both revenue and underlying profit from operations
(1)
.
We have seen some confidence returning to the IT services market 
in the UK with businesses now proceeding with IT projects which had 
been deferred and many organisations, in both the public and private 
sectors, continuing to see outsourcing as a key method of reducing 
their own cost bases. Although current economic conditions and the 
recent spending review by the Government have created a degree of 
uncertainty, the overall trend for outsourcing remains promising and 
our Phoenix IT Services (Partner Services) Division remains well placed 
to support outsourcing companies in delivering essential services at a 
lower cost.
The emergence of “Cloud” computing marks a major shift in the IT 
services market driven by developments in virtualisation, web-based 
architecture and improvements in network capacity. Recognising the 
growth opportunity in “Cloud” services we have continued to invest 
significantly in these areas, particularly our managed hosting annuity 
contracts business and as a result the Group is able to offer customised 
services which have significant business advantages in terms of 
flexibility, risk reduction and compliance to its customer base. 
Growth in these “Cloud” services combined with reducing costs 
elsewhere in the Group has helped to mitigate revenue declines in 
areas where there is price competition or where we are reducing 
emphasis. However, this planned transition has had the effect of 
constraining short-term profitability, particularly within the Servo 
(Mid-market Services) Division but we continue to be encouraged 
by improvements in the pipeline, and we are currently bidding for a 
number of opportunities with both new and existing customers.

Simplified organisational structure
The ICM Continuous Business (Business Continuity) and Servo (Mid-
market Services) Divisions merged to create a single end-user based 
organisation operating as one business within the Phoenix IT Group 
from 4 April 2011. The combined business, which will be reported from 
1 April 2011 in our Financial Statements as one division, will be known 
as ICM.
The combined business operates from 23 UK locations and offers a full 
breadth of IT and business continuity solutions, from Managed Hosting 
and “Cloud” Services to Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery, 
as well as a full range of Infrastructure Management and Professional 
Services. 
In recent years, there has been a move away from traditional IT disaster 
recovery solutions towards the more holistic all-round concept of 
business resilience, which encompasses a company’s strategy for 
identifying, mitigating and responding to potential business risks. The 
merger of the two divisions allows the Group to offer an end-to-end 
business proposition centred around resilience.
The Servo (Mid-market Services) Division brings expertise in the 
design, implementation and hosting of resilient solutions, while ICM 
Continuous Business (Business Continuity) provides business continuity 
services designed around the workings of these solutions. Whilst other 
organisations offer similar services to our individual component parts, our 
combined offering provides customers with a complete service, which on 
a standalone basis we believe will be unrivalled in the UK market.

Revenue £55.5m £53.1m +4.4%
Underlying profit  
from operations £14.4m £13.3m +8.5%

margin 26.0% 25.0% 
Order book £113.7m £104.3m +9.1%
Annual contract value £55.4m £54.5m +1.8%
Revenues for the year were £55.5m (2010: £53.1m), an increase of 
4.4% including £2.1m (2010: £0.3m) in respect of Shadow Planner, 
our business continuity planning tool business which was acquired 
on 23 December 2009. Excluding the impact of Shadow Planner, 
Divisional revenues increased by 1.1% with revenue growth held 
back by lower, traditional IT disaster recovery revenues. The growth 
in “Cloud” services and in particular virtualisation continues to create 
new solutions for IT business continuity as an alternative to traditional 
disaster recovery options. 
This modest revenue growth is reflected in the order book and annual 
contract values at 31 March 2011. Order book increased by 9.1% to 
£113.7m (2010: £104.3m) bolstered by a £17.2m five year extension in 
June 2010 to the Division’s largest business continuity contract. This 
contract, due to expire in March 2011 was extended until March 2016. 
The annual contract value increased to £55.4m as at 31 March 2011  
(2010: £54.5m) providing good visibility of future revenues which will 
be recognised during the current financial year.
Business Review
Chief Executive’s Review Nick Robinson 04
20325.04 15/06/2011 Proof 5
Chief Executive’s Review continued
Underlying profit from operations was £14.4m (2010: £13.3m) with 
Shadow Planner contributing £0.5m (2010: £nil). During the second 
half of the year, underlying profitability improved as a result of tight 
controls on the cost base and this translated into a year on year 
improvement in operating margin from 25.0% to 26.0%. 
During the year, the Division has continued to invest for growth 
through expenditure on developing new products and services within 
the “Cloud” as well as expanding its infrastructure and business 
continuity capacity. Up-grades have taken place at the Birmingham, 
Hamilton and Farnborough data-centres, as well as a power upgrade 
at our Wapping facility. This capacity expansion programme will 
continue into 2012 and 2013 to meet the increased demand for work-
area capacity, particularly in the London financial markets.
The merger of the ICM Continuous Business (Business Continuity) with 
our Servo (Mid-market Services) Division from 4 April 2011 will provide 
further opportunities to sell business continuity services and hosting to 
a significantly wider customer base. 
“. . . our combined offering 
provides customers with a 
complete service, which on a 
standalone basis we believe will  
be unrivalled in the UK market.”

 2011 2010 Change
Revenue £98.2m £88.5m +11.0%
Underlying profit  
from operations £8.3m £8.0m +2.6%
Underlying operating  
margin 8.4% 9.1%
Order book £73.6m £54.3m +35.5%
Annual contract value £49.1m £47.9m +2.6%
Despite a slow start to the year, Divisional revenues grew by 11.0% 
mainly due to the acquisition of support contracts from KCOM Group 
plc during the last quarter of the previous Financial Year, combined 
with an increase in managed hosting activity and stronger project and 
professional services revenues. There has been further progress in 
improving the quality of business mix in the Division as the proportion 
of non-annuity contract revenue continues to fall and managed 
hosting revenues increase.
Underlying profit from operations increased to £8.3m (2010: £8.0m). 
During the year, the Division continued to strengthen its sales and 
marketing effort and this investment has had the effect of constraining 
profitability in the short-term and diluting the underlying operating 
margin percentage from 9.1% to 8.4% for the year as a whole.
Despite the loss of £3.5m of annual contract value, announced in our 
Q1 IMS in August 2010, which resulted from the decision by a customer 
to in-source some of the activities provided by the Group, there has 
been significant growth in the order book driven by new business wins 
during the year. The Divisional order book grew by 35.5% to £73.6m 
at 31 March 2011 (2010: £54.3m) and the annualised contract value 
increased by 2.6% to £49.1m at 31 March 2011 (2010: £47.9m).
The business has continued to extend its presence in the mid-market 
sector and grow its managed hosting annuity business. The hosting 
annual contract base increased by 35.3% to £13.0m at 31 March 2011 
(2010: £9.6m) clearly demonstrating the strength of its service offering 
as customers switch to hosting technology within our business. The 
increase in managed hosting business, aided by investment in the sales 
force in the first half of the year, has been the driving force behind a 
significant increase in underlying operating margin from 7.1% in the 
first half to 9.6% during the second half of the year.
Whilst the focus remains on growing managed hosting annuity 
revenues it has also been encouraging to see stronger year on year 
project and professional services revenues. This is a reflection of 
confidence returning to the market, as businesses are now willing 
to proceed with projects which had previously been delayed or 
postponed. 
The growth in managed hosting, supported by a carefully directed 
capacity expansion programme, should ensure that higher and more 
sustainable underlying operating margins are achievable in this 
business.

Our Performance

 Year ended  Year ended
 31 March 31 March
 2011 2010 Change
Revenue £117.9m £104.2m +13.1%
Underlying profit  
from operations £16.7m £16.4m +2.2%
Underlying operating  
margin 14.2% 15.7%
Order book £140.7m £194.4m -27.6%
Annual contract value £95.3m £101.3m -5.9%
Divisional revenues increased by 13.1% to £117.9m (2010: £104.2m), 
partly due to a recovery in project and professional services revenues 
from the low levels reported last Financial Year, combined with the 
year on year benefit of three outsourcing contracts secured during 
the latter part of the previous Financial Year. The integration of these 
contracts into the existing business is now complete and profitability 
is in line with our expectations. With the introduction of efficiency 
savings we expect to see improved profitability on these contracts, 
moving into low double-digit margins in the coming Financial Year. 
Underlying profit from operations increased to £16.7m (2010: 
£16.4m) despite the continued competitive pricing environment. As 
anticipated, underlying operating margins were diluted by the lower 
margins achieved on the three outsourcing contracts referred to 
above. The underlying operating margin excluding the effect of these 
outsourcing contracts increased from 16.1% to 16.7%, reflecting in 
part tight control over the cost base during the year.
Whilst we have seen some improvement in market conditions during 
2011, there was a scarcity of large contract opportunities to be won. 
The Divisional order book, which was boosted at the beginning of the 
year by a number of large contract wins in the previous year, reduced 
by £53.7m to £140.7m (2010: £194.4m). This reduction has in part been 
driven by a structural move in our market to shorter contracts. While 
this provides the customer with more flexibility, we typically see these 
shorter contracts renew. The annual contract value at 31 March 2011 
was £95.3m (2010: £101.3m). 
Despite a decline in order book and annual contract value there have 
been some encouraging developments within the business this year. 
The work performed in integrating the three large contracts has laid 
the platform for further success and brought in considerable retail 
sector expertise. In addition, towards the end of the Financial Year, 
the Division acquired a five year lease on a co-location facility allowing 
the Division to increase the breadth of services within its portfolio. 
Initial take-up has been promising and the expansion of the service 
offering into the provision of hosting services to partners will enable 
the Division to take advantage of the increasing shift towards “Cloud” 
technology. The Division’s wide range of service options, multiple 
technologies and optimised infrastructure availability leave it well 
positioned to enable its partners’ push into the “Cloud”. 
Whilst we have seen some encouraging activity during the year and 
have a strong pipeline of future prospects, we anticipate that future 
new business wins are likely to be offset by pressure on margins. 
Outlook
Following the investments made during the year in increasing hosting 
capacity and capability, we are well positioned to take advantage 
of the market shift towards “Cloud” computing in both operating 
divisions. The breadth of services that we can offer via the merged end 
user division leads us to anticipate further growth in managed hosting 
and “Cloud” services into the current Financial Year. Whilst growth 
predictions are more cautious in respect of the Partner Services 
division, the Group as a whole retains good visibility of forward 
revenues giving a strong platform on which to build for the future.

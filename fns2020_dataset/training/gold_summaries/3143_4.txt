 CeNeS has a balanced portfolio of late 
stage compounds and pre-clinical projects 
comprising morphine-6-glucuronide 
(“M6G”) in Phase III clinical trials for 
the treatment of post-operative pain; 
CNS 5161 in Phase II clinical trials for 
the treatment of neuropathic pain; and 
CNS 7056 in pre-clinical development 
as a short acting sedative for day case 
procedures. CeNeS also has a 
discovery programme to identify novel 
COMT inhibitors for the treatment of 
Parkinson’s disease and schizophrenia 
(see ﬁgure 1).
CeNeS is based in Cambridge, 
UK from where we direct our 
discovery and development 
activities utilising an outsourcing 
business model. By minimising 
central overheads and utilising 
specialist contract suppliers, we can 
manage our cash resources prudently 
and focus expenditure upon our key 
programmes that are planned to 
generate valuable collaborations 
and partnerships.
CeNeS strategy is to build a proﬁtable, 
European specialty pharmaceutical 
company by developing, partnering and 
marketing its portfolio of products, which 
offer signiﬁcant improvements over the 
existing ‘gold standard’ treatments.
CeNeS commenced operations in 
1997 and is listed on the Alternative 
Investment Market (“AIM”) of the London 
Stock Exchange.

PORTFOLIO REVIEW PROCESS
CeNeS conducts a comprehensive and rigorous portfolio 
review process each year, led by the Chair of the Scientiﬁc 
Advisory Board (“SAB”), Ann Hayes PhD. Each programme 
is reviewed in detail and the following data are input into the 
CeNeS model:
 phase/timelines of programme;
 costs;
  peak sales, net present value and risk adjusted 
net present value; and
 probability of success and detailed risk scoring.
Detailed risk scoring takes account of the following factors:
 phase of development;
 strength of scientiﬁc rationale;
 tractability of chemistry;
 ease of pre-clinical development;
 ease of clinical development;
 competition; and
 IP position.
The resulting data enables CeNeS to assess the rationale, 
both scientiﬁc and commercial, for the continued development 
of each programme, identiﬁes the key risks and also provides 
an overview of the product portfolio (see ﬁgure 2).

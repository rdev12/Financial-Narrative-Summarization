_1_PHY_ar10_cover_[LP.SH].indd   1 26/01/2011   08:52:27 Phytopharm (LSE:PYM) is a development 
stage pharmaceutical company 
developing novel treatments targeting 
diseases with high unmet need. Our 
lead series of compounds has the 
potential to be a new class of therapy 
for neurodegenerative diseases.
Phytopharm has evolved its approach of developing 
products extracted from natural botanical sources to 
investigating single chemical entities. We will deliver 
key development milestones in the next two years. 
Phytopharm works as a virtual company and utilises a 
network of scientific and clinical experts to help guide 
our development projects.
Our objective is to develop products aimed at major markets 
to key value inflection points before seeking late‑stage development 
and commercial partners.

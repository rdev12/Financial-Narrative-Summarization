“The 2008 outturn has been better than expected. It is far too early to be sure where 2009 will end up but
despite a general downturn we are far from discouraged. We are ahead of our plans and expect to see over
£50 million of further cash generation in 2009 out of the FKI acquisition. Combined with the improvement
plans we have, the translation effect of currency and at least £25 million of cost reduction programmes
already in place this will cushion us from an almost inevitable reduction in the topline.
We have a mix of geographically diverse businesses with good market positions and with loyal customers
in sectors such as power generation, oil and gas, and healthcare. Where we are exposed to more vulnerable
sectors such as automotive and construction we have excellent management teams who are taking decisive
action on cost reduction programmes, product innovation and geographic diversification.”

Overview
Accoya
	
is	the	world’s	leading	high	technology	long	life	
wood	(www.accoya.com).	Created	via	acetylated	wood	
modification,	a	highly	sustainable	process	which	also	
uses	sustainably	grown	timber,	the	Accoya
	
process	
creates	a	modified	wood	that	matches	or	exceeds	the	
durability,	stability	and	beauty	of	the	very	best	tropical	
hardwoods	and	other	man-made	materials.
Applications
Accoya
	
wood	is	ideal	for	windows,	external	doors,	
cladding/siding,	decking,	structural	and	civil	engineering	
projects	due	to	world	class	dimensional	stability	and	
class	1	durability.
Overview 
Tricoya
	
Wood	Elements	(www.tricoya.com)	are	
produced	using	Accsys’s	proprietary	technology	for	
the	acetylation	of	wood	chips,	and	particles	for	use	
in	the	fabrication	of	panel	products	such	as	medium	
density	fibreboard	and	particle-board.	These	products	
demonstrate	enhanced	durability	and	dimensional	
stability	which	allow	them	to	be	used	in	a	variety	of	
applications	that	were	once	limited	to	tropical	hardwood	
or	man-made	products.
Applications
The	potential	applications	for	Tricoya
	
are	far	ranging	
and	will	inspire	creativity	and	discovery,	particularly	in	
environments	where	humidity	and	weather	are	usually	
concerns.	Typical	applications	include:	Façade	cladding/
siding	and	other	secondary	exterior	applications,	
window	components,	door	components	and	door		
skins	and	wet	interiors,	including	wall	linings.

CASE STUDY

and Medite Tricoya
® 
 
Extreme Feature in award winning  
‘Smart’ Garden at RHS Chelsea  
Flower Show 2016 – UK
Designed	by	acclaimed	landscape	architect	Hay	Joung	
Hwang	the	LG	Smart	Garden	was	awarded	a	RHS	Silver	Gilt	
Medal	alongside	eight	other	show	gardens.
Accoya
	
wood	was	used	to	create	a	water	feature,	interior 	
cladding	and	external	furniture	and	Medite	Tricoya
	
Extreme
®
	
featured	in	the	roof,	fascias	and	5.5	metre	pergolas	which 		
add	height	and	texture	to	the	garden.	
The	minimalist	lifestyle	garden	acted	as	a	metaphor	for	
modern	life,	contrasting	natural	and	artificial	elements	while	
blending	a	‘cool’	Scandinavian	style	with	oriental	tranquillity.
Accoya
	
is	excellent	for	use	outdoors	which	is	why	Hay	
recommends	it	to	many	private	clients,	and	has	used	it	at	
both	RHS	Chelsea	Flower	Show	and	the	Chaumont-sur-Loire	
International	Garden	Show.
The	garden	was	crafted	by	master	carpenter	Alan	Hayward	
and	constructed	by	leading	landscape	firm	Randle	Siddeley. 05

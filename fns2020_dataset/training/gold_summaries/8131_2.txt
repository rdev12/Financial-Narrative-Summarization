DRIVING GROWTH
Through our cooperation with The Innovation
Group we have significantly improved our
customer relationships to the point where
98% are “highly satisfied“ and would 
recommend us to others.This partnership
has not only led to increased customer 
retention but has also significantly reduced
our claim costs by 15-25% depending on 
the claim type.

A year of robust progress
 Polymetal demonstrated strong operational 
performance throughout the year. Total gold 
equivalent production of 1,063 Koz was up 31% 
compared to 2011, exceeding the original projection 
of 1 Moz. This reﬂects stable operations at all  
of our mature mines, with a notable improvement  
at Dukat and growth at Omolon and Albazino. 
 Metal sales for the full year exceeded production  
for both gold and silver.
 The Amursk POX, the ﬁrst operating POX plant  
in Russia’s gold industry, has been slower than 
planned to come online, but the ramp-up is 
progressing and we expect it to reach full  
capacity by the end of 2013. 
 There has been a dramatic increase of the resource 
base at Albazino and potential new growth assets 
have been identiﬁed through successful exploration 
at Kutyn and Svetloye.
 We have implemented a new dividend policy,  
raising the payout ratio to 30% and introducing 
special dividends. The ﬁrst special dividend in the 
Company’s history of US$0.50 per share was  
paid in January 2013; a ﬁnal dividend for 2012  
of US$0.31 per share is proposed.

  The Company deﬁnes adjusted EBITDA (a non-IFRS 
measure) as proﬁt for the period adjusted for 
depreciation expense, rehabilitation expenses, 
writedown of inventory to net realisable value, 
share-based compensation, listing expenses, 
additional mining tax, penalties and accrued  
interest, income on disposal of subsidiaries, bargain 
purchase gain, foreign exchange gain/(loss), change 
in fair value of derivatives, change in fair value of 
contingent consideration, ﬁnance income, ﬁnance 
costs, and income tax expense. Adjusted EBITDA 
margin is adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.

  Total cash costs comprise cost of sales of the 
operating assets (adjusted for depreciation expense, 
rehabilitation expenses and write-down of inventory 
to net realisable value) and general, administrative 
and selling expenses of the operating assets.  
Gold equivalent sales volume is calculated based on 
average realised metal prices in the relevant period. 
Total cash cost per gold equivalent ounce sold is 
calculated as total cash costs divided by total gold 
equivalent unit ounces sold.

  Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves are estimated  
in accordance with the JORC Code (2004).  
Mineral Resources are additional to Ore Reserves.
How we’ve delivered
Our original objective for 2012 was to deliver  
1.0 Moz of gold equivalent, and we are  
naturally pleased to have exceeded this  
target. Since our operating activities remain  
on track, we are conﬁdent that we will achieve 
production of 1.2 Moz in 2013 and 1.4 Moz of 
gold equivalent in 2014.
How we’ve performed
We have demonstrated strong ﬁnancial performance for the year,  
driven by excellent operational performance and tight cost and capital 
discipline. We remain committed to delivering value to shareholders  
by proposing a ﬁnal dividend which, combined with special dividends, 
will result in sector-leading yield combined with solid growth proﬁle.

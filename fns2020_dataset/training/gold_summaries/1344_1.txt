The	 Group	 achieved	 a	 record	 performance	 in	 the	 year	 to	 April	 2006.	 Revenue	 increased	 by	 21.8%	 to	 £638.0m.	 Underlying	 profit	 for	 the	 year	 before	 tax	 of	 £67.5m	 was	 three	 times	 last	 year’s	 £22.4m,	 while	 the	 pre-tax	 profit	 for	 the	 year	 was	 £81.7m.	 Underlying	 basic	 earnings	 per	 share	 were	 12.2p	 (2005:	 2.6p)	 while	 basic	 earnings	 per	 share	 were	 14.7p	 (2005:	 5.6p).	 On	 a	 cash	 tax	 basis,	 earnings	 per	 share	 were	 17.8p	 (2005:	 6.7p).	 The	 Group	 now	 reports	 its	 results	 under	 International	 Financial	 Reporting	 Standards	 (IFRS)	 and	 comparatives	 have	 been	 restated	 accordingly	 (see	 note	 28	 to	 the	 financial	 statements).

Reflecting	 the	 Group’s	 operational	 gearing,	 the	 21.8%	 revenue	 increase	 resulted	 in	 a	 32.5%	 increase	 in	 EBITDA	 before	 exceptional	 items	 to	 £224.7m	 and	 an	 increase	 of	 65.5%	 in	 operating	 profit	 before	 exceptional	 items	 to	 £111.1m.	 Measured	 at	 constant	 exchange	 rates,	 to	 eliminate	 currency	 translation	 effects,	 revenue	 grew	 17.8%,	 EBITDA	 before	 04	 	 Ashtead Group plc	 Annual	 report	 and	 accounts	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 30	 April	 2006 International	 equipment	 rental exceptional	 items	 grew	 28.0%,	 operating	 profit	 before	 exceptional	 items	 grew	 58.6%	 and	 underlying	 profit	 before	 tax	 was	 still	 almost	 three	 times	 that	 of	 last	 year.	 These	 improvements	 were	 reflected	 in	 the	 Group’s	 margins.	 EBITDA	 margins	 grew	 from	 32.4%	 to	 35.2%	 and	 operating	 margins	 (before	 exceptional	 items)	 rose	 from	 12.8%	 to	 17.4%.
Sunbelt
In	 the	 year	 to	 30	 April	 2006	 revenue	 grew	 23.8%	 to	 $818.7m.	 This	 was	 achieved	 through	 increased	 investment	 in	 the	 rental	 fleet	 which	 was	 	 on	 average	 11%	 larger	 than	 a	 year	 ago	 and	 by	 significant	 increases	 in	 rental	 rates	 which	 were	 increased	 approximately	 12%	 in	 strong	 market	 conditions.	 Average	 utilisation	 remained	 high	 at	 70%	 (2005:	 69%).	 Revenue	 growth	 was	 broadly	 based	 with	 all	 regions	 and	 all	 major	 product	 areas	 trading	 ahead	 of	 last	 year.	 Last	 summer’s	 hurricanes	 are	 estimated	 to	 have	 added	 around	 2%	 to	 2005/6’s	 revenues.	 In	 a	 strong	 trading	 environment	 where	 US	 non-residential	 construction	 rose	 10.2%	 in	 the	 12	 months	 to	 end	 April,	 according	 to	 figures	 published	 by	 the	 	 US	 Department	 of	 Commerce,	 Sunbelt	 continued	 to	 take	 market	 share.	 Revenues	 from	 house	 builders,	 where	 the	 short	 term	 outlook	 is	 less	 certain,	 accounted	 for	 just	 6%	 of	 Sunbelt’s	 revenues.	 The	 shift	 from	 ownership	 to	 rental	 in	 the	 US	 continued	 with	 the	 rental	 market	 again	 growing	 faster	 than	 its	 key	 customer	 base,	 non-residential	 construction,	 in	 calendar	 2005.
For	 the	 full	 year,	 Sunbelt’s	 operating	 profit	 before	 exceptional	 items	 was	 up	 62.7%	 to	 $175.5m,	 representing	 a	 margin	 of	 21.4%	 (2005:	 16.3%).
Sunbelt	 continued	 to	 invest	 to	 reduce	 the	 age	 of	 its	 rental	 fleet	 and	 	 to	 invest	 for	 growth,	 spending	 $257.9m	 in	 the	 year,	 including	 the	 funding	 of	 six	 new	 greenfield	 stores.	 A	 further	 16	 new	 general	 equipment	 rental	 stores	 were	 acquired	 during	 the	 year	 for	 a	 consideration,	 including	 costs,	 of	 approximately	 $100m.	 The	 acquired	 stores	 were	 all	 immediately	 transferred	 onto	 Sunbelt’s	 point	 of	 sale	 system	 and	 staff	 incentive	 programmes	 and	 began	 trading	 as	 Sunbelt	 stores	 from	 their	 acquisition	 closing	 date.	 The	 financial	 performance	 since	 acquisition	 has	 been	 strongly	 positive.	 In	 August	 Sunbelt	 also	 disposed	 of	 12	 specialist	 scaffold	 stores	 on	 the	 west	 coast	 and	 in	 Texas	 for	 $24.3m	 generating	 	 an	 exceptional	 disposal	 profit	 of	 $5.1m	 (£2.9m).	 The	 new	 stores	 continue	 Sunbelt’s	 strategy	 of	 clustering	 stores	 in	 major	 metropolitan	 markets.	 Sunbelt	 also	 continues	 to	 emphasise	 organic	 growth	 with	 an	 increase	 	 in	 same	 store	 revenues	 for	 the	 year	 of	 19.3%.
In	 the	 fourth	 quarter	 Sunbelt	 delivered	 revenue	 growth	 of	 27.1%	 and	 growth	 in	 operating	 profit	 before	 exceptional	 items	 of	 63.2%.
A-Plant
A-Plant’s	 revenue	 for	 the	 year	 was	 £160.7m	 compared	 to	 £156.3m	 last	 year.	 The	 successful	 restructuring	 of	 A-Plant’s	 sales	 force	 undertaken	 in	 the	 first	 half	 contributed	 to	 a	 significantly	 improved	 performance	 in	 the	 second	 half	 of	 the	 year	 and	 a	 particularly	 strong	 fourth	 quarter	 in	 which	 revenues	 increased	 by	 8%	 to	 £41.8m	 and	 operating	 profit	 by	 47.1%	 to	 £3.9m.	 Rental	 rates,	 average	 fleet	 size	 and	 utilisation	 for	 the	 year	 were	 all	 at	 similar	 levels	 to	 those	 of	 last	 year.	 Revenues	 from	 A-Plant’s	 largest	 150	 customers	 continued	 to	 grow	 and	 represented	 39%	 of	 the	 year’s	 total.
Operating	 expenses	 were	 again	 carefully	 controlled,	 increasing	 by	 just	 3.4%	 before	 depreciation.	 As	 a	 result	 A-Plant’s	 operating	 profit	 for	 the	 year	 grew	 22.0%	 to	 £13.9m	 (2005:	 £11.3m),	 representing	 a	 margin	 of	 8.6%	 (2005:	 7.3%).	 The	 investment	 A-Plant	 makes	 in	 developing	 its	 staff,	 which	 is	 at	 the	 heart	 of	 its	 improving	 performance,	 was	 recognised	 in	 May	 when	 Hire	 Association	 Europe	 (‘HAE’)	 announced	 that	 A-Plant	 had	 won,	 amongst	 competition	 from	 rental	 companies	 across	 Europe,	 HAE’s	 ‘Excellence	 	 in	 Training’	 award.

review continued
Over £200m invested in the rental fleet  
with £65m being for growth
Ashtead Technology
Ashtead	 Technology’s	 performance	 continued	 recent	 trends	 with	 revenue	 for	 the	 year	 up	 29.5%	 to	 £16.1m	 (2005:	 £12.4m)	 and	 operating	 profit	 up	 19.9%	 to	 £4.0m	 (2005:	 £3.4m).	 This	 reflects	 increased	 investment	 by	 the	 oil	 majors	 which	 is	 delivering	 higher	 offshore	 exploration	 and	 construction	 activity	 as	 well	 as	 continued	 growth	 in	 Ashtead	 Technology’s	 onshore	 environmental	 business.	 Investment	 	 for	 future	 growth	 included	 a	 significantly	 enlarged	 onshore	 sales	 force	 and	 a	 new	 profit	 centre	 in	 Chicago	 opened	 last	 November.
Exceptional items and fair value remeasurements of  
embedded derivatives
In	 addition	 to	 the	 trading	 results	 discussed	 above,	 operating	 profit	 as	 reported	 in	 the	 consolidated	 income	 statement	 includes	 £13.4m	 of	 	 net	 exceptional	 profits.	 These	 comprise	 the	 £11.3m	 received	 when	 Sunbelt	 settled	 its	 long	 standing	 litigation	 with	 Head	 &	 Engquist	 in	 November	 2005,	 a	 £2.9m	 profit	 on	 disposal	 of	 Sunbelt’s	 12	 scaffold	 stores	 less	 £0.8m	 of	 post	 acquisition	 integration	 costs.	 Included	 	 within	 finance	 costs	 is	 the	 £4.8m	 net	 cost	 of	 last	 summer’s	 capital	 reorganisation,	 mainly	 relating	 to	 the	 12%	 premium	 payable	 on	 the	 £42m	 of	 sterling	 senior	 secured	 notes	 redeemed	 early	 out	 of	 the	 proceeds	 of	 the	 equity	 placing,	 and	 the	 £5.6m	 (2005:	 £9.8m)	 non-cash	 fair	 value	 remeasurements	 of	 embedded	 derivatives	 in	 long	 term	 debt.
Taxation
Overall	 for	 the	 year	 the	 effective	 accounting	 tax	 rate	 on	 the	 underlying	 profit	 was	 31%	 whilst	 the	 cash	 tax	 rate	 on	 the	 same	 basis	 remained	 minimal.	 The	 recent	 increases	 in	 Sunbelt’s	 profitability	 together	 with	 the	 Head	 &	 Engquist	 litigation	 receipt	 means,	 however,	 that	 Sunbelt’s	 US	 federal	 tax	 losses	 have	 now	 been	 fully	 utilised	 and	 that	 consequently	 	 the	 Group’s	 cash	 tax	 rate	 will	 rise	 into	 double	 digits	 next	 year.
Pensions
Funding	 of	 the	 UK	 pension	 plan	 deficit	 as	 announced	 with	 the	 third	 quarter	 results	 was	 completed	 at	 the	 end	 of	 March	 with	 the	 payment	 of	 £17.1m,	 the	 amount	 recommended	 by	 the	 actuary,	 into	 the	 fund.	 As	 a	 result	 the	 Group’s	 pension	 obligations	 are	 now	 fully	 funded.	 Funding	 of	 the	 deficit	 had	 no	 significant	 effect	 on	 the	 Group’s	 income	 statement.
Capital expenditure and net debt
Capital	 expenditure	 in	 the	 year	 was	 £220.2m	 (2005:	 £138.4m)	 of	 which	 £201.8m	 was	 invested	 in	 the	 rental	 fleet.	 £64.5m	 of	 the	 fleet	 expenditure	 was	 for	 growth,	 principally	 in	 Sunbelt,	 with	 the	 remainder	 spent	 to	 replace	 existing	 equipment.	 Disposal	 proceeds	 were	 £50.8m	 (2005:	 £37.6m)	 generating	 a	 profit	 on	 disposal	 of	 £9.1m	 (2005:	 £7.1m).	 As	 indicated	 in	 March,	 capital	 expenditure	 for	 the	 year	 to	 30	 April	 2007	 is	 currently	 expected	 to	 total	 approximately	 £250m.
Net	 debt	 at	 30	 April	 2006	 was	 £493.6m,	 an	 increase	 of	 £11.3m	 since	 	 30	 April	 2005.	 At	 constant	 exchange	 rates	 the	 increase	 over	 the	 year	 was	 £2.5m.	 Net	 debt	 to	 EBITDA	 leverage	 reduced	 from	 2.85x	 a	 year	 ago	 to	 2.2x	 at	 30	 April	 2006.	 Availability	 under	 the	 asset	 based	 loan	 facility	 was	 $283m	 at	 30	 April	 2006	 ($157m	 at	 30	 April	 2005).
Dividends
The	 directors	 intend	 proposing	 to	 shareholders	 at	 the	 Annual	 General	 Meeting	 that	 a	 final	 dividend	 of	 1.0p	 per	 share	 be	 paid	 making	 a	 total	 	 for	 the	 year	 of	 1.5p	 per	 share	 (2005:	 nil).	 Under	 IFRS	 the	 financial	 statements	 now	 reflect	 just	 dividends	 paid	 in	 the	 year	 and	 therefore	 show	 only	 the	 £2.0m	 cost	 of	 the	 interim	 dividend	 paid	 in	 February.	 	 The	 final	 dividend,	 if	 approved	 by	 shareholders,	 will	 be	 paid	 on	 	 28	 September	 2006	 to	 shareholders	 on	 the	 register	 on	 28	 July	 2006.
06	 	 Ashtead Group plc	 Annual	 report	 and	 accounts	 for	 the	 year	 ended	 30	 April	 2006 International	 equipment	 rental Current trading and outlook
All	 three	 of	 our	 businesses	 performed	 well	 in	 the	 past	 year.	 Each	 continues	 to	 benefit	 from	 good	 market	 conditions	 and	 has	 made	 an	 excellent	 start	 to	 the	 new	 financial	 year.
In	 the	 US,	 where	 the	 shift	 from	 ownership	 to	 rental	 continues,	 we	 are	 encouraged	 by	 the	 strength	 of	 the	 non-residential	 construction	 market	 which	 rose	 10%	 in	 the	 12	 months	 to	 April	 2006	 and	 is	 forecast	 to	 grow	 strongly	 for	 at	 least	 the	 next	 two	 years	 and	 by	 Sunbelt’s	 continuing	 gains	 in	 market	 share.	 Revenues	 from	 house	 builders,	 where	 the	 short	 term	 outlook	 is	 less	 certain,	 accounted	 for	 just	 6%	 of	 Sunbelt’s	 revenues	 last	 year.	 The	 restructuring	 of	 A-Plant’s	 sales	 force	 at	 the	 start	 of	 last	 year	 delivered	 benefits	 on	 a	 rising	 scale	 as	 the	 year	 progressed,	 a	 trend	 which	 has	 continued	 into	 our	 new	 financial	 year.
With	 this	 strong,	 broadly-based	 momentum,	 the	 Board	 looks	 forward	 	 to	 reporting	 further	 significant	 progress	 in	 the	 coming	 year.
In	 closing,	 I	 should	 like	 to	 express	 my	 thanks	 to	 everyone	 who	 has	 contributed	 to	 the	 growth	 of	 Ashtead	 Group	 over	 the	 last	 22	 years:	 shareholders,	 suppliers,	 customers	 (without	 whom	 we	 would	 not	 be	 here)	 but	 most	 of	 all	 to	 our	 staff,	 past	 and	 present.	 We	 are	 a	 service	 business	 in	 a	 ‘hard-work’	 industry	 and	 it	 is	 the	 enthusiasm,	 drive	 and	 commitment	 of	 the	 A-Plant,	 Sunbelt	 and	 Ashtead	 Technology	 teams,	 backed	 up	 by	 the	 equally	 capable	 and	 committed	 Ashtead	 Group	 support	 staff,	 that	 makes	 the	 difference.	 My	 appreciation	 and	 best	 wishes	 go	 to	 all	 of	 them.
I	 am	 delighted	 that	 Geoff	 Drabble	 will	 be	 joining	 the	 Group	 in	 an	 executive	 capacity	 in	 October	 and	 very	 much	 look	 forward	 to	 working	 with	 him	 in	 effecting	 a	 seamless	 transition.	 He	 will	 take	 over	 the	 best	 management	 team	 in	 the	 industry	 and	 will	 bring	 both	 a	 sense	 of	 continuity	 and	 fresh	 new	 ideas	 to	 the	 next	 phase	 of	 Ashtead’s	 development.	 I	 wish	 him	 and	 the	 entire	 Board	 every	 success	 in	 taking	 the	 Group	 forward	 to	 what	 I	 am	 sure	 will	 be	 a	 prosperous	 and	 exciting	 future.

 Group highlights
Delivering for our  
customers and shareholders
We achieved good results in 2015 while making progress on implementing our strategy. 
We remained focused on operating efficiency and disciplined underwriting which helped 
us to improve operating profit from ongoing operations.

of 94.0% for 2015, an improvement of 1.0 percentage point
• Return on tangible equity

for continuing operations

 increased to £507.5 million (2014: £456.8 million)
• Results benefited from our disciplined underwriting, prior-year reserve releases from 
ongoing operations of £378.9 million (2014: £397.6 million) which were higher  
than expected, together with lower costs, partially offset by higher claims from  
major weather events and lower volumes
• 4.5% increase in final dividend per share to 9.2 pence per share and additional 
special dividend of 8.8 pence per share. Total dividends for 2015, including  
special interim dividend of 27.5 pence per share following sale of International 
division, of 50.1 pence per share (2014: 27.2 pence per share)
Strategic and operational highlights
• Investment in brand differentiation through further enhancements, a succession  
of initiatives to Direct Line proposition and improved trading capability across  
Churchill and Privilege, particularly on price comparison websites
• Improved customer retention rates for motor and home products, and Net Promoter 
Score for Direct Line brand
• Reduced total costs

 for ongoing operations by 4.6% in 2015 while investing  
in technical pricing, claims management and self-service initiatives
• Doubled Motor telematics insurance in-force policies; and growth in Commercial

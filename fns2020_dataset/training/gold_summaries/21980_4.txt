 Remuneration – at a glance
This section summarises the remuneration outcomes for the 2015/16 year, including how the Remuneration Policy has been 
implemented during the year and the link between remuneration and our strategy.
Our remuneration principles
Our Remuneration Policy is designed to support our overall vision to become the most dynamic, creative and admired soft drinks 
company in the world. At the heart of our vision is our people which the company is required to attract, engage and retain from across 
our global sector. Our remuneration arrangements, therefore, are simply comprised of the two pay components – Fixed and Variable 
pay. Within each of these components the following arrangements above exist.
To determine the shape, size and variability of each element of pay the Committee follow fi ve key remuneration principles:
Competitive market 
positioning and 
opportunity
To attract, retain and engage the executive talent we need to realise our vision and deliver our 
strategy our remuneration arrangements need to be suffi ciently competitive but not excessive.
Pay aligned with 
sustainable long-term 
performance
The mix between both fi xed and variable pay as well as the balance between rewarding short 
versus long-term performance are critical to ensure they are correctly balanced and reward those 
behaviours that will lead to the realisation of our long-term vision without compromise for short-
term gain. In addition, all forms of variable pay are only fully delivered in return for performance 
materially above the standards required by Britvic and our shareholders – in other words the 
superior pay opportunity available can only be realised in return for superior performance.
Incentive metrics aligned 
with our strategy
The performance measures selected to determine both our annual bonus and long-term incentive 
plans have been carefully considered to focus on a simple and effective selection of those key 
drivers of our strategy and long-term value creation for our shareholders, (see below).
Alignment of executive 
and shareholder interests
To ensure the continued alignment of executive and shareholder interests, the greatest potential 
pay opportunity for executives is via our long-term incentive plans. Awards are based in shares 
and are dependent on a balance of absolute and relative growth in long-term value creation 
for shareholders. In particular, the mix of share options and performance shares is designed to 
ensure that executives are only rewarded for superior market performance and the realisation of 
our vision. This is further reinforced by meaningful shareholding guidelines for executives so that 
their long-term wealth remains tied to Britvic’s sustained long-term success.
Mindful of our 
wider stakeholder 
responsibilities 
In support of our vision our Executive Directors’ pay arrangement are not only focused on 
fi nancial returns but also mindful of performance against our wider long-term stakeholder goals. 
The Committee takes great care to set appropriate targets that do not compromise our wider 
stakeholder aspirations. Both malus and claw-back provisions are in place to address potential 
inappropriate actions or risk taking when determining incentive plan pay outs.

Summary of implementation of the Remuneration Policy for 2016/17
The implementation of the Remuneration Policy for 2016/17 is based on 4 key pillars of our strategy:
COMMUNITY
Outside of bonus, our senior 
leaders have individual  
objectives designed to  
support trust and respect  
in the community 
EPS GROWTH
Sustainable long-term earnings 
per share (EPS) growth is 
aligned with long-term value 
creation for our shareholders.
The PSP also has a ROIC  
underpin to ensure long-term 
returns are value enhancing
TSR GROWTH
Long term share price and  
dividend growth that determine 
T otal Shareholder Returns (TSR)  
are heavily dependent on  
consistent long-term EPS  
growth performance. 
PROFIT 
Growing the profits our 
core businesses allows us to 
invest in our various longer 
term growth initiatives. For 
bonus purposes we use

John Gibney’s pay on retirement 
John Gibney stepped down from the board on 27 January 2016 
and retired from the company on 5 April 2016. John was paid up 
to his date of departure. John received a pro-rated bonus in 
respect of 2015/16 and his outstanding awards under the ESOP 
and PSP will vest at the normal vesting date on a pro-rated 
basis, subject to the achievement of the relevant performance 
conditions. John did not receive a 2015/16 ESOP or PSP award 
due to his departure, nor did he receive a salary increase on 1 
January 2016. John had a deferred pension under the defined 
benefit pension and also the Britvic Executive Top Up Scheme 
(BETUS), the company’s unfunded retirement benefits scheme. 
Both of these were closed to future accrual on 10 April 2011. 
John became entitled to payments from the deferred pension 
from his date of retirement and elected to cash out of the BETUS 
in exchange for any future pension entitlement under this 
scheme. No additional payments were made to John as a result 
of his departure. 
Full details of John’s pay prior to him stepping down from the 
Board are set out in the Single Total Figure of Remuneration. 
Details of payments for the period from him stepping down from 
the Board up to his retirement, including pension payments, are 
set out in the Payments to Past Directors disclosure on page 74.
Mathew Dunn’s pay on appointment 
Mathew Dunn was appointed to the position of CFO on 25 
November 2015. Mathew’s pay is in line with the Remuneration 
Policy. As part of his recruitment, Mathew received a relocation 
allowance with a net value of £56,148 (which was within the 
maximum net allowance of £70,000) to assist in his move from 
South Africa to the UK as previously communicated in the RNS 
announcement. No other payments were made to Mathew on 
his recruitment to compensate for awards forgone from his 
previous employer or otherwise. 
Whilst no salary increase is to be awarded to Mathew Dunn in 
January 2017, the Committee has previously stated in last year’s 
Directors’ Remuneration Report that Mathew may receive a 
salary increase higher than that of the wider employee population 
in the first 3 years following appointment subject to performance.

Illustration of the application of Remuneration Policy
As described in the remuneration principles section on page 61 the 
Committee believes that our executive remuneration packages should 
provide a significant part of total potential pay based on performance. 
Set out below are the potential total pay outcomes for both Executive 
Directors across three alternative performance scenarios under the current 
Remuneration Policy. The three scenarios are minimum, on-target and 
maximum performance, respectively. For simplicity, the illustrations below  
are calculated before any change in share price and roll-up of dividends.

 The chart has been prepared using the following assumptions:
1)  Base salaries as at 1 January 2017
2)  Benefits reflect those estimated to be paid in 2016/17
3)  Target bonus is calculated at 50% of maximum opportunity 
4)   Target vesting for the PSP is 60%, being the mid-point between 
threshold and maximum vesting level 
5)   Options awarded under the ESOP are valued on the standard 
market value for options of 30% of the face value of award. A 
target vesting of 60% values the ESOP award at 18% of the 
maximum value

The implementation of the Remuneration Policy described above applies specifically to Executive Directors. Where possible, principles 
set out in the policy have been applied to all employees to achieve alignment as per the below table:
Element Application of policy for other employees
Base salary Paid in cash and reviewed annually, normally taking effect 1 January. Salaries are set with reference to 
internal pay levels, as well as local market competitiveness compared to roles of a similar nature and 
size of responsibility.
Benefits Britvic provide local market typical benefits focused on employee health and wellbeing. The majority 
of employees participate in the company’s flexible benefits plan.
Pension Subject to local market practice and regulations. 
GB employees have rights under the GB legacy defined benefit pension arrangement which is now 
closed to future accrual (the plan was closed to executives at the same time). A defined contribution 
pension was introduced following the closure of the defined benefit pension in which UK employees 
are entitled to participate in.
Annual bonus Approximately 250 leaders and senior managers participate in bonus arrangements with measures 
aligned to that of the executive directors. Typically, all other employees are eligible to receive a bonus 
linked to profit and revenue of the company as well as their individual performance.
Long term  
incentives
The performance share plan is awarded to approximately 90 leaders globally each year. Approximately 
15 leaders also receive options under the executive share option plan. Performance conditions for both 
awards are linked to those of the executive directors.
All employee  
share plans
Where possible, we offer employees annual free share awards linked to company performance as well 
as the opportunity to purchase Britvic shares. In some locations, alternative profit sharing arrangements 
are available, depending on local market practices and legislation.
The value of each element the employee may receive will vary according to the employee’s seniority and level of responsibility.

PwC were appointed as advisors to the Committee in August 
2014. The company is also advised by PwC on other 
remuneration-related items and provided consulting support on 
non-remuneration related issues. PwC is a member of the 
Remuneration Consultants Group (the professional body for 
executive remuneration consultants). PwC’s fees in respect of 
advice to the Committee in the year under review were £40,100 
and were charged on the basis of that firm’s standard terms of 
business for advice provided.
The Committee also received advice from Willis Towers Watson 
during the year the fees for which were £12,000 and were 
charged on the basis of that firm’s standard terms of business  
for advice provided. Willis Towers Watson also provide support to 
the company on other remuneration-related items.
During the year, Addleshaw Goddard LLP were also engaged by 
the Committee to provide legal advice on contractual 
arrangements and share schemes.
Unless otherwise stated, these advisors have no other 
connection with the company and the Committee, based on its 
experience, is satisfied that the advice it received from these 
organisations was objective and independent. 
 
Statement of implementation of Remuneration Policy in the following year
The Remuneration Policy approved at the January 2015 AGM 
will continue to be implemented from the commencement 
of the new financial year (2016/17) as follows:
Base salary
In recognition of the increasingly challenging economic and 
commercial environment ahead in 2016/17, the Committee 
determined that no salary increases should be awarded to the 
CEO and CFO in January 2017. 
2016

2017

Increase
Simon Litherland 600.0 600.0 0%
Mathew Dunn 340.0 340.0 0%
Benefits and pension
Implemented in line with policy.
Annual Bonus 
Implemented in line with policy. The bonus measures¹ and 
weightings for 2016/17 are: 
• Profit before tax and amortisation (50%)
• Total Net Revenue (20%)
• Net Revenue from Innovation (10%)
• Underlying free cash flow (20%)
Target award amounts for the CEO and CFO are 70% and 60% 
of base salary and maximum award values are 140% and 120% 
of base salary, respectively. 
The Committee has introduced an additional metric into the 
annual bonus for 2016/17 - net revenue from innovation. This will 
have a 10% weight in the annual bonus and will sit alongside the 
total net revenue measure with a 20% weighting. This is to reflect 
the long-term importance of innovation to the growth strategy of 
the company and so an increasing focus for 2016/17 was 
considered appropriate by the Committee. 
The Committee is of the view that the performance targets under 
the bonus plan are commercially sensitive and that it would be 
detrimental to the interests of the company to disclose them 
before the start of the financial year. Disclosure of targets in 
advance could lead the company to be at a disadvantage as 
many competitors are not subject to the same levels of 
disclosure. Targets and the performance against them will be 
disclosed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report following the 
end of the financial year.
Note: 
1.    Performance measures defined as follows: 
Profit Before Tax and amortisation (PBTA) - measured before exceptional 
and other items on a budget currency basis
  Total Net Revenue and Net Revenue from Innovation - measured on a 
constant currency basis.
  Underlying free cash flow - measured excluding movements in borrowings, 
dividend payments, exceptional and other items.
Long-term incentive plans (PSP and ESOP)
As set out in the Chairman’s letter at the front of this report, the 
current and forward looking customer environment and price 
deflation in our core markets present potential challenges to the 
business. In addition we are now dealing with greater uncertainty 
and unfavourable exchange rate movements following the EU 
referendum outcome. The result of this is that growth 
expectations and consensus estimates for the business have 
reduced such that the established EPS target range would be 
unrealistic to achieve. The Committee, therefore, wants to ensure 
that the LTIP remains incentivising and relevant to the executive 
directors whilst at the same time sufficiently stretching and 
aligned with shareholder interests. During the second half of the 
year the Committee consulted with a number of the company’s 
larger shareholders to agree a new EPS target range for the LTIP 
awards in 2016/17. This consultation exercise concluded with a 
decision to adopt a new three-year EPS range for LTIP awards 
made in 2016/17 of 3% to 8% per annum growth and a 
commitment to undertake a holistic review of Remuneration 
Policy in the summer of 2017.

Notes:
1 The values shown for John Gibney are in respect of services as an executive director up to him stepping off the board on 27 January 2016.
Simon Litherland’s, Mathew Dunn’s, and John Gibney’s normal retirement age is 60. Mathew Dunn receives a contribution to the 
Defined Contribution section of the Britvic Pension Plan up to the HMRC annual allowance each tax year. The balance of his 
entitlement is paid as a cash allowance.
The cash allowance payable to the executives:
• Reflects contributions the company would have made to the defined contribution section of the Plan had these individuals elected 
to join, less a deduction to ensure the cash allowance is cost neutral to the company from a National Insurance perspective. 
• Was paid at a rate of 24.6% of pensionable pay (base salary only) for Simon Litherland, 22.0% of pensionable pay (base salary only) 
for John Gibney and 4.7% for Mathew Dunn.
John Gibney had a deferred pension in the defined benefit section of the Plan and was a member of the Britvic Executive Top Up 
Scheme (‘BETUS’), the company’s unfunded retirement benefits scheme.
Both the Plan and BETUS were closed to future accrual on 10 April 2011. 
On his retirement, John commenced receipt of his deferred pension. John received a cash lump sum of £375,000 and is entitled to an 
annual pension payable for life of £139,363. John elected to cash out of BETUS and received a cash sum of £1,055,848 in exchange 
for any further entitlement under BETUS.
iv) Annual bonus (subject to audit) - Corresponds to the total bonus earned under the bonus plan in respect of 2016 performance.

Notes:
1. The EPS outcome is calculated excluding the impact of the share placement and ebba acquisition in July 2015 as the award was made prior to this occurring. 
2. Mathew Dunn joined the Company on 25 November 2015 and therefore was not granted a 2013 LTIP award. 
3. John Gibney retired on 5 April 2016. John’s ESOP and PSP will vest at the normal vesting date on a pro-rated basis to reflect his service up to the point of 
retirement. As vesting occurs after his retirement date, the value of his LTIP is declared in the ‘payments to past directors’ section on page 74.
4. The combined PSP and ESOP vesting values were estimated at £342,235 for Simon Litherland and £192,906 for John Gibney.
5. A share price estimate of £6.30 was used to calculate the value of the above awards which is based on the average share price over the last quarter of the 
financial year.
6. The relative TSR comparator group is made up of the following 18 companies; AG Barr plc, Associated British Foods, C&C Group, Dairy Crest, Diageo, Fuller

compared with the percentage change in the weighted average of each of those components for all full-time equivalent employees 
based in Great Britain (GB). The GB employee workforce was chosen as a suitable comparator group as the CEO is based in GB 
(albeit with a global role and responsibilities) and pay changes across the Group vary widely depending on local market conditions.
In recognition of the increasingly challenging economic commercial environment in which the business operates no salary increases 
will be awarded to the CEO and CFO for 2016/2017.

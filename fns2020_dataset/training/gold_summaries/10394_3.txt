Chairman’s statement
Overview
Our strategy to focus on organic growth 
and develop our integrated facilities 
and energy management capabilities 
is progressing exceptionally well. 
This is a reﬂection of the signiﬁcant and 
continuous investments we have made 
in key sectors over the last few years. 
During the year we saw the award of 
a number of transformational contracts 
which have enhanced our business. 
Our energy capability is now a core 
part of our client proposition and we 
are the second largest energy services 
company in the UK. 
This has resulted in strong organic 
revenue and operating proﬁt growth 
during the year. More importantly, 
we are well placed to deliver further 
organic growth in these key areas 
going forward, as is evident in both our 
record order book and large pipeline 
of sales opportunities. 
We have also made a number of 
niche acquisitions which will help us 
to enter new and specialist markets. 
Utilyx provides a specialist energy 
and carbon consultancy and Direct 
Enquiries is the UK’s leading access 
and disability consultancy. True to 
our entrepreneurial roots, we continue 
to use the original MITIE Model to 
start and grow innovative businesses 
and it remains a key differentiator for 
the group. 
These developments leave us in a 
strong position as we enter the new 
ﬁnancial year.
A transformational year… 
and strong organic growth
This has been a transformational 25th year for MITIE, 
with excellent progress on all of our key strategic objectives, 
and sector-leading organic growth.

 Cobra Biomanufacturing Plc 3
Chairman’s Statement
(1) Signed contracted order book at 1 October 2008 plus contracted orders
signed from 1 October 2008 to 25 March 2009, excluding unconfirmed
revenue for the existing GenVec, Inc contract
Financial Summary 2008
The financial results for 2008 fell into two distinct phases.  The
first half year saw a continuation of the difficult trading
encountered in the previous six months with revenue of only
£2.7m (H1 2007: £5.3m); However, the second half showed the
beginnings of a recovery with revenues of £4.3m (H2 2007:
£3.9m); and full year revenue of £7.0m (2007: £9.2m). The loss
after tax was £3.3m (2007: £1.8m). 
In response to the difficult trading environment the Group
has maintained a rigorous control of costs and cash. This
included a headcount reduction, recruitment delays and a
senior management restructuring which along with the
introduction of cross functional training to achieve a more
flexible multi-tasking workforce capability, will result in
significant annualised cost savings and increased efficiency as
we enter the new financial year. The Group also refocused its
marketing effort which alongside the recent strengthening of
both the US Dollar and the Euro has contributed to a secured
contracted order book of £11m
(1)
, 17% higher than the figure
announced in our results this time last year (January 2008:
£9.4m). £7.7m of these orders are scheduled for delivery in
the current financial year which compared with £6m this time
last year; this represents a meaningful turnaround and
ensures that financial stability is being maintained.
Management
On 18 January 2008, we announced the appointment of
Simon Saxby as Chief Operating Officer and at the same time
David Thatcher stepped down as Chief Executive, to become
a Non Executive Director of the Group as well as acting as a
consultant for Cobra Oral Technologies Limited (‘COT’), a
subsidiary focused on our oral vaccines project. These
management changes evolved further during the year with
Simon Saxby then stepping up to become Chief Executive in
June 2008 as I stepped down to become Non Executive
Chairman later in the year.
Subsequently David Thatcher retired as a Non Executive
Director on 17 January 2009 and the other Board Directors
wish to acknowledge his ongoing contribution to the business
not only over this last 12 months, with the evolution of COT
which pending results from on going studies that should be
available in the first half of the calendar year 2009, may have
potential value, but also for the growth and development of
the contract manufacturing business started in 1998.
Placing
In June 2008 we were able to raise £1m (net of expenses)
through a placing of shares with existing large shareholders
to provide funds for working capital and essential capital
expenditure. The Directors would like to thank once again
both our major institutional and private investors for their
continued support. The placing was approved at the EGM on
30 May 2008 and resulted in Mr and Mrs Dixon becoming our
largest shareholders with 43.9% of the ordinary share capital.
Outlook
There continues to be global economic uncertainty affecting
all markets, including those for biopharmaceuticals,
exemplified by the contract variation included in the
operational update.  However, our expertise gives Cobra a
competitive advantage which has resulted in a secured
contracted order book of £11m
(1)
(18 January 2008: £9.4m).
We will continue to proactively control our costs and
maximise revenue and cashflow.

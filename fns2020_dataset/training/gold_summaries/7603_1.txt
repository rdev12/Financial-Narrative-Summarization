management	 facility	 in	 Fordoun,	
Scotland.	 A further	 £18.1m	 expansion	
of	 the	 Group’s	 Aberdeen	
manufacturing	 plant	 also	 began	 in	
the	 third	 quarter	 of	 2010	 and	 the	
Group	 invested	 £3.9m	 in	 land	 in	
Houma,	 Louisiana	 for	 a	 facility	 to	
serve	 Gulf	 of	 Mexico	 operations.
Within	 Well	 Intervention,	 plans	 were	
initiated	 on	 a	 £13.8m	 expansion	
at	 National	 Coupling’s	 facility	 in	
Stafford,	 Texas.
Hunting	 Energy	 Services	 now	 has	
over	 30	 sites	 around	 the	 globe,	 which	
provide	 the	 Group	 with	 an	
operational	 capability	 in	 most	 regions	
of	 significant	 oil	 and	 gas	 activity.
The	 Group	 also	 continued	 to	 build	 its	
Exploration	 and	 Production	 business,	
where	 £7.1m	 was	 invested	 during	 the	
year	 (2009	 –	 £1.9m).
In	 September	 2010,	 the	 Group	
completed	 the	 largest	 acquisition	 in	
its	 history	 with	 the	 purchase	 of	
Innova-Extel	 Holdings	 Inc.,	 a	
Houston,	 Texas	 based	 manufacturer	
of	 harsh	 environment	 electronic	
products,	 for	 a	 consideration	 of	 	
£80.3m.	 The	 business,	 now	
rebranded	 Hunting	 Innova,	 is	 a	 key	
addition	 to	 the	 Well	 Construction	
division	 and	 brings	 to	 the	 Group	 a	
new	 dimension	 of	 proprietary	
products	 that	 increase	 Logging	 and	
Measurement-While-Drilling	
capabilities,	 by	 adding	 electronics	 to	
the	 core	 mechanical	 engineering	
competence.	 Hunting	 Innova,	 along	
with	 the	 other	 recent	 acquisitions,	
manufactures	 higher	 margin	
technology-driven	 products.
Business Development
The	 Group’s	 strong	 financial	 result	
was	 achieved	 in	 part	 through	
increases	 in	 its	 operational	 footprint	
during	 2010,	 with	 the	 opening	 of	 new	
facilities	 in	 key	 markets.	 The	 Group	
increased	 capital	 expenditure	 to	
£49.7m	 in	 2010,	 from	 £21.6m	 in	 2009,	
reflecting	 opportunities	 afforded	
through	 investing	 for	 future	 growth	
especially	 in	 Hunting	 Energy	 Services	
where	 the	 Group	 invested	 £48.7m	
(2009	 –	 £21.1m).	 Within	 the	 Group	
figure,	 new	 business	 development	
comprised	 £36.8m	 (2009	 –	 £11.7m)	
and	 replacement	 expenditure	 was	
£12.9m	 (2009	 –	 £9.9m).
Within	 Well	 Construction,	 the	
Drilling	 Tools	 business	 opened	 a	 new	
regional	 centre	 in	 Latrobe,	
Pennsylvania,	 to	 take	 advantage	 of	
drilling	 activity	 in	 the	 Marcellus	 shale	
gas	 play	 where	 the	 introduction	 of	
new	 recovery	 techniques	 make	
drilling	 and	 production	 attractive	
even	 at	 the	 low	 prices	 for	 natural	 gas	
of	 under	 US$5/Mcf.	 New	 drilling	 tool	
facilities	 in	 Conroe,	 Texas	 and	
Casper,	 Wyoming	 have	 also	 been	
opened	 to	 service	 the	 US	 Gulf	 coast	
states	 and	 the	 Bakken	 shale	
respectively.	 The	 Group	 invested	 a	
total	 of	 £20.6m	 in	 this	 growing	
business	 line.	
A	 new	 manufacturing	 facility	 in	
Wuxi,	 China	 became	 operational	
during	 the	 year	 (a	 £4.7m	 investment),	
which	 aims	 to	 serve	 the	 fast	 growing	
demand	 for	 our	 products	 in	 China.
Within	 Well	 Completion,	 the	 Group	
completed	 phase	 2	 of	 the	 expansion	
of	 the	 tubular	 inventory	 and	
2010	 has	 been	 a	 strong	 year	 of	
recovery	 for	 Hunting	 and	 also	 one	 of	
continuing	 transformation	 as	 the	
Group	 positions	 itself	 to	 respond	 to	
accelerating	 demand	 from	 emerging	
regions	 and	 technically	 challenging	
resource	 plays.	 The	 Group	 has	
invested	 heavily	 in	 its	 operations	 and	
successfully	 completed	 a	 key	
acquisition,	 two	 core	 ingredients	 of	
its	 strategy	 for	 growth,	 while	 also	
increasing	 the	 number	 of	 touch	
points	 for	 Hunting’s	 products	 that	
service	 the	 wellbore	 for	 oil	 and	 gas	
companies	 throughout	 the	 world.
The	 year	 has	 seen	 a	 stabilisation	 of	
the	 global	 economic	 outlook	 which	
has	 led	 to	 many	 energy	 companies	
increasing	 capital	 expenditure	
programmes,	 resulting	 in	 a	
corresponding	 increase	 in	 activity	
levels	 in	 all	 of	 Hunting’s	 energy	
related	 operations.	 The	 oil	 price	 has	
recovered	 from	 its	 lows	 of	 2009	 and	
sustained	 an	 increase	 of	 15%	 during	
2010	 and	 is	 now	 trending	 towards	
US$100/barrel,	 which	 has	 provided	 a	
stable	 and	 encouraging	 investment	
environment.	 As	 a	 consequence,	
North	 American	 rig	 counts	 reported	
a	 39%	 increase	 during	 the	 year,	
indicating	 a	 return	 to	 a	 robust	 growth	
trend	 in	 energy	 demand.
Against	 this	 backdrop,	 the	 Group	
achieved	 an	 impressive	 28%	 increase	
in	 revenue	 in	 the	 year	 to	 £461.6m	
(2009	 –	 £359.9m)	 and	 a	 30%	
increase	 in	 profit	 before	 tax,	 from	
continuing	 operations	 before	
exceptional	 items,	 of	 £50.0m	 	
(2009	 –	 £38.5m).	 Profit	 before	 tax	
from	 continuing	 operations	 was	
£38.5m	 (2009	 –	 £39.1m).

Chief Executive’s Review continued
The	 integration	 during	 the	 year	 of	
Welltonic	 enhances	 the	 Well	
Intervention	 platform	 by	 broadening	
the	 product	 lines	 into	 thru-tubing	
technology	 for	 the	 coiled	 tubing	
market,	 providing	 synergies	 in	
engineering	 services	 with	 the	 existing	
range,	 and	 providing	 a	 permanent	
manufacturing	 base	 in	 the	 Middle	
East.	 This	 now	 acts	 as	 a	 regional	 hub	
and	 combines	 the	 other	 divisional	
sales	 operation	 in	 Dubai,	 UAE.
During	 the	 year,	 the	 Group	
established	 Hunting	 Equipment	
Management	 Services	 (“HEMS”),	 a	
drilling	 tool	 rental	 and	 management	
services	 unit,	 operating	 from	 a	
customised	 facility	 in	 Aberdeen,	
Scotland.	 HEMS,	 which	 is	 reported	
as	 part	 of	 the	 Well	 Construction	
segment,	 provides	 an	 additional	
range	 of	 Bottom	 Hole	 Assembly	
Drilling	 Equipment	 alongside	
Hunting’s	 proprietary	 products	 to	 an	
existing	 customer	 base,	 as	 well	 as	
providing	 opportunity	 for	 targeted	
growth	 throughout	 the	 eastern	
hemisphere.
Health, Safety and the Environment
With	 new	 acquisitions	 and	 facilities,	
Hunting	 Energy	 Services	 added	 over	
800,000 sq ft	 of	 manufacturing	
footprint	 to	 the	 Group	 bringing	 the	
total	 to	 approximately	 2 million sq ft.	
During	 2010,	 the	 number	 of	
recordable	 incidents	 was	 57	
compared	 to	 22	 in	 2009.	 The	 Group	
continues	 to	 enhance	 its	 Health	 and	
Safety	 policies	 as	 it	 adds	 new	
facilities.
All	 of	 Hunting	 Energy	 Services’	 major	
manufacturing	 facilities	 are	 ISO	
14001	 Environmental	 Management	
Systems	 certified	 and	 at	 the	 year	 end	
Hunting’s	 Rankin	 Road	 facility	
received	 ISO	 18001	 certification	 for	
its	 Health	 and	 Safety	 practices	 –	 the	
first	 in	 the	 world	 to	 be	 so	 accredited	
by	 the	 American	 Petroleum	 Institute.

reputation	 for	 reliability	 and	 on	 time	
delivery	 under	 the	 Hunting	 brand.
Business Model
The	 key	 features	 of	 the	 Group’s	
business	 model	 which	 seeks	 to	
deliver	 the	 strategic	 objectives	 are:
	 > A	 decentralised	 management	
structure	 allowing	 local	
management	 to	 identify	 and	 react	
to	 customer	 or	 local	 market	
requirements.
	 > Close	 monitoring,	 support	 and	
direction	 from	 the	 centre.
	 > Short	 chains	 of	 command	 allowing	
for	 faster	 decision	 making.
	 > Framework	 of	 controls	 with	
discretionary	 limits	 and	 powers	 for	
local	 management.
	 > Flexible	 cost	 structures	 which	 can	
adapt	 to	 market	 conditions.
	 > Common	 standards	 for	 quality,	
health	 and	 safety	 across	
operations.
Maintaining	 high	 operational	
standards	 across	 all	 of	 the	 Group’s	
activities	 is	 viewed	 as	 one	 of	 the	
building	 blocks	 in	 delivering	 a	 strong	
financial	 performance.
national	 oil	 companies	 and	 the	 major	
operating	 companies	 who	 service	
them.	 In	 Asia-Pacific,	 the	
requirement	 for	 energy	 and	
increasing	 drilling	 activity	 should	 	
see	 continued	 demand	 placed	 	
upon	 the	 Group’s	 regional	
manufacturing	 facilities	 into	 the	
foreseeable	 future.	
These	 drivers	 will	 contribute	 to	 the	
ongoing	 demand	 for	 Hunting’s	
products	 and	 services.	 With	 the	
continuing	 internal	 investment	
programme	 under	 way,	
improvements	 in	 operating	
efficiencies	 will	 be	 developed	 as	 the	
various	 initiatives	 are	 completed.	
Sustained	 or	 increased	 activity	 in	 all	
our	 key	 regions	 of	 operation	 will	
drive	 momentum	 in	 the	 year	 and	
with	 the	 recent	 acquisitions	 fully	
integrated,	 Hunting	 is	 well	 positioned	
to	 continue	 its	 growth.	
Business Strategy
The	 key	 elements	 of	 the	 Group’s	
business	 strategy	 to	 deliver	 long-term	
shareholder	 value	 remain:
	 > To	 deliver	 both	 acquisitive	 and	
organic	 growth	 across	 all	 of	 the	
Group’s	 core	 operations.	
	 > To	 invest	 and	 develop	 the	 business	
platforms	 to	 augment:
	 – 		 proprietary	 products	 and	
services;
	 – 		 increased	 market	 share	 strength;
	 – 		 enlarged	 global	 footprint;	 and
	 – 		 capture	 of	 synergies	 from	 the	
opportunities	 thus	 created.
Underpinning	 these	 strategic	
objectives	 is	 a	 commitment	 to	
manufacture	 and	 deliver	 high	 quality	
products	 and	 services	 with	 a	
Outlook
The	 oil	 and	 gas	 industry	 continues	 to	
be	 driven	 by	 fundamental	
commodity	 economics	 and	 as	
demonstrated	 in	 North	 America,	 	
is	 susceptible	 to	 influence	 from	
political	 and	 other	 technical	 factors.	
With	 strengthening	 oil	 prices,	 strong	
demand	 from	 emerging	 economies	
and	 record	 capital	 expenditures	
forecast	 by	 the	 industry,	 the	 increase	
in	 momentum	 seen	 in	 2010	 will	
likely	 continue	 through	 2011.	
Increasing	 crude	 oil	 supply	 remains	 a	
challenge	 as	 new	 oil	 discoveries	 have	
been	 offset	 by	 increasing	 depletion	
rates	 in	 maturing	 fields.	 Better	
production	 technologies	 have	
allowed	 operators	 to	 produce	
reservoirs	 more	 quickly,	 boosting	
investment	 returns.	 However,	
accelerating	 production	 requires	 new	
fields	 to	 be	 brought	 online	 more	
quickly	 to	 counter	 sharper	 decline	
rates	 of	 productive	 fields.	 With	 most	
new	 discoveries	 in	 deeper,	 harsh	 or	
remote	 locations,	 many	 of	 the	 new	
offshore	 rigs	 being	 built	 are	 high-
capability	 rigs,	 which	 require	 higher	
quality	 rig	 equipment	 and	
completion	 products.	 Gas	 shale	
drilling	 in	 North	 America	 remains	
buoyant	 as	 companies	 seek	 to	 fulfil	
lease	 commitments	 and	 a	 positive	
commodity	 price	 and	 investment	
climate	 will	 benefit	 the	 continued	
development	 of	 oil	 shale.	 With	 a	
renewed	 appetite	 in	 the	 North	 Sea	
for	 oil	 exploration	 and	 improved	
recovery	 prospects	 for	 production,	
activity	 levels	 in	 Europe	 look	
increasingly	 positive.	 The	 Middle	
East	 continues	 to	 provide	 a	 	
growing	 share	 of	 work	 from	 the

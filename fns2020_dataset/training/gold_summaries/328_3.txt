“Management’s strategy of broadening routes to market
is proving to be successful in generating growth.”
Overview
I am pleased to report that AMS has
made considerable progress during
2004. Group turnover of £11.0 million
was up 22% on prior year with growth
being achieved across both business
units, Advanced Woundcare and Wound
Closure, and all geographic regions. 
The broadening of its routes to market
offers a win-win situation for AMS, its
customers and its partners. Improved
revenues and margins are available to
AMS from offering a generic woundcare
range direct to the NHS in the UK and
through private label distributors in
overseas markets. These generic
products address the increasing cost
pressures on healthcare budgets and the
savings made by customers allow them
to purchase new generation products.
The Group continues to fund the
development of new differentiated
products for licensing to its major
woundcare partners for sale under their
leading brands.
Pre-tax losses were halved to £1.0
million. Post-tax losses were reduced to
£0.4 million following recognition of
R&D tax credits and deferred tax assets.
The Group reached EBITDA break-even.
This is a major milestone in moving the
Group to profitability.
Operating Review
The Group’s core focus remains the
development and manufacture of
advanced woundcare and wound closure
products for sale in hospitals and long-
term care facilities. Advanced woundcare
products are marketed and distributed
into the $1.5 billion global market
through either major woundcare
companies, such as 3M, Johnson &
Johnson, Smith & Nephew and
Mölnlycke, under their leading brands, or
through private label distributors such as
Cardinal Health. Products based upon
super-glue technology address the
emerging tissue adhesives segment of
the $5 billion wound closure market.
This market is currently accessed
through a direct sales force in the UK
and through distribution partners in
Europe. The direct UK sales force also
carries a full range of standard advanced
woundcare products for sale into the
NHS hospital and community care
markets under our ActivHeal
®
brand.
The Group has made steady progress in
reducing its dependence on the
performance of its major branded
partners for delivering revenue growth
and profit. The strategy of broadening its
routes to market by complementing
these relationships with the provision of
private label standard products to major
distributors and expanding its direct
sales presence in the UK home market is
proving to be successful.
Chairman’s Statement 3
Advanced Woundcare
Sales of £8.9 million were up 20%,
double the current woundcare market
growth rate. This growth was spread
across partners in Europe and the US
and provides a solid business base for
the future. New partners were added
during the period with the Group
establishing a broad presence in the
important Far East market.
The launch of our fibre based silver
alginate technology into the US and
Europe by Johnson & Johnson Wound
Management under their SilverCel™
brand provides AMS with a strong entry
into this dynamic market segment.
Silver is a broad spectrum antimicrobial
that helps to prevent infection. In
combination with alginate, a biopolymer
derived from seaweed, AMS can provide
products ideally suited to treat a wide
variety of acute and chronic wounds.
The three-year agreement with Cardinal
Health announced in July is a major step
forward in building our private label
business. AMS will provide a full range
of advanced woundcare products for
Cardinal Health, for US distribution,
under its Allegiance
®
brand.
The inclusion of our ActivHeal
®
advanced
woundcare range on the NHS contracts
for England and Scotland at the year end
was earlier than expected and illustrates
the commitment of the NHS to cost
management of woundcare budgets.
Response to our offering from senior
management, purchasing officers and
pharmacists of hospital Trusts has been
very positive and conversion on the back
of technical and clinical evaluations at
the user level is already under way in a
number of centres.
ActivHeal
®
AMS is a leading provider of advanced
woundcare products for sale through
marketing and distribution partners
under their brands or private labels.
In response to cost constraints on
woundcare budgets, AMS has put
together a range of standard products
under the ActivHeal
®
brand that offers
significant savings to end users without
compromising quality.
The range is sold directly into the NHS
in our UK home market.
This approach allows healthcare
providers a cost management strategy
whereby savings made on the use of
these standard products for routine
procedures, allow funding of higher
technology products for problematic
wounds.

“The Group is well positioned to grow and to
reach profitability within current cash.”
Wound Closure
The tissue adhesive business continues
to show good growth with sales up 33%
at £2.1 million maintaining our market
leadership position in the use of
adhesives in the UK Accident and
Emergency (A&E) arena. Adhesives are
routinely used for closing facial and
scalp wounds, particularly children’s,
and our LiquiBand™ product is being
used to close around 30,000 wounds per
month in the UK.
The launch of SkinLink™, an anchored
adhesive strip, has strengthened our
product portfolio and allows us to
address the majority of wounds
traditionally closed with stitches, staples
and adhesive strips.
The introduction of LiquiBand Surgical™
throughout Europe during 2004 for
closure of surgical incisions in the
operating room arena has taken our
adhesive technology into the largest
segment of the $5 billion wound 
closure market.
Outlook
The outlook for the Group remains
positive. With an established business
base covering leading edge advanced
woundcare and wound closure products
and technology, and a direct sales team
focusing on the UK home market
supported by strong branded and private
label partners, the Group is well
positioned to continue to grow and to
reach profitability within current cash.
Whilst the prime focus remains taking
the Group through to sustainable
profitability, the Board continues to
review all strategic options to increase
shareholder value.
I would like to thank all AMS employees
for their efforts over the past year.
The Group looks forward to delivering a
high value woundcare technology
company for our stakeholders.

LiquiBand™
Super-glue based medical adhesives
are a relatively recent innovation for
closing wounds. These have evolved to
a point where they are now used to
close and seal the outer skin layer of a
wide variety of trauma and surgical
wounds as an alternative to sutures,
staples and adhesive strips.
LiquiBand™ tissue adhesive was first
introduced in the late 1990’s in the UK
and is now market leader in the
Accident and Emergency (A&E) area
with over 30,000 wounds being closed
per month.
Developments in the adhesive,
methods of application and the
sterilisation process have led to a wide
range of products now being available
for sale in A&E and Operating Rooms
throughout Europe.

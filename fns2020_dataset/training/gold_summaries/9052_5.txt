Business review
UK Service Operations
By exploiting our expertise in providing high 
quality water and waste services, over the past 
year we have made good progress in growing 
our non-regulated business.
UK Service Operations
UK Service Operations comprises KWS, Safe-Move
and Loop. The turnover from these non- regulated
businesses, including our share of associates’ 
and joint ventures’ turnover, increased by £64.3m
to £123.6m (2005: £59.3m). Operating profit
increased to £9.1m (2005: £6.4m) mainly reflecting
the continuing strong operating performances of
existing businesses and also the inclusion of the
first year of the waste water operations contract
with Welsh Water.
Kelda Water Services
In 2005/06 KWS consolidated its position as a leading
company in the UK water and waste water operations
and maintenance market. With turnover of £113.4m
(2005: £49.4m) KWS now contributes 14% of the
group’s turnover from continuing operations.
A consortium, including KWS, has entered into 
a contract with the Water Service of Northern
Ireland to design, build, finance and operate water
treatment facilities that will supply 50% of Northern
Ireland’s water . This 25 year contract of approximately
£500m was signed in May 2006 and will commence
operations in 2008.
All of the existing KWS businesses continue to
perform well. The contract to provide waste water
operations and maintenance services to Welsh
Water commenced on 1 April 2005. The contract
involves the operations of 570 waste water plants
and over 13,000km of sewer network. KWS (Wales)
is a 100% subsidiary of KWS. KWS is also a 50%
shareholder in Brey Utilities Ltd which is delivering a
25 year contract with the Ministry of Defence. Delta
Water Services, a wholly owned subsidiary of KWS,
provides sub contracted operational and maintenance
services to over 80% of Brey’s sites. KWS is also 
a 45% shareholder in Aberdeen Environmental
Services which manages four waste water plants in
Aberdeenshire under a 25 year contract. Grampian
Waste Water Services, a wholly owned subsidiary of
KWS, operates the contract.
“The past 12 months have seen
significant growth at Kelda
Water Services which is
earning an enviable reputation
in the marketplace.”

9 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Our International businesses’ results 
have shown continued strong growth with 
customer numbers up 19% to 2.6m and 
profits
1
 from our established International 
businesses, in the USA, France and Spain, 
20% higher at £34m (including the benefit  
of owning 100% of Doméo for the full 
reporting period).
The reduction in UK customer numbers and 
earnings has more than offset the strong 
growth in our International businesses with 
adjusted profit before tax
2
 for the Group 
reducing from £126.0m to £105.0m.
The table below shows our performance 
metrics on a global basis as at 31 March 2013:
We have reinforced a customer focused 
culture across all our operations. In particular, 
in the UK, customer satisfaction has 
increased and the number of complaints  
has reduced by 40%. We are also improving 
our cost efficiency by reducing complexity, 
sharing best practice and investing in 
new systems and technology. In the UK, 
for example, we have focused our affinity 
partnerships on utilities, manufacturers of 
installed appliances and financial services 
companies and we announced in March that 
we are going to invest in a new packaged IT 
system which will be implemented across the 
entire Group.

UK
UK revenue reduced by £45m to £309m 
(2012: £354m) reflecting the reduction 
in customer numbers and related repair 
income. Adjusted operating profit
1
 in the UK 
was £78m (2012: £103m) with the reduction 
in revenue being partially offset by lower 
costs. The lower costs are a result of a 
reduced headcount and lower marketing 
expenditure, partially offset by increased 
governance and control costs. UK statutory 
operating profit was £68m (2012: £78m) 
including exceptional expenditure of £10m, of 
which £6m is our estimate for the costs and 
fine arising from the FCA investigation, and 
the remaining £4m relates to the reduction of 
around 300 roles announced in March 2013. 
Customer numbers in the UK have fallen to 
2.3m, in line with our expectations (2012: 
2.7m). The reduction is a result of the low 
level of marketing activity in FY2013, which 
was insufficient to replace those customers 
that did not renew in the ordinary course. As 
we increase our marketing activity we expect 
the number of new customers acquired to at 
least equal the number not renewing, which 
should enable us to stabilise the UK customer 
base at around 1.9m customers from  
March 2014. 
Our UK gross new policy sales, and customer 
and policy numbers have all reduced during 
the year as a result of lower marketing activity 
whilst we focused on the development 
and testing of new marketing materials, 
sales channel enhancements, new product 
development, the restructuring of our call 
centre operations and the implementation 
of improved governance and controls. Gross 
new customers in FY2013 were 0.1m (2012: 
0.3m) and gross new policy sales were 0.2m 
(2012: 0.7m). Total policies at the end of 
March 2013 were 5.5m, a reduction of 18% 
on the prior year (2012: 6.7m), similar to the 
reduction in customer numbers. 
Income per customer increased to £106 
(2012: £99), reflecting the benefit from price 
rises and the mix of policies.
The policy retention rate increased from 78% 
in the first half of the year to 79% for the full 
year (2012: 80%) and was above 80% in 
the final quarter. The increase in the second 
half of the year is a result of the high levels of 
customer satisfaction across all our touch 
points and the implementation of a number 
of ongoing retention initiatives as well as a 
reduction in the number of first year policies, 
which have a lower retention rate.
During the year, our network of 289 directly 
employed engineers and over 450 sub-
contractors completed 0.7m repairs. 
80% of our plumbing and drains repairs 
were completed by our directly employed 
engineers, who typically received the highest 
levels of customer satisfaction. 
 12 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
Our affinity partners continue to remain 
supportive of our plans and actions and we 
are pleased to confirm that two of our larger 
water utilities have signed new long-term 
agreements. 
During the second half of FY2013, the 
UK business saw improvements in the 
effectiveness of its sales and marketing 
activity. We are now planning to significantly 
increase the scale of our marketing activity 
in FY2014 as we aim to double the number of 
new customers to around 0.2m, up from 0.1m 
in FY2013, but compared to 0.6m in FY2011. 
Direct mail marketing activity is expected 
to more than double in FY2014 and we are 
also planning to increase sales through 
our partner call centres and continue the 
development of our internet and digital 
sales channels. We have, during FY2013, 
recommenced policy sales through our 
partner call centres and during FY2014 we 
expect to increase the number of partners 
who operate this sales channel and to build 
on the call conversion rates achieved during 
the final quarter of FY2013.
We are increasing our investment in internet 
and digital channels. We have already 
recruited and have in place a new team who 
have significant experience and expertise in 
internet and digital marketing activity. During 
FY2014, we will be refocusing our internet 
site on customer acquisition, improving our 
search engine optimisation and enhancing 
the HomeServe pages within our affinity 
partners’ websites. We will continue to use 
the outbound telephony channel primarily for 
selling to existing customers. 
The planned increase in new customer 
acquisition volumes and retention will also be 
supported by the roll-out of new products, 
including an improved Plumbing and 
Drainage product, which includes cover for 
non-emergency items such as dripping taps 
and leaking overflows. 
As customer numbers have reduced in 
the UK we have taken action to reduce our 
operating costs and improve our operating 
efficiency. The average number of UK 
employees has reduced by 377 over the past 
year and we announced a further reduction 
of 300 roles in March 2013 reflecting the 
expected reduction in customer numbers 
from 3m in September 2011 to around 1.9m 
by March 2014. We have also started a 
number of process re-engineering projects 
to simplify processes to further improve the 
customer experience and improve efficiency.
In November 2011, we commenced a number 
of business improvement initiatives, which 
were consistent with the feedback received 
from our Supervisory team at the FCA. 
These initiatives focused on our sales and 
marketing, controls and governance and 
complaints handling issues. Our customer re-
contact exercise is the only initiative still to be 
completed and this is progressing as planned.
We are now close to completing the review 
of the complaints that were received during 
winter 2010 and we are also making progress 
in contacting customers who may have 
suffered detriment as a result of the way 
in which they were sold their policy. This 
exercise is expected to be completed by 
March 2014.
The FCA investigation into our past issues in 
the UK business is ongoing and is expected to 
take a number of months to complete.

millionth US policy on 20 March 2013.  
To celebrate this significant milestone, 
he will receive 10 years of free 
HomeServe coverage for the exterior 
water and sewer lines at his home.
USA
Revenue in the USA was £101m (2012: £82m), 
22% higher than a year ago driven by a 25% 
increase in customer numbers. Adjusted 
operating profit
1
 was £9.5m (2012: £9.0m).
We are a national business, licensed to 
operate in all 50 USA states, and we now work 
with 35 partners in the USA and Canada. 
Over the past year we have signed ten new 
utility affinity partnerships in ten states with a 
mix of gas, electric and water utilities across 
both public and municipality ownership. 
The new partnerships include a long-term 
marketing agreement with Montana 
Dakota Utilities (MDU), which serves 260k 
households in the states of North and 
South Dakota, Montana and Wyoming. This 
agreement was part of the acquisition of 
MDU’s policy book, which was completed in 
March 2013. MDU’s 52k home assistance 
policies, which provided protection for a 
property’s primary heating appliance and 
water heater across 26k customers, have 
now transferred to HomeServe. 
Gross new policy sales (excluding acquired 
policies) during the year were 0.7m (2012: 
0.6m). This growth, together with a good 
retention performance, has resulted in 
customer numbers increasing by 25% to 
1.3m (2012: 1.1m) and policy numbers also 
increasing by 25% to 2.1m (2012: 1.7m). 
We are making good progress in broadening 
the range of sales channels used in North 
America. Direct mail remains the main 
channel for new customer acquisition 
although during the year we have significantly 
increased the number of partners who  
either use their call centres to sell our  
policies or transfer potential sales calls to 
our agents. We have also commenced online 
policy sales via our HomeServe USA website. 
We expect to increase sales through our 
partners’ call centres in the future as well as 
significantly grow sales via our USA internet 
and digital channels.
Over the past 12 months we have more than 
doubled the number of marketing mailings 
as a result of the increase in the number 
of affinity partners and our own brand 
marketing activity. Despite the significant 
growth in direct mail activity, our response 
rates and payback periods have continued to 
be attractive and in line with our expectations.
Raising the awareness of homeowners’ 
responsibilities for the pipes and wires in and 
around their home is key to the continued 
strong growth in customer numbers. We were 
therefore pleased to announce in February 
2013 an association with Giuliani Partners 
and former New York City Mayor, Rudy 
Giuliani. Giuliani Partners and Mayor Giuliani 
will advise us on increasing awareness of 
the need for water and sewer infrastructure 
investment and consumer protection across 
the USA.

The USA retention rate has increased to 
80% (2012: 79%). In the USA, we continue 
to achieve retention rates of around 90% 
where we bill the customer via their utility bill 
and therefore we are planning to increase the 
number of partners who use ‘on bill’ payment 
collection for our products in FY2014. A key 
benefit from the system improvements being 
planned across the Group will be the ability to 
more quickly integrate our billing processes 
with those of utilities in the future.
There remain significant opportunities 
for growth in North America and we are 
therefore continuing to invest in people and 
infrastructure as well as additional marketing 
activity. Over the past year, we have 
strengthened our business development 
team, increased our IT and digital expertise 
as well as enhanced our senior management 
team with a number of new positions. 
As we grow the number of customers and 
policies, we also need to ensure we maintain 
and improve our operational efficiency and 
have, for example, outsourced the processing 
of postal policy applications to a specialist 
and have recently announced the closure 
of our Miami administration centre. The 
work currently undertaken in Miami will be 
transferred to our other USA locations, in 
Stamford and Chattanooga, and a third party 
specialist outsourcer. 
Our 134 directly employed technicians  
and network of around 700 high quality 
 sub-contractors completed 0.27m jobs 
during FY2013.

Doméo
In its first full year of 100% HomeServe 
ownership, Doméo contributed revenue of 
£74m in FY2013 compared to £52m in the 
previous year (when it was 49% owned by 
HomeServe for the first 8 months of the year 
and 100% for the final 4 months). Adjusted 
operating profit
1
 was £22m (2012: £17m). 
On a like-for-like basis, revenues increased 
by 1% and adjusted operating profit
1
 by 
8% reflecting good cost control and less 
outbound marketing activity. 
French customers continue to remain very 
loyal, with the policy retention rate increasing 
to 89% (2012: 88%). This high rate reflects 
the proportion of customers using a monthly 
continuous payment method to pay for their 
policy, a consistently high level of customer 
satisfaction and a low level of customer 
complaints.
Doméo achieved gross new policy sales 
of 0.3m (2012: 0.4m) with total customer 
numbers increasing by 2% to 0.91m (2012: 
0.89m) during the year. Policy numbers grew 
0.01m to 2.34m (2012: 2.33m). 
Income per customer increased by 2% to 
€98 (2012: €96), reflecting the mix and price 
of policies held by customers.
The majority of our new customers in France 
are acquired through direct mail marketing. 
We are however developing new sales 
channels in Doméo to enable us to increase 
customer growth in the future. Over the past 
year we have increased the proportion of 
sales generated through Veolia’s call centres 
as a result of improving the call conversion 
rate as well as increasing the number of 
Veolia call centres transferring calls to our 
sales teams. 
During the second half of FY2013, we 
developed and tested new plumbing 
emergency and drainage products in France 
with favourable customer feedback. We are 
therefore planning to focus our new customer 
acquisition campaigns on these products 
in FY2014. We are also developing a revised 
water loss product in France, which will be 
principally used in cross-sell activity. 
Acquiring 100% control of Doméo in 
December 2011 has given us an opportunity 
to broaden our range of affinity partners in 
France and we have reorganised the business 
to increase the focus and resource allocated 
to new partner development. We have, over 
the past year, started early stage discussions 
with a number of energy and water utilities.
All of our repairs in France are managed 
through our network of 950 sub-contractors 
who completed a similar number of repairs 
compared to the previous year.

Spain
In Spain, revenue was £61m (2012: £60m) 
and adjusted operating profit
1
 was £3.1m 
(2012: £2.8m). The growth in adjusted 
operating profit
1
 reflects the increase in 
customer and policy numbers and the benefit 
of higher claims handling volumes and 
margins, partially offset by increased sales 
and marketing activity in the membership 
business.
Customer and policy numbers continue  
to show strong growth. Customer numbers 
increased by 50% to 0.4m (2012: 0.3m)  
and policy numbers were up 43% to 0.5m 
(2012: 0.3m).
Gross new policy sales were 0.3m, up 
from 0.2m in FY2012, as we increased our 
marketing activity with both our affinity 
partners; Endesa and Agbar. 
During FY2013, we continued to increase 
the proportion of sales generated through 
our partners’ call centres and the outbound 
telephony channel. Sales through our 
partners’ call centres accounted for 56% of 
gross new policy sales (2012: 14%). 
Sales of our Electrical Assistance policy by 
Endesa’s call centre agents have proven 
very successful over the past 12 months. 
Over 68% of new customers in FY2013 were 
acquired through this sales channel and 
we expect this to increase in FY2014. Our 
Electrical Assistance product covers the cost 
of the call out for any electrical emergency 
and two hours of labour together with two 
electrical handyman services per annum, 
each of two hours. The product, which is 
offered at a 50% discount in the first year, 
is sold by Endesa to customers when they 
switch their electricity tariff and is billed via 
the utility bill.
Our claims handling business in Spain 
continues to perform well with continued 
growth in the number of claims managed and 
a higher margin. Our network of 2,100 sub-
contractors and the 147 Reparalia franchised 
engineers completed 0.5m repairs over the 
past twelve months. 
New Markets 
  Long-term agreement with Enel Energia

Our New Markets segment includes our

as well as Société Française de Garantie 
(SFG), our French warranty business.
The New Markets businesses reported 
revenue of £9.4m, lower than the £11.6m in 
the prior year, primarily as a result of the sale 
of our Belgian businesses in March 2012. 
The increased adjusted operating loss
1
 of 
£4.8m (2012: £3.4m) reflects the additional 
investment in Italy and Germany over the 
past 12 months as well as lower earnings  
from SFG.
As the Spanish policy base is still relatively small and growing quickly we do not currently report the retention rate and income per customer metrics.
 Chief Executive’s review
20 Annual Report & Accounts 2013
In Italy, we have signed a long-term 
agreement with the energy utility Enel 
Energia, enabling us to market to 3.5m 
households and have recently completed 
the systems development to enable us to bill 
Italian customers on their utility bill. During 
FY2014, we will be significantly increasing our 
marketing activity to Enel Energia customers 
and our Italian water utility partner Veritas, 
as well as targeting the development of other 
affinity partnerships.
In Germany, we completed a test marketing 
campaign with BS Energy (part of the Veolia 
group) and will be focusing on developing 
additional affinity partnerships in FY2014. 
Earnings from our SFG retail warranty 
business have been impacted by the 
reduction in retail sales of electrical goods in 
France together with the full year impact of 
the loss of one of our larger retailers following 
a take-over by a retailer who manages 
warranties in-house. 
Outlook
Our business model continues to deliver 
value for customers, affinity partners 
and shareholders, and remains very cash 
generative. We expert to stabilise our UK 
customer numbers at around 1.9m by  
31 March 2014, and are confident that we 
can continue to grow our International 
businesses, enabling the Group overall to 
return to modest growth from FY2015.
UK
In FY2014 we are planning to recruit around 
0.2m new customers in the UK, double the 
number recruited in FY2013, as we develop 
and increase the scale of our marketing 
activity. By FY2015 we are planning to 
recruit around 0.3m new customers a year 
enabling us to stabilise the UK customer 
base at around 1.9m customers. The planned 
increase in new customer acquisition 
volumes will be supported by the roll-out of 
new products as well as more support from 
our water affinity partners, with an increasing 
proportion of sales coming from their call 
centres, and the development of our internet 
and digital sales channels. 
We continue to expect the full year UK 
underlying retention rate (excluding losses 
from the run-off of non-core manufacturer 
warranties and customer re-contact exercise) 
to increase to around 80% in FY2014 and 
would expect it to increase further in future 
years as we benefit from the roll-out of 
new products and increasing customer 
satisfaction.
In FY2014, the reduction in the number of 
customers renewing will result in around 
£35m of lower contribution (compared to 
FY2013), which is expected to be partially 
offset by headcount savings of around £10m.
UK revenue in FY2015 is expected to reduce 
further by around £20m (compared to 
FY2014) as a result of a lower number of 
renewing customers and the continued 
marketing and roll-out of new enhanced 
products. 
This reduction will be partially offset by 
full year savings in direct costs and further 
operating efficiencies.

In our International businesses we are 
confident that we will continue to deliver 
strong and sustainable growth in customers

Our USA business provides our most 
significant growth opportunity and in FY2014 
we expect it to significantly benefit from 
the 25% increase in customer numbers in 
FY2013 and to continue to deliver a high 
customer growth rate in the future. In France, 
we expect customer numbers to increase 
although the rate of customer and profit 
growth is likely to be modest until we sign 
another major utility affinity partner. In 
Spain, we are planning for continued strong 
growth in customer and policy numbers in 
our membership business as we continue 
to invest in our marketing activity and grow 
our renewal revenue. As our businesses in 
Italy and Germany invest in growing their 
customer numbers we expect our New 
Markets segment to report an operating loss 
of around £6m per annum.
System developments
To support our growth plans and improve 
our operational efficiency, we are investing 
in a new packaged IT system which will be 
implemented across the entire Group. This 
investment, amounting to around £30m over 
the next three years (FY2014 - FY2016), will 
start to deliver operational benefits in FY2015 
with financial benefits starting to accrue from 
FY2016.
In the UK, the new system will improve our 
marketing effectiveness, reduce our costs 
and improve our compliance and control 
processes. In our US business, it will enable 
us to on-board affinity partners and integrate 
our charging processes into their billing 
systems more quickly. Across the Group,  
the system will provide call centre agents in 
all parts of the business with a single view of 
the customer. 
Summary
The financial impact of the reduction in 
UK customer numbers has unfortunately 
more than offset the strong growth in our 
International businesses in FY2013. We are 
however implementing plans to stabilise UK 
customer numbers at around 1.9m by the 
end of March 2014, which will then enable 
customer numbers across the Group to 
grow again. UK earnings are expected to 
be negatively impacted in both FY2014 and 
FY2015, but we expect the growth in our 
International business to enable the Group 
overall to return to modest growth in FY2015.
We are confident that we can stabilise 
UK customer numbers as well as grow 
our established overseas businesses. We 
are therefore continuing to invest in the 
development of our new businesses in Italy 
and Germany as well as implementing a new 
group-wide IT system.
Our products and services continue to meet 
clear customer needs and we are confident 
that our business model can continue to 
deliver long-term value for all stakeholders.

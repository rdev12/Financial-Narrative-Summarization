Inchcape plc ¦ Annual Report and Accounts 2009 10
Inchcape is uniquely positioned
worldwide.We are a leading
independent international automotive
distributor and retailer who has
delivered a record cash performance
in the downturn by creating great value
from great brands.We are strongly
positioned for the global recovery.
Inchcape is a leading independent,
international automotive distributor and
retailer,with scale operations in Australia,
Belgium,Greece,Hong Kong,Russia,
Singapore and the UK as well as operations
in 19 other markets.We represent some of
the world’s leading automotive brands with
whom we have long-standing relationships.
The Inchcape management team has
reacted decisively to the unprecedented
global slowdown in car sales witnessed in
the latter part of 2008 and in early 2009 by
focusing on ﬁve key operational priorities:
to build market share; to grow our aftersales
business; to reduce our costs; to manage
our working capital by controlling inventory;
and to limit capital expenditure to
committed strategic investments.
These actions,together with our decision
to strengthen our capital structure and
reduce debt through a Rights Issue
completed in April 2009 with the support of
our shareholders,has meant the Group has
ended 2009 in a signiﬁcantly stronger
position than we entered it.
Inchcape is in a net cash position,has
gained share in many of its key markets,has
enjoyed a resilient aftersales performance
(approximately 50% of Group gross margin)
and has signiﬁcantly reduced the cost of
doing business.Our operating cash ﬂow
was the highest achieved since 2000 and
was almost twice our operating proﬁt
(before exceptional items) as we reduced
our stock.Further,we have strengthened our
balance sheet which will enable the Group
to trade effectively,invest in working capital
and to take advantage of the upturn.
During the Company’s 160 plus year history,
Inchcape has invariably emerged from a
time of crisis stronger and more resilient.
Although we expect a continuation of
difﬁcult trading conditions in many of our
markets until well into the second half of
2010,I am conﬁdent that we are uniquely
positioned as the global industry leader to
grasp the opportunities of recovery when
they emerge.
In that context,I would like to emphasise
why we believe that the medium to long
term outlook for Inchcape is very exciting.

Resilient business model
We operate scale retail and distribution
businesses in 26 markets across the world
and are a leader in 14 of these.Our core
brand partners,with whom we have long-
standing relationships,have a history of
outperforming the market.Inchcape’s global
scale of operation is unique in our industry.
Our business model is further strengthened
by the Group’s broad geographic spread,
which embraces developed markets (like
Australia,the UK and other western European
countries together with powerful Asian
centres like Hong Kong and Singapore),
and emerging markets (such as Russia,
China and other central and eastern
European states) and is unequalled.Our
diversity has spread risk,as decline in some
markets has been balanced by strength
in others.It also gives us a vital presence
in those emerging markets where sales
potential is highest and which,in the fullness
of time,we believe will deliver the best
returns thanks to our efﬁcient retail footprint.
We also match the demands and
opportunities in each territory with the
appropriate channel strategy.
In small to medium sized markets,we
predominantly operate as country
distributors,where we become the
custodian of brands like Toyota,Lexus and
Subaru to manage every step of the journey
between the factory and the end customer.
This demands our deep involvement with
our brand partners,as well as developing
local brand,marketing and sales strategies,
ﬁnance products,aftersales servicing,parts
and accessories,plus managing sales via
a mix of Inchcape-owned retail centres
and third-party independent dealerships.
In larger markets like the UK and Russia,
manufacturers use their own national sales
companies to distribute and appoint
independent dealers.In these markets,we
operate a retail service that is increasingly
focused on bigger,better sites that deliver
an enhanced customer experience and
provide scale volume for our sales and
aftersales activities,including servicing,
parts and accessories.
In the city state markets of Hong Kong
and Singapore and a number of central
European states,we operate a‘vertically
integrated retail’(VIR) model where we
are both the distributor and the exclusive
retailer,enabling us to deliver heightened
efﬁciencies and strong margins through
our management of the entire value chain.
Inchcape has a mix of growth and
defensive value drivers,which gives the
Group a diversity of revenue streams.Our
growth drivers are new and used vehicle
sales together with associated ﬁnance
and insurance products,which are
particularly important to facilitate the sales
process.Defensive drivers are our resilient
parts and aftersales servicing businesses,
which in 2009 represented approximately
50% of our Group gross margin.
We are in close partnership with many
of the best known and most respected
automotive brands in the world.These are
strong,innovative brands that outperform
and lead the market based on years of
investment,to create deep customer
relationships through constant technological
advance and continuous improvement.

Unique approach:
Inchcape Advantage is our
competitive advantage
To extract the greatest value from this unique
global infrastructure,we have a clear and
simple vision,to be‘the world’s most
customer-centric automotive retail group’.
Our industry is generally not known for the
quality of its customer service and our
approach is based on a simple insight: if we
look after people and their cars better than
the competition,customers are more likely to
choose us; and if we perform demonstrably
better for our brand partners than our
competitors,manufacturers are more likely
to expand their global business with us.
By successfully continuing to implement
our strategy for improved customer service,
based on our unique Inchcape Advantage
programme,we increased market share in
many of our markets in 2009,despite tough
decision-making that led to the closure of
underperforming sites and a reduction
in headcount.
Through Inchcape Advantage,customer
service is truly at the heart of the business,
from the top of the company to the sales
ﬂoor and service workshop.It is intrinsic to
the way that every Inchcape person works,
ensuring that providing superior service is
present and evident at every stage of the
customer journey.
As a result,we believe we are the most
advanced company in our industry in
implementing cutting edge retail techniques
and technologies.Among other initiatives
we manage a continuous mystery shopper
programme to maintain the highest
standards of in-centre service; we interview
around 12,000 customers every month to
identify precisely what we do well and what
we should do better; and we constantly
track a wide range of customer metrics –
from footfall and test drives to leads and
conversion rates.
Our global online portal (winner of a
Microsoft Innovation Award) is used to
interrogate this data,enabling local
performance management and the
sharing of information across the Group to
learn on a daily basis from the experience
of our businesses across the world.These
leading indicators and a real time view
of our customers provide us with valuable
insights into changing consumer
preferences and behaviours,effectively
accelerating our response and enabling us
to grasp new opportunities as they emerge.
These proprietary retail processes are
truly unique in the automotive sector.They
are a vital point of differentiation across
our business and the foundation stone of
the operational excellence that gives us
a key advantage as we expand into
emerging markets.
Unique
approach
Through our superior
customer processes,
we deliver the
ultimate customer
experience and
create maximum
value for our brand
partners across the

Inchcape Advantage is a systematic,Group wide
continuous improvement programme that is at
the heart of our strategic commitment to
strengthening our business through customer-
centric operational excellence.
The outstanding quality of service it drives is
proven to set us apart from our competitors,
building tangible customer loyalty that makes
potential buyers more likely to deal with us
than with anybody else.
In an industry not renowned for putting the
customer ﬁrst,Inchcape Advantage is our
competitive advantage.
We are convinced that the real
differentiator is,increasingly,the
customer experience.Superior
customer service is a sustainable
competitive advantage for us through
our metrics and proprietary Inchcape

consistently through all of our retail
centres across the globe.

Decentralised and empowered
organisation
I believe that this unique position also
extends to the quality of our global and
regional management teams,on whose
personal judgement and freedom to make
decisions so much depends.
It is our people across the world who
have enabled us to deliver a performance
in 2009 that was ahead of our own
expectations and which improved as the
year progressed.Revenues declined year
on year but due to our committed
operational focus,we ended 2009 with
a robust gross margin performance,strong
cash ﬂows,improved customer service
globally and increased market share
in many territories across the world.
This performance was due,in no small part,
to the tight management of our ﬁve key
priorities – growing market share,growing
aftersales,reducing costs,managing
working capital,and selective capital
expenditure investment – augmented by
the in depth personal knowledge that our
local management teams have of their
markets.Our decentralised structure
enables management to act swiftly with
relevant,local,innovative propositions to
meet the particular needs and preferences
of their customer base,ensuring that a
localised customer focus builds on our
global strategy.
High quality people are vital to ensure that
the business model works,and I would like
to thank all our employees for playing a
fundamental role in delivering a record
operating cash ﬂow in 2009.

Growing
aftersales
Despite the
downturn,our

customer service,
effective marketing
campaigns and our
approach to
customer retention.
Reducing
costs
We reduced like for

at constant
currency during
2009,having taken
the difﬁcult decision
to close 31 less
proﬁtable sites
and reduce our
workforce by
2,350 people.
Managing
working
capital
In reducing our
inventory by 28.7%
in comparison with
the end of 2008,
we were able to
destock faster than
we expected and
release cash from
working capital.
Controlling

activities have been
selective and have
focused on the
opening of nine

Outperforming the downturn – our Five Key Priorities
The decline in new car sales that we saw
begin in late 2008 was unprecedented.We
immediately narrowed our management
focus across the world to five key priorities.
The speed and decisiveness with which
we responded was the result of the many
years collective industry experience and
a deep personal understanding shared by
our local managers of what really matters
in their markets.
As a result of actions taken at the end of
2008 and during 2009,we ended the year
in a far stronger competitive and financial
position than we entered it.

Uniquely positioned for the future
I believe that the future for Inchcape,its
employees,brand partners and
shareholders is very exciting.
While we remain cautious about the timing
of the market recovery,we certainly believe
that no competitor is better placed than
Inchcape,both to weather any continuing
impact of the downturn and to grasp
the opportunities that recovery will bring.
We consider Inchcape to be uniquely
positioned worldwide to take advantage of
the global upturn for a number of reasons.
We are one of the most international of FTSE
350 listed retailers,having delivered 83% of
trading proﬁt outside of the UK in the last six
years.Our diversiﬁed geographic portfolio
has scale businesses in 26 developed and
emerging markets and we are a leader in
14 of these.
Our resilient business model,with distribution
and retail channels,differentiating Customer
1st strategy and empowered management
has a proven track record.
Our portfolio of the world’s strongest
automotive brands consistently outperforms
the industry.
Our balance of revenue streams provides us
with both growth opportunities and recurring
aftermarket income.
Our leading,customer-centric operational
processes introduced with our Inchcape
Advantage programme,have improved our
competitive position globally.
Our competitive position has grown
stronger over the last year,both in terms
of customer service and market share,
providing us with an excellent growth
platform for the future.
We expect customer demand for greener
technology to drive vehicle replacement in
developed markets and we are partnered
with manufacturers committed to investing
in the newest technology and greener
vehicles.In the emerging markets,where
we have scale operations and the car
ownership levels are relatively low,the
increase in wealth will grow demand.
We believe consolidation of a fragmented
market to be inevitable.Inchcape will
beneﬁt from increased market share and
the desire of manufacturers to seek new
retail or distribution partners with the
strongest companies.We have the ﬁnancial
ﬁrepower to invest in the best strategic
opportunities to give us and our brand
partners access to markets with strong
future wealth and growth potential.
We outperformed the market in 2009.
I believe that we will continue to outperform
our competitors in 2010 and that Inchcape
is uniquely positioned worldwide to beneﬁt
from the global market recovery in 2011
and beyond.

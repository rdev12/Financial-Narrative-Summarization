Our year at a glance
Chairman’s statement
In a year during which we actively broadened our trading strategy, 
we have made strong progress in growing our customer base 
and revenues in both our consumer and B2B businesses. 
As a result we reported revenue growth of over 4%* and saw 
an improvement in profitability which allowed us to grow the 
dividend by the 15% to which we committed. I am pleased to 
report, therefore, that for FY15 the Board has declared a final 
dividend of 9.2p that, in addition to our interim dividend of 
4.6p, gives a total pay-out for the year of 13.8p.
These are significant achievements that highlight the 
sustainable power of leveraging our network to deliver value 
for money products to consumers and businesses across 
the UK, while also creating value for shareholders. We are 
excited about the potential for the business to continue 
saving customers money and at the same time, growing 
against the background of a rapidly changing sector. It has 
been another year of significant change and challenge for 
our employees, and the Board and I would like to thank them 
for their efforts and for their continuing commitment to 
TalkTalk and to our customers.
* Statutory revenue after £5m exceptional VAT adjustment in FY14.
Sir Charles Dunstone
Chairman
We have delivered on our revenue growth 
guidance as planned, and have exited 
the year with our strongest ever quarterly 
revenue growth of 6%, and our lowest 
ever level of churn. British consumers 
and businesses increasingly appreciate 
TalkTalk’s value for money products, 
and we are focused on improving our 
customers’ experience still further and 
growing our already flourishing quad 
play business.“

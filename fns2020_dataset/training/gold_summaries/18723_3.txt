When Kevin Hollinrake and John Waterhouse 
established Hunters in 1992, their vision was to 
develop the brand to become the largest estate 
agency group in the UK. 24 years later, they and 
their founding vision remain active within the 
Company and instrumental to its success.
Hunters grew organically, offering sales and 
lettings through 10 owned branches. 2005 
saw the beginning of a new phase with the 
development of its franchising expansion which, 
together with strategic acquisition, has seen the 
network grow to its current size. 
The services offered cover residential sales; 
lettings; buy-to-let and investment; residential 
block management; land and new homes; 
franchising and other property related services. 
Hunters has won more than 30 awards; 
maintained Investor in People certification for 
more than a decade; twice been voted Best UK 
Estate Agent by the Home Sale Network (now 
the Relocation Agent Network) and featured in 
the Sunday Times Best 100 Companies. STRATEGIC REPORT OVERVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OVERVIEW
Following our admission to the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange in July 
2015, we are delighted to report our maiden full-year results as a public company. 
2015 saw a step forward in pursuit of the Group’s 
clear ambition to become the nation’s favourite 
estate agent. We secured additional capital, 
added 32 new branches to the network including 
23 independent businesses and added another 
23 branches through the purchase of a highly 
successful home-counties franchised estate agency 
chain, Country Properties. At the end of the year 
the network had reached 170 branches. Having 
opened 63 branches in the last two years through 
organic growth, we are without doubt the fastest 
growing listed business in our sector.
Income across the network from sales and lettings 
("Network Income") reached £30.2 million in 
2015 (2014: £21.2 million), a 42% increase on the 
previous year. Our average branch revenue rose 
by 5.6% to £178,000 (2014: £168,000). This was a 
tremendous achievement against the background 
of a more subdued market with national activity 
reported as having reduced by 3.4% for the year
1
.
Our adjusted EBITDA reached £1.57 million  
(2014: £1.08 million), an increase of 46% on the 
previous year. Adjusted EPS grew 31% to 4.74p 
(2014: 3.63p).
Independent agents that converted to the Hunters 
brand, for whom 2015 was their first full year 
as part of the network, increased revenue per 
branch by 29%; a clear illustration that our quality, 
well known national brand and good reputation 
has delivered improved income for our network 
partners, as well as significantly reducing the 
cost of key repeat purchases, such as portal 
subscriptions, through our economies of scale  
and purchasing power. 
We continue to invest in our people, IT, marketing 
and networks. We retain Investors in People 
status for our Group owned activities and our 
national training courses include accreditations 
from The Institute of Leadership and Management 
and City & Guilds. Our market-leading software, 
designed specifically for our business by an in-
house team of former agents, continues to move 
forward. We have invested over £500,000 in its 
development and we are able now to reinvest 
profits generated from licence fees payable by the 
network to accelerate and enhance its features 
and improve our online functionality and customer 
experience. The inaugural launch of our national 
TV advertising campaign took place in January 
2015. Website traffic for 2015 rose by over 23%.

The 'Here to get you there’ marketing campaign 
has proved successful and will continue to be our 
message in the year ahead.
The Hunters (West Midlands) business acquired 
in 2014 continues to exceed our expectations, 
winning Best Medium-Sized Agent in the Midlands 
for the fourth year in a row. Business levels and 
financial results are in line with expectations.
Customer satisfaction will always be a key measure 
and I am delighted to confirm that we achieved a 
96% customer satisfaction rating for the year.  
Our success in the area has been increasing year-
on-year since 2012 and is significantly higher than 
the industry average of 73%
2
. There is a universal 
commitment within the network to deliver for 
our customers, which underpins our belief that 
business owners will work harder and deliver 
better results than a network consisting principally 
of employees or self-employed operatives on 
short term contracts. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to thank everyone in the network 
who has worked so hard to deliver these amazing 
results, and our customer service team for going 
well beyond the call of duty to contact our clients 
and listen to their experiences. 
OUTLOOK
Reports show that market activity levels so far 
this year are 14.1% higher compared to the same 
period last year
3
. The first quarter has started 
well, with seven new branches opened, revenue 
ahead of Q1 2015 and having grown by more 
than general market activity. Our pipeline of new 
outlets is running significantly ahead of 2015. I look 
forward to updating you as the year progresses.
The Company is committed to 
a progressive dividend policy 
and proposes therefore a final 
dividend of 1.00p per share, 
making 1.50p for 2015 in total.

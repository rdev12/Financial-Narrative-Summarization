Solid Waste is the collection, transfer, recycling and treatment of 
non-hazardous waste. The market can be divided into Industrial 
and Commercial (I&C), Construction and Demolition (C&D) and 
Municipal. I&C represents general commercial waste where 
contracts are generally short term. The C&D market is more 
cyclical in nature and is also typiﬁed by shorter term contracts. 
Municipal represents short or medium-term contracts for the 
collection and treatment of household waste. Many elements 
of the waste can be recycled and re-used.
The Organics market includes source segregated streams 
from both the industrial and municipal sectors with both shorter 
term and longer term contracts. Through specialist processing, 
biogas is produced from the natural biological activity. 
The biogas is then used to produce electricity which is then 
transferred directly into the local grid. We also use composting 
techniques to produce a quality pathogen free soil enhancer 
or fertiliser. Organic processing is one of the fastest growing 
segments within the waste sector.
The Hazardous Waste market focuses on the processing 
and ﬁnal disposal of lightly contaminated materials 
including the thermal treatment of soils, the biological 
and physio-chemical treatment of waste water and the 
pyrolysis of paint waste. We also supply industrial cleaning 
services to the oil and gas and petrochemical industries.
The UK Municipal market represents the provision of waste 
disposal services to local authorities in the UK. We treat it 
separately from the rest of the municipal markets referred 
to in the solid waste section above because of the nature 
of the contracts. They are 25 year Private Finance Initiative (PFI) 
or Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangements where we 
have an operating contract to treat the municipal waste delivered 
to the recycling facilities. This market is driven by the need to 
reduce substantially the amount of UK waste going to landﬁll 
as set out in the EU Landﬁll Directive.

 Annual Report & Accounts 2012 Revenue from products and services
What we do Our strategy
•  Leading supplier of drug 
delivery devices to the global 
pharmaceutical industry, with  
a market leading share in devices 
for respiratory therapies
•  Leading US supplier of disposable 
medical products used by 
anaesthetists in the establishment 
and maintenance of patient 
airways
•  Global reputation for innovation, 
design for manufacture and high 
quality volume manufacture in 
regulated markets
•  Diversiﬁcation strategy into 
new drug delivery and airway 
visualisation devices broadening 
market opportunities for growth
We have invested in increased R&D 
resources and have a growing portfolio of 
signiﬁcant new products due for launch in 
both divisions over the next ﬁve years.
New product 
development
We are diversifying the Bespak division  
into adjacent areas of drug delivery and 
diagnostics to open up new and high  
growth market opportunities. We are 
expanding the King Systems division  
into international markets where it was 
previously not represented.
Increased 
market reach
We look to increase the value add offered  
to our customers. In the Bespak division this 
would include drug handling, for example. In 
King Systems this includes the development  
of more sophisticated higher value products 
such as the King Vision laryngoscope.

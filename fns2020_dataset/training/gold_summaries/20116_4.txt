Our history
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements
Xaar plc • Annual Report and Accounts 2014 • 1 Annual Report and Accounts 2014 • Xaar plc Leading the digital inkjet revolution
Industrial 
The Industrial sector presently includes 
ceramic tile decoration, decorative laminate, 
and advanced/additive manufacturing 
processes.
Market sectors 
Ceramic tile production
Ceramics is a 10.5 billion m² market currently 
and digital conversion was estimated to 
be over 50% at the end of 2014. There 
are c.10,000 production lines around the 
world, with almost half of these in China. 
The creative design is the key feature which 
sells a tile. Xaar’s digital inkjet solution 
provides an end result which is superior 
in	terms	of	image	quality ,	at	a	lower	cost,	
plus	with	the	advantages	of	flexibility ,	
inventory reduction, and larger tile size 
capability. Tile manufacturing operates in 
a harsh industrial environment with high 
r eliability/duty	cycle	r equir ements;	hence	
any technology deployed needs to be 
appropriately robust. The market has been 
moving to digital inkjet decoration over 
the last ten years with the pace of change 
accelerating after the launch of the Xaar 
1001 which achieved volume sales from 
2009 onwards. Today the Xaar 1002 family 
of printheads with TF Technology™ continue 
to	deliver	both	quality	and	cost	advantages	
over traditional analogue methods within 
a robust architecture suitable to this harsh 
environment, giving rise to maximum 
production uptime. 
Decorative laminates
Decorative laminates is estimated to be at 
7.9	billion	m²	of	annual	output	with	c.1,600	
production lines around the world supplying 
simulated wood materials to the furniture and 
building	industries.	Realistic	wood	finishes	
or creative design are the key features which 
sell	the	boar d/plank/finished	item	and	the	
digital	quality	that	is	now	being	demonstrated	
with Xaar printheads matches the analogue 
process, thereby offering the opportunity 
for more economic short run work to be 
undertaken whilst reducing inventories and 
improving time to market. Inkjet is the only 
digital solution which meets the high reliability 
and	high	duty	cycle	r equir ements	needed	
within this industry. 
Digital adoption is still at the very early stages 
in this application, and the rate of adoption is 
expected to grow over the next few years.
Advanced/additive manufacturing
Applications 	 include 	 demand 	 for 	 the 	 fine 	
coating, patterning and printing of functional 
fluids 	 onto 	 numer ous 	 substrates 	 in 	 numer ous 	
industries. Applications are challenging and 
push inkjet to its known limits and beyond 
in 	 fields 	 such 	 as 	 nano 	 imprinting, 	 solar 	 cell 	
manufacturing and display screen production. 
Xaar has been working with multiple partners 
in laboratories all over the world exploring 
what may be possible in the future. Technical 
progress is promising but the commercial 
implementation of many of these applications 
is still believed to be some years into the 
future.
Packaging
The Packaging sector presently includes 
primary labels, secondary labels, coding  
and marking, and Direct-to-Shape printing.
Market sectors 
Coding and marking 
Coding and marking is an application of 
printing predominantly monochrome bar 
codes and logos on outer case/secondary 
packaging of consumer goods. This is an 
established and stable business based on 
bulk piezo technology which competes with 
alternative technologies including laser and 
thermal inkjet.
Primary label 
Primary label printing is estimated to be a 
market producing over 55 billion m² annually, 
with only 9% of this market converted to 
digital printing to date. The change driver is 
the delivery of lower cost per copy on run 
lengths up to 100,000 impressions (versus 
only 50,000 impressions 3 years ago). There 
is a large range of substrates and inks in 
this application which adds complication to 
the conversion process. In 2014 the launch 
of	high	definition	mode	label	printers	using	
the Xaar 1002 delivered an observable step 
change	in	print	quality .
Direct-to-Shape 
Direct-to-Shape is a new application where 
bottles and containers have the image 
printed directly onto their surface without 
the need for a label. This emerging sector 
underwent	its	first	field	trials	during	2014.	
The solution is aimed at shortening time 
to market whilst simultaneously reducing 
inventory and unit costs versus existing 
methods. This approach also enables mass 
customised marketing and event targeting. 
Graphic Arts
The Graphic Arts sector presently includes 
Grand/Wide-format graphics.
Market sectors 
Grand/Wide-format graphics
Grand/Wide-format graphics (GWFG) 
includes both internal and external signage 
and advertising, including billboards, posters 
and point of sale advertising. It is the most 
mature industrial inkjet market, active for 
over 15 years. Xaar’s growth to date has 
been based on its original set of bulk piezo 
products, which delivered annual growth 
from 2003 to 2007. To stimulate further 
material growth for Xaar in this end market 
new	pr oduct	developments	ar e	r equir ed	to	
enhance the portfolio.

Xaar is a world leader in the development of inkjet technology 
and a manufacturer of piezoelectric drop-on-demand 
industrial inkjet printheads, the key component in a digital 
printing system. Unlike analogue printing, digital printing 
r equir es	no	physical	master	image	to	copy	fr om,	and	hence	
enables economic short run, variable data, printing. The 
printhead is the device which converts the electronic image 
data into the physical image on the substrate. To achieve this, 
Xaar technology is a combination of high speed mixed signal 
electr onics,	micr o-mechanics,	and	fluid	dynamics.	
Our	flagship	printhead	is	the	Xaar	1002,	but	our	full	range	includes	
numerous other printheads. A typical industrial inkjet machine could 
be	firing	up	to	300	million	dr ops	of	ink	per	second	–	that’ s	over	
1 trillion drops per hour, all controlled within the picolitre range of 
volume and the micron range of placement accuracy (a picolitre is a 
millionth of a millionth of a litre, and a micron is a millionth of a metre).
Xaar sells its technology in component form (the printhead) to 
Original	Equipment	Manufactur ers	(OEMs)	who	pr oduce	and	sell	the	
complete digital printing solution to the end market. In addition to  
our close engagement with OEMs we also actively partner and  
co-develop 	 with 	 fluid 	 suppliers, 	 har dwar e 	 and 	 softwar e 	 integrators, 	
and substrate suppliers to deliver a robust and attractive total solution 
to the end user. 
Our technology is used all over the world in a wide range of 
manufacturing applications.
We design and manufacture our printheads in the UK and Sweden, 
exporting over 95% of our production to customers around the 
world.	W e	also	develop	and	sell	ink	systems,	electr onics,	and	fluid	
optimisation services to accelerate inkjet system development  
and adoption.

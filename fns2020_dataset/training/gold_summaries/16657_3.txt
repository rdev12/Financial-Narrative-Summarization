OPERATING REVIEW
OUR BUSINESS
Trading profit increased significantly to £216.3 million, an increase of 11% at constant exchange rates and
28% at reported exchange rates. The increase in trading profit (at constant exchange rates) reflected a
contribution of £52.8 million from Foseco, more than offsetting underlying trading profit reductions in all
three divisions arising due to the fourth quarter market deterioration. Excluding Foseco, trading profit (at
constant exchange rates) for the Group was down by 16%, with Ceramics (excluding Foseco) down by 8%,
Electronics down by 22% and Precious Metals down by 59%.
The return on sales margin in 2008 decreased to 9.8% from 10.5% for 2007 (at reported exchange
rates), reflecting the fourth quarter deterioration. The impact of higher metal prices, which increased
reported revenue in the Electronics and Precious Metals divisions without any impact on profitability,
depressed the return on sales margin in 2008 by around 0.3 percentage points compared to last year.
Headline profit before tax increased by 18% and headline earnings per share were up 9% to 8.9 pence,
reflecting an 8% increase in the weighted average number of shares as a result of the October 2007 share
placing associated with the acquisition of Foseco. The headline earnings per share number reflects an
adjustment to reflect the impact of the rights issue completed subsequent to year-end on 4 March 2009.
Prior to the effect of this adjustment, headline earnings per share were 58.8 pence.
Following the acquisition of Foseco, net debt at 31 December 2008 increased to £732 million with a pro-
forma net debt to EBITDA ratio (as calculated for bank covenant purposes) of 2.6 times. On 4 March 2009,
the Group completed a successful rights issue which raised cash proceeds of £241 million, net of expenses.
Foseco
The acquisition of Foseco was completed on 4 April 2008 for around £620 million in cash and assumed
debt. The acquisition was financed by the combination of the net proceeds of £151 million from a share
placing on 11 October 2007 and a new bank facility. To satisfy the EU and US competition authorities’
requirements, Foseco’s Carbon Bonded Ceramics (“CBC”) business was sold to RHI AG on 16 April 2008 and
Cookson’s Hi-Tech ceramic filters business (“Hi-Tech”) was sold to Süd-Chemie AG on 23 December 2008.
The retained Foseco businesses are now managed within Cookson’s Ceramics division. Foseco’s “plc”
headquarters have been closed and the global integration process is proceeding well, with integration
benefits to be realised by 2010 now expected to be £24 million per annum (of which £10 million has been
realised in 2008), against a target of £18 million per annum at the time of announcing the acquisition.
The retained Foseco businesses traded strongly in the first ten months of 2008 (of which seven months
are included in Cookson’s results) and well ahead of our original expectations. However, their trading was
negatively impacted by deteriorating economic conditions in the last two months of the year. On a pro-
forma basis (excluding CBC and “plc” costs), for the twelve months of 2008, Foseco reported revenue of
£488 million and trading profit of £72.0 million, up by 18% and 24% respectively at reported exchange
rates compared with 2007.
Foseco’s operations have now been integrated into three of the four product lines within the Ceramics
division. Foseco’s ‘Foundry’ division now constitutes the majority of the Foundry product line, whilst the
activities of Foseco’s ‘Steel’ division are now included in the Steel Flow Control and Linings product lines.
For the first nine months of 2008, the Group’s businesses generally performed well. During this period, the
Ceramics division showed significant growth, including a better than expected contribution from recently-
acquired Foseco, the Electronics division maintained its performance at 2007 levels and the Precious Metals
division remained profitable. However, in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Group experienced a rapid and
significant softening in its principal end-markets, including an unprecedented reduction in global steel
production, combined with weaker automotive and consumer electronics markets. Despite prompt and
decisive action to reduce the Group’s cost base, this downturn had a significant negative impact on trading
results in the fourth quarter and, consequently, for the year as a whole.
Group revenue in 2008 of £2,203 million was 23% ahead of 2007 at constant exchange rates and up
36% at reported exchange rates. The increase in revenue at constant exchange rates principally reflected
the acquisition of Foseco on 4 April 2008 and the impact of higher metal prices being ‘passed through’ to
customers in the Electronics and Precious Metals divisions. Once these factors are excluded, underlying
revenue in 2008 decreased marginally by 2% compared to last year (at constant exchange rates). Revenue
for the Group is well balanced geographically with 41% coming from the Group’s operations in Europe, 27%
from NAFTA and 25% from Asia-Pacific.

OPERATING REVIEW (CONTINUED)
OUR BUSINESS
The principal products in Vesuvius’ Fused Silica product
line are Solar Crucibles™, which are used in the production of
photovoltaic (“solar”) cells. Global solar cell production
continued to grow well during 2008.
Following the 19% reduction in global steel production in
the fourth quarter of 2008 and weakening end-markets for
foundry castings, management took prompt action to reduce
the operating cost base of the division across all product lines.
In the fourth quarter of 2008, headcount was reduced with
over 250 temporary workers being released (notably in Europe)
along with 300 permanent positions. Overtime and premium
shift working was eliminated where practicable and extended
facility shutdowns were introduced over the Christmas and
New Year period to match the shutdowns initiated by a number
of our customers. In addition, in January 2009, the process was
initiated to permanently close six manufacturing facilities, one
in each of the UK, Mexico, Belgium and Germany, and two in
the US. Formal employee consultation procedures are now
underway and it is anticipated that the closures will be
substantially completed by the end of June 2009. This,
together with additional staff reductions in overhead positions
during 2009, will result in a further total headcount reduction
of over 600 people. A renegotiation of existing raw material
contracts is also currently in progress.
Following the acquisition of Foseco, the management
reporting responsibilities of the enlarged Ceramics division
were restructured on a product line, rather than geographic,
basis. This enables the business to better serve its
increasingly global customer base and also helps facilitate
the integration of the Foseco business. An overview of each
product line is given below.
Steel Flow Control
The Steel Flow Control product line provides a full range of
products and services to control, regulate and protect the
flow of steel in the enclosed continuous casting process.
These include VISO™ and VAPEX™ products, slide-gate and
tube changer systems and refractories, gas purging and
temperature control devices, mould and tundish fluxes and
ingot hot-topping systems.
Global steel production represents 100% of the end-
market for Steel Flow Control products and services.
Underlying revenue (at constant currency and as if Foseco had
been acquired with effect from the beginning of January
2007) grew by 1% for the year, marginally ahead of the 1%
reduction in global steel production. For the first nine months
of the year, underlying revenue grew by 7% but then fell
sharply in the fourth quarter reflecting the 19% reduction in
steel production in this period. This underlying growth,
combined with the integration of the steel flow control
operations of Foseco, resulted in reported revenue (at
reported exchange rates and only including Foseco from the
date of acquisition) of £427 million, a 2% increase on 2007 .
Underlying trading profit for the year (at constant currency
and as if Foseco had been acquired with effect from the
beginning of 2007) was 16% lower than for 2007 reflecting
the very difficult trading environment in the fourth quarter .
Capacity was increased in Europe with the construction
of a new £8 million facility in Ostend, Belgium, which became
operational at the end of 2008. Production of the more
standardised Steel Flow Control products has been
reallocated from our other European factories to this new,
highly automated facility to yield significant overall
productivity gains.

* Including pre-acquisition results of Foseco
Trading under the Vesuvius and Foseco brand names, the Ceramics division is the world leader in the
supply of advanced consumable products and systems to the global steel and foundry industries and a
leading supplier of speciality products to the glass and solar industries.
The acquisition of Foseco in April 2008 significantly expanded the existing Ceramics division and brought
together the two largest worldwide manufacturers of specialist ceramics for molten metal handling. The
enlarged division performed satisfactorily in 2008 with revenue of £1,265 million, up 62%, and trading profit
of £167.7 million, an increase of 53% (both at reported exchange rates), giving a return on sales margin of
13.3%. At constant exchange rates, revenue and trading profit were higher by 46% and 35% respectively.
Excluding the contribution from Foseco, underlying revenue was up 4%, trading profit was down 8% (both
at constant exchange rates) with the return on sales margin decreasing to 12.7% (compared to 14.0% for 2007).
Following the acquisition of Foseco, the key end-markets for Vesuvius are global steel production (which
accounts for just over half of the division’s revenue on a pro-forma basis) and the foundry casting market
(just over one-third of the division’s pro-forma revenue). The division’s other key end-markets are solar,
glass and industrial process plants.
End-markets continued to grow satisfactorily during the first nine months of the year and then
experienced a severe deterioration in the fourth quarter. Over the first nine months of the year, global steel
production was up 5% on the corresponding period in 2007. However, in the last quarter of 2008, many of
the larger steel producers, including ArcelorMittal, Tata Steel/Corus and Severstal, announced their intention
to cut back production in response to market conditions and to reduce inventories in the face of falling
demand. During October and November 2008, the number and scale of production cut-backs continued to
increase and, as a result, global steel production was 19% lower in the fourth quarter of 2008 than for the
corresponding period in 2007. Compared to the corresponding months in 2007, global steel production in
the months of October, November and December 2008 was lower by 14%, 20% and 24% respectively. For
the year as a whole, global steel production fell by 1% to 1.3 billion tonnes, the first annual decline in ten
years. China continued its position as the world’s leading steel producer with year-on-year growth of 3% and
accounted for 38% of the world’s total production in 2008. Global production outside of China was down
3%, with growth in India (up 4%) being more than offset by reductions in the US (down 7%), the enlarged
European Union (down 5%) and the CIS (down 8%).
The foundry castings market, which represents around one-third of the division’s revenue on a pro-
forma basis, produces castings which are used in a wide variety of engineered products and approximately
25% of the revenue from the division’s Foundry product line relates to the production of castings for the
automotive sector (being cars and light trucks). The foundry casting market was generally strong in the first
ten months of the year , particularly in Brazil, Germany, India and China. However , towards the end of the year
the market deteriorated significantly largely driven by an unprecedented reduction in automotive
production, particularly in the US and Europe.

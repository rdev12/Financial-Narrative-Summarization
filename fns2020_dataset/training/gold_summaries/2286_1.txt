Chief Executive’s review
“In 2013 improvements in business 
mix, plus the full year effect of 
the 2012 acquisitions, enabled 
Bodycote to achieve good growth 
and strong returns, despite weak 
markets in the early part of the 
year. ”
S.C. Harris l Group Chief Executive
Overview
Bodycote moved strongly ahead in 2013 despite mixed market 
conditions. Reported revenue grew by £31 .8m (5.4%) to £619.6m, 
albeit helped by a positive contribution of £14.2m (2.4%) from 
foreign exchange translation effects. This corresponds to a 3% 
growth at constant exchange rates. The acquisitions made in 2012 
contributed £32.4m, or 5.5%, with organic revenues declining by 
£14.8m (2.5%). Nearly all of Bodycote’s markets were weak in the 
first part of the year but, encouragingly, many strengthened as the 
year progressed.
Margins increased once again with progress in both the Aerospace, 
Defence & Energy (ADE) and Automotive & General Industrial (AGI) 
businesses. Group margins rose to 17 .3% from 16.6% in the prior 
year. ADE now has a margin of 27 .0% (2012: 26.8%) and AGI has 
improved to 14.7% (2012: 13.4%). These margin improvements 
are largely down to the continuing drive towards a better mix of 
business, notably from increased revenues generated in S
3
P and 
HIP Product Fabrication, and strong cost management. This can 
be seen very clearly when looking at the organic performance of 
the Group on a constant currency basis. Overall organic profit fell 
only £0.4m on £14.8m of organic sales decline. Both ADE and AGI 
saw organic sales declines, the former primarily driven by falling 
oil & gas demand and the latter driven by weak general industrial 
demand. The mix improvement and cost management efforts 
held organic headline operating profit decline in ADE to £0.9m on 
organic sales down £4.5m, while in AGI headline operating profit 
increased by £0.8m notwithstanding a £10.3m drop in organic 
revenues. Acquisitions added £6.7m of headline operating profit.
A key element of the Group’s success in these weak economic 
conditions was its ability to maintain price increases at or above 
cost inflation. In 2013, the business demonstrated its pricing power 
once again with price increases some £1 .6m greater than cost 
increases.
In 2013 headline EPS grew by 10% to 41 .2p while return on capital 
employed grew to 19.9% (2012: 17 .9%). The high quality of the 
Group’s earnings was underscored by the cash performance 
with a headline operating cash flow of £108.9m (2012: £110.8m), 
corresponding to a headline operating cash conversation rate 
of 101%. This was despite a 20% increase in capital spending. 
One of the consequences of Bodycote’s focus on high returns on 
investment and a constant focus on cash generation resulted in the 
Group finishing the year with net cash of £15.0m. This compares to 
£34.2m of net debt at the end of 2012.

The Group’s priority for the use of cash is firstly to fund organic 
expansion followed by enhancement of the core dividend. 
Acquisitions form the third priority after these first two items. 
Supplemental distributions will only be made if cash generation 
exceeds the immediate needs of the business and such a 
distribution can be undertaken without compromising the Group’s 
acquisition strategy or sacrificing its strong financial position. 
Strategic progress
The Group’s expansion in China continued with one new plant 
coming on stream in 2013. There is strong demand for Bodycote’s 
service offering in China, which is geared towards non-Chinese 
companies targeting the domestic Chinese market. Further facilities 
are currently in the planning stage for the emerging markets.
The market in Brazil remained challenging in 2013 and even though 
20 basis points of the Group’s margin improvement was derived 
from a better operating performance in Brazil, the business has 
yet to reach breakeven. Further progress is expected in 2014 with 
the focus now firmly shifted to sales expansion following the 
restructuring activities of previous years. Any improvement in the 
Brazilian economy in this region should have a significant positive 
impact, as operational gearing is likely to be very high on extra sales 
generated.
The new technologies of S
3
P and HIP Product Fabrication are 
starting to be meaningful contributors to the Group performance. 
Investment in these exciting technologies has been a focus for 
some five years now and they have moved from a virtual standing 
start to adding 40 basis points to the Group’s margins in 2013 
compared to 2012. Significant capacity expansion took place in S
3
P 
during 2012 and 2013 and more expansion will occur in the coming 
year. Meanwhile, extra Giga HIP capacity was brought online at the 
end of 2013 which will further assist the growth in the HIP business 
in 2014.
A significant focus in 2013 was the post-acquisition integration of 
the three businesses acquired in 2012. The integration has been 
virtually seamless and the new businesses together generated 
a 13% return on investment in their first full year of Bodycote 
ownership. No new acquisitions were made during the year. 
The Group continues to be on the lookout for value enhancing 
acquisitions.
Summary and outlook
In 2013 improvements in business mix, plus the full year effect of 
the 2012 acquisitions, enabled Bodycote to achieve good growth 
and strong returns, despite weak markets in the early part of the 
year.
At this early stage in the year and on a constant currency basis, 
the Board expects Bodycote’s growth initiatives to deliver further 
progress in 2014.

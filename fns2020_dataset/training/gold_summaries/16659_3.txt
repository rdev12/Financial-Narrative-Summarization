CHAIRmAN’S STATEmENT
JeFF HARRis
“I have been consistently impressed with the calibre and commitment of my 
colleagues throughout the organisation and the quality of our operations 
and customer relationships.”
i was very pleased to be asked to succeed Bob Beeston 
as chairman, following the Annual General meeting in 
may last year. i judged that cookson was a company 
with great prospects and i am delighted to see that this 
is now being demonstrated.
A number of factors have changed during the last 
twelve months. Our end-markets have improved 
from the unprecedented recession of 2008/09, 
although there is still further recovery to be seen. 
Our performance has improved as a result of firm 
management actions to lower our cost base, expansion 
in the higher growth, emerging markets and focus on 
product innovation. those actions will continue. Our 
prospects are improved as we benefit from strong 
market positions in recovering economies. Our share 
price performance has been encouraging with an 
increase of more than 50% during 2010.
t hese improvements have led to the Group reporting 
record levels of revenue (£2.55bn) and headline 
profit before tax (£222m); our employee numbers are 
gradually increasing as we recruit to meet increasing 
demand; and we are now recommending a return to 
dividend payments to our shareholders.
i am confident that the Group can continue to deliver 
further improvements in performance, as reflected by 
the three-year targets announced in January 2011 and 
detailed in the chief executive’s s tatement.
INITIAL ImPRESSIONS
Following my appointment in may, i have travelled 
extensively to visit cookson facilities in the Americas, 
europe and Asia. i have been consistently impressed 
with the calibre and commitment of my colleagues 
throughout the organisation and the quality of our 
operations and customer relationships. this was 
exemplified by our operations in china, which is now 
our largest country in terms of employees and earnings 
and where we have excellent, modern facilities with 
further new factories currently under construction to 
meet the strong market growth.
in terms of the functioning of the Board and its 
committees, i have been reassured to see the strong 
commitment to high standards of governance, a 
focused approach to risk management and a genuine 
attention to corporate social responsibility and, in 
particular, health and safety.
i also held meetings with our main institutional 
shareholders to hear their views on our business, 
management, governance and strategy. i am pleased to 
report that the feedback was both positive and supportive. 
FINANCIAL PERFORmANCE
Revenue of £2.55bn was 30% higher than that reported 
in 2009. Headline profit before tax nearly trebled to 
£222.1m and headline earnings per share more than 
trebled to 61.5p. Overall, post-exceptional items, we 
reported a profit for the year of £150.9m compared 
with a loss of £44.7m reported for 2009. net debt at  
31 December 2010 stood at £330m, a reduction of 
£41m from a year earlier.
DIVIDEND AND DIVIDEND POLICY
no interim dividend was paid during the year and the 
last dividend paid was an interim dividend of 8.8p 
in October 2008. As a consequence of the Group’s 
improved financial position and prospects, the Board 
is now recommending to shareholders a final dividend 
payment in respect of 2010 of 11.5p per ordinary share. 
As part of its three-year Group performance targets, 
the Board is targeting growing dividends from this 
base at least in line with the growth in earnings, with 
the next payment expected to be an interim dividend 
in October 2011.
BOARD AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
the Board is responsible for overseeing the Group’s 
strategy and monitoring its performance. in February 
2010, the Board was strengthened with the appointment 
of two additional members: peter Hill as a non-executive 
Director and François Wanecq, chief executive Officer of 
our c eramics division, as an executive Director.
Barry perry, who has been a non-executive Director 
since 2002, has decided not to stand for re-election at 
the next AGm and will therefore resign from the Board 
in may 2011. i would like to thank Barry for his valuable 
insight and the outstanding contribution he has made 
over the past nine years.
OUTLOOK
c onfidence in the sustainability of the global economic 
recovery is increasing and fears of a “double-dip” 
receding. i therefore expect the Group’s performance 
in 2011 will be well ahead of 2010.

 Immediacy has enjoyed 
signiﬁ cant growth.
The Group achieved revenues 
of £11.28 million (2006: £9.67 million), up 
17 per cent. compared to last year including 
the acquisition of Immediacy Limited. 
The Group reported an EBITDA loss excluding 
non-cash exceptional items of £1.30 million 
(2006: proﬁ t £0.96 million) for the full year. 
During the year, the Group lost £1.06 million on 
providing the Pepperio roll-out. Excluding this 
investment and the investment in US expansion, 
the Group was break-even at EBITDA level.
As at 30th September 2007 the Group had
£1.78 million (2006: £1.08 million) in cash 
excluding a three year term loan due 
of £1.90 million (2006: £nil).
In July 2007, the Group concluded the 
acquisition of Immediacy Limited which added 
a new product to the Group’s product portfolio 
addressing the medium sized enterprise market. 
The business has enjoyed signiﬁ cant growth in 
this market sector and this continued to be the 
case post-acquisition, reporting results slightly 
ahead of expectations during the last quarter.
Morello had a mixed year. Having enjoyed 
a proﬁ table ﬁ rst half, reporting signiﬁ cant wins 
at the Foreign and Commonwealth Ofﬁ ce and 
Ofﬁ ce of Fair Trading, the second half proved to 
be more challenging. The Group had anticipated 
that the launch of Microsoft Ofﬁ ce SharePoint 
Server (MOSS) 2007 would be a disruptive 
event in the Morello market and to counter this 
developed an innovative MOSS Connector to 
allow customers to leverage MOSS content in 
Morello. The Group experienced extended sales 
cycles whilst customers digested 
the merits of MOSS 2007 who eventually 
concluded that the Microsoft product did 
not meet the needs of Enterprise Content 
Management. In addition, sales opportunities 
in the Group’s ﬁ nancial vertical were also 
delayed by the turmoil in the Financial Markets 
toward the end of our ﬁ nancial year. As a 
consequence, Morello revenues grew by a 
modest 5 per cent. compared to last year. 
In line with stated policy, earnings for the 
foreseeable future will be reinvested to ﬁ nance 
the growth of the Group and acquisition 
strategy. Consequently the Directors do not 
recommend the payment of a dividend.

The Board is now conﬁ dent that the Group’s 
prospects are much improved as a result of the 
cost savings made. We now have every reason 
to believe that further progress will be achieved 
based on an encouraging start to the new 
ﬁ nancial year.
In conclusion, I would like to express my 
appreciation to all the management, staff 
and shareholders for their continued 
support during the year.

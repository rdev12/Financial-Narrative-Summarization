 8 Patsystems plc
I joined the business in January 2006 
with high expectations that our 
people, products and the opportunities 
within our market would enable us to 
build a highly successful business.
The results for the financial year ended 
31 December 2006 are a significant 
step in our ambition to become a key 
technology provider to the electronic 
trading industry and demonstrates 
that my initial impression as to the 
fundamental strength of this business 
was well founded.
The overall performance of the 
business has shown a significant 
improvement compared to the 
previous year with an operating profit 
under IFRS of £1.6 million compared to 
£0.3 million in 2005.
Underlying turnover has risen 15% to 
£15.3 million compared to £13.3 million 
in 2005. Underlying turnover excludes 
the revenue related to the provision 
of hardware and hardware support 
on the Tokyo Grain Exchange project 
in 2005 which was supplied at a low 
margin and is one-off in nature.
Despite the turnover growth the cost 
base has been closely monitored with 
the operating expenses being £13.3 
million compared to £13 million in 2005. 
TRADING SYSTEMS AND MARKET 
CONNECTIVITY
Trading systems revenue increased by 
15% to £13.3 million during the year.
The change in ownership of Refco in 
November 2005 did have a negative 
impact on recurring revenues in 2006, 
but revenue from new customers, 
and growth from existing customers 
compensated for that revenue 
shortfall.
During the year there were 
three additional installations for 
two existing customers in new 
geographical regions and nine 
installations for new customers 
to Patsystems. The new customer 
installations included JPMorgan in 
London, Citigroup in New York and 
Singapore, and CFETS, the People’s 
Bank of China subsidiary, in Shanghai.
At the start of 2006, we set an 
objective to establish Pro-Mark, our 
trading screen for the high-volume

electronic trader community. Though 
take-up of the screens was slower than 
anticipated in the first half of the year, 
by 31 December 2006 we had achieved 
129 billable users. 
Throughout the year we have 
continued to add functionality to both 
our retail and professional offerings.
At the Futures and Options Week 
(FOW) tradeshow in London in June, 
we launched trailing stops and 
brackets functionality for the J-Trader 
product. In the summer, additional 
functionality to support the trading 
of CME Eurodollar options, New York 
Mercantile Exchange NYMEX energy 
spreads and CBOT agricultural futures 
was made available in Pro-Mark. We 
also launched a plug-in tool to enable 
seamless integration of Microsoft Excel 
strategy spreadsheets with Pro-Mark.
Additionally, at the Futures Industry 
Association (FIA) exposition in Chicago 
in November 2006, we showcased our 
new charting capability that is being 
embedded within both our retail and 
professional trading systems.
During the year, all of our customers 
were upgraded to the latest version 
of our price distribution servers at an 
additional charge and all of our major 
customers took the option to upgrade 
to the latest version of our transaction 
servers.
The Global Trading project achieved 
our planned milestones for the year 
with the beta software release being 
available for the sponsoring customers 
for the last quarter of the year. Two 
of our major customers have signed 
contracts to upgrade to the new core 
architecture in 2007 and a further three 
are currently in discussions to schedule 
their projects for 2007.
Global Trading provides our customers 
with the ability to run the system 
continuously, with the down-time 
limited only to a minimal weekly 
clean-up period, and to deploy a 
number of instances of the software 
across diverse geographical locations 
while managing the software as a 
single instance. Most importantly, it 
enables our customers, through the 
Global Order Management capability, 
to view their overall customers’ 
trading and position activity. When 
Global Trading is combined with 
Risk Informer it enables Patsystems

“Berkeley Futures

well together in 
the support and 
promotion of 
Berkeley IQ-Trader.”

to provide a fully global electronic 
trading and risk solution on an open 
hardware platform.
The Global Trading product has been 
designed so that the existing trading 
front-ends, Pro-Mark and J-Trader, 
the Risk Informer product and our 
exchange connections will operate 
within both the Global Trading 
solution and the existing core system.
Connectivity has been further 
established to a number of additional 
electronic exchanges, bringing the 
total supported to 37. Connectivity 
was established to the Dubai Gold and 
Commodity Exchange and the Mexican 
Derivatives Market at the close of the 
year and we are encouraged by the 
further business opportunities that 
connections to new geographies, such 
as these, will bring to the business.
RISK SYSTEMS
The Tamesis business acquired in August 
2005 is now integrated fully into our 
operations and we remain confident that 
Risk Informer, the real-time risk margining 
product, will fulfil the expectations 
held at the time of acquisition.
We have enjoyed tremendous support 
from Calyon Financial, the Credit 
Agricole subsidiary, in establishing 
the Risk Informer product within our 
market. In March we announced that 
Calyon Financial chose Risk Informer, 
after a global selection process, as 
their preferred product for providing 
real-time risk margining for their 
futures business. 
Subsequent to our financial year-end, 
and directly resulting from the success 
of the earlier project, Calyon Financial 
has announced an extension of that 
project with Risk Informer to provide 
risk margining for their spot and 
forward foreign exchange and foreign 
exchange options business.
In October 2007, we announced that 
CFETS has also contracted to adopt 
Risk Informer to monitor risk for 
all the business that their members 
submit to the CME through the 
Patsystems CME gateway.
We enter 2007 with opportunities to

Connectivity has been further

EXCHANGE SYSTEMS
In 2005 we delivered the Tokyo 
Grain Exchange (TGE) project for 
the continuous market system. We 
have continued to provide TGE with 
additional services through out the year.
By their nature, opportunities for 
systems projects for electronic futures 
exchanges arise infrequently and 
the selection processes to appoint a 
vendor are usually in excess of nine 
months. Hence our business plans for 
2007 do not presume the winning of 
a new exchange systems contract. 
Nevertheless, we have several 
prospective opportunities that are 
in the early stages of their selection 
process and if we should be selected 
for either of these our 2008 financial 
results would benefit.
I am particularly pleased to see how 
the revenue mix for our exchange 
business has matured. The increasing 
proportion of recurring revenue within 
our exchange business enables us 
to identify 95% of anticipated 2007 
revenue coming from established 
customer relationships and being 
recurring in nature.
BRAND AND MARKETING
With a new range of products and 
an ambition to be seen within our 
sector as the technology partner of 
choice, rather than one of a number 
of independent software vendors, 
we decided at the start of 2006 
to fundamentally review how we 
position the business in our sector.
In the first quarter of the year, 
we carried out extensive market 
research with our existing customers, 
prospective customers and technology 
partners to assess the existing 
perception of Patsystems within the 
market. The research made it apparent 
that for our marketing to successfully 
support our business growth 
aspirations, we needed to move 
perception away from Patsystems as 
a supplier of excellent trading screen 
functionality to one of a capable and 
trusted technology partner.
In the second quarter of 2006, the 
target sectors and individuals were 
identified and the core Patsystems 
proposition to the market was defined.

Risk Informer: 
Is your approach to 
risk restricting your 
ability to take on 
new business?
Unlock the potential 
with Risk Informer. 12 Patsystems plc
On the back of this approach we 
launched a campaign for Risk Informer 
during the early summer that produced 
a good number of new sales prospects, 
extended awareness in our market 
place and generated a good level of 
press coverage.
In the third quarter, the key brand 
message and the revisions to our sales 
collateral, website and exhibition 
stands were established. At the core 
of this will be the establishment of the 
‘Total FlexAbility’ brand. In November 
at the FIA event in Chicago, we 
launched the new visual concept for 
our advertising and exhibition branding 
and also launched a completely 
refreshed and restructured website.
For 2007, we have substantially 
increased our planned expenditure 
for marketing to support the ongoing 
growth of our new products, and our 
penetration into new asset classes 
and trading communities. Additional 
expenditure has been allocated to 
promote the range of modules within 
our core offering available to those 
organisations wishing to take best 
of breed technology rather than a 
complete end-to-end solution.
BUSINESS RISK, STRATEGY AND 
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT
The principal business risks remain the 
same as in previous years:
Competition
The Group operates in a growing 
but competitive market. There are 
three major software suppliers in 
the global electronic trading systems 
market for futures and options, of 
which Patsystems is one. There are 
many smaller companies who supply 
screens, but not market connectivity. 
In such a market there is always a 
risk that customers could move to 
other competitors and there is always 
downwards pressure on margins. 
Patsystems mitigates this risk by 
supporting it’s brands with appropriate 
marketing activity and by consistently 
extending it’s market connectivity 
as well as improving it’s software, 
customer support and customer care.
Customer consolidation
Consolidation within the financial 
services industry has occurred over 
the past few years and further 
We plan to extend our sales functions in 
each of our operational regions and we 
are looking to extend the quality and 
level of support services we provide.
Chief Executive’s Report continued consolidation remains a risk. Where 
consolidation takes place the risk 
to our business is typically  to the 
revenues associated with market 
connectivity and support and 
maintenance. Patsystems mitigates  
this risk by actively adding new 
customers, products and asset 
categories to our portfolio.
Our business strategy remains 
unchanged with the ambition:
to extend the asset classes we 
support beyond futures and options 
on which we currently focus
to service products converting from 
open outcry markets to electronic 
trading; and
to broaden our presence beyond the 
locations where we presently operate.
We believe the reference sites we gain 
in 2007 will enable Risk Informer to be 
extended across trading of any type and 
will ensure that business opportunities 
are not limited to our historical market 
of futures and options.
For our front-end trading screens, we 
will be looking to extend functionality 
to strengthen our position in the market.
For the core system, we plan to extend 
the functionality to support crossing of 
internal and external order flow, which 
•
•
•
will benefit any of our customers 
considering becoming Systematic 
Internalisers under the new Markets in 
Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID).
Investment in exchange connectivity 
will continue to be in line with 
anticipated market demand for new 
product types and liquidity pools.
BUSINESS EVOLUTION
During 2007, we plan to extend 
our sales functions in each of our 
operational regions and we are 
looking to extend the quality and 
level of support services we provide, 
particularly in North America.
Currently, we have sales and support 
operations in Chicago, London, 
Report & Accounts 2006 13 New York, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. 
During 2007, we plan to extend our 
representation in Shanghai, Hong Kong 
and within North America and consider 
representation in other geographies. 
We expect to re-introduce trading 
systems support in Chicago, in addition 
to support functions in London and 
Singapore, to enable us to provide a more 
seamless support service 24 hours a day.
We have established performance 
benchmarks for our key operational 
areas and these will be monitored 
through out the year.
We are instigating a major change 
in our release policy to enable us to 
better serve our customers and to 
enable them to plan their software 
upgrades more effectively. From the 
first quarter 2007 onwards, we will 
switch to quarterly software releases 
for both our core systems and the 
front end trading screens.
EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT 
COMMITTEE
The senior executive team remains 
broadly the same as at the start of 
2006 with Kazuaki Takabatake as 
Head of Asia Pacific, Patrick Kenny 
responsible for North American 
operations, Graeme Neilly as Director 
European sales and global accounts 
and Jon Regan as Head of new 
business sales Europe.
In November 2006, Martin Coen left 
Patsystems and the opportunity was 
taken to better align the structure 
of our operations for the growth 
opportunities we expect for the 
business.
Andy Edwards, as product and 
development director, has taken 
responsibility for the aspects of 
Martin’s role pertaining to product 
selection and investment so that 
planning and resource management in 
this area are more closely aligned to 
the product development function.
Kieron O’Toole joined at the start of 
2007 as Client Services Director, with 
responsibility for software support, 
software releases, and trading and risk 
system installations. Kieron joins us 
with an accomplished track record in 
software company operations within 
the financial sector.

Chief Executive’s Report continued
…we are confident that we can 
deliver our planned turnover and 
profit growth in 2007 and 2008. This organisational change will enable 
Andy and Kieron to focus on maturing 
our development, support and 
implementation functions.
These six executives, plus Martin 
Thorneycroft and myself, constitute 
our Executive Management 
Committee. I am delighted to be 
leading such a committed and 
professional management team.
STAFF
I have enjoyed working with the 
Patsystems staff enormously in 2006, 
and I thank them for the positive 
manner in which I was received as the 
new CEO.
They should all feel great pride in what 
they have achieved in the business 
over the last year and I am sure they 
share my excitement as to what the 
future may bring for our company.
We do envisage a marginal increase 
in the number of employees over 
the coming year, as we increase 
headcount in our sales and support 
functions. Overall salary costs are 
budgeted to increase to reflect 
salary increases and anticipated 
bonus payments to staff, contingent 
on achieving the anticipated 2007 
financial performance.
BUSINESS OBJECTIVES AND OUTLOOK
Our key objectives for 2007 are as 
follows:
To establish the Patsystems 
FlexAbility brand and establish 
ourselves as technology partner of 
choice within our market place;
To grow substantially the Pro-Mark 
installed user-base;
To establish user communities for 
both Global Trading and the Risk 
Informer product;
To extend our technology into 
additional asset classes and
To deliver productivity gains within 
our product development, delivery 
and support functions to further 
increase our operating margin.
Trading subsequent to the year-end has 
progressed in line with expectations. 
Despite the planned amalgamation of the 
futures trading businesses of Calyon 
Financial and Fimat we are confident 
that we can deliver our planned turnover 
and profit growth in 2007 and 2008.

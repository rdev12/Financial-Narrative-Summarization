Chief Executive’s statement
Chief	Executive	Mark	Wood	commented:
“We have successfully refocussed the Ten Alps’ business and 
brought it back to profitability on an operational level.
“We have created a television production business of scale, 
transformed previously under-performing publishing assets 
and positioned our communications business for growth in 
both corporate communications and content marketing. 
Overall, the business is now improving. 
“The post-acquisition integration of Reef has gone smoothly 
and it is now co-located with Ten Alps’ own operations in 
its new single London office. Reef is currently performing to 
plan and Senior Reef executives are now a key part of the 
Group’s senior management team.
“Trading since the start of the new financial year has  
been encouraging and all business units are forecast to 
operate profitably throughout the current financial year.  
We are now seeing great momentum behind the Group  
and have secured 40% of our target full-year revenues  
before the end of the first quarter. 
“We will continue to pursue growth, both organically and 
through acquisition, to achieve scale as one of the UK’s 
leading content creation and story-telling businesses.”

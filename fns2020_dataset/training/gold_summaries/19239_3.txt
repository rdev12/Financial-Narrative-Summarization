CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
I’m delighted to be addressing 
shareholders following another 
very successful year.
For the fifth year in succession, 
management demonstrated the 
effectiveness and sustainability of their 
adopted group captive business model 
as a result of which your Company 
recorded consistently healthy margins. 
Maintaining our record for achieving 
unbroken fuel supplies and strong tariffs, 
we also benefited from reduced exchange 
rate volatility.
As well as delivering industry leading 
operational performance, management 
have built the Group from 20 MW to a fully 
developed 750 MW generator. Securing 
a reputation for building all of their 
controllables to time and within budget, 
the Group has delivered on its IPO 
commitments.
We are now a fast growth power generator 
with an attractive multi-locational asset 
base. And we still have important work to 
do to continue to satisfy the expectations 
of our customers. To this end management 
are looking ahead and wanting to provide 
customers with a one stop shop for  
all energy needs, both from thermal or 
renewable sources. The Company thus 
has the opportunity to closely replicate the 
diversity of the nation’s energy generation.
I expect the generation of cash from its  
full portfolio of assets to put the Company 
on the path to dividends. In addition 
through management’s pursuit of a  
growth strategy the Company is targeting 
enhanced returns at a time when India’s 
economic revival appears to be gathering 
momentum, and industry becomes a more 
thirsty consumer group. I’m therefore truly 
excited by the Company’s prospects as it 
now represents scale, robustness 
and growth.
Upon the completion of construction of 
our 750 MW portfolio I would like to take 
the opportunity to thank the management 
team and our employees and contractors 
for all their efforts in building this Company 
from the ground up and my sincere thanks 
to my Board colleagues.
In addition, on this special occasion 
of having delivered on all its promises, 
on behalf of the Company, I want to 
extend a very special thanks to all of 
our shareholders and lenders who have 
supported us over the last seven years 
since our admission to AIM.

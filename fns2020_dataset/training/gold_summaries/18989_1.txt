Strategy
Our aim at Mapeley is to become the leading owner and
operator of UK regional commercial real estate let to
Government or investment grade tenants. These tenants
tend to have predictable, long-term property requirements,
a dynamic well-suited to Mapeley’s business. Our business
is diverse, we own freehold assets, manage leasehold
assets, provide facilities management services and carry
out projects and refurbishment work for our clients.
Our Property Portfolio is valued at over £2 billion. 
We manage the payment of over £170 million in rental
payments each year to third party landlords through the
management of the leasehold assets we have contracted 
to control under our outsourcing contracts. In total we
own or manage over 2.3 million square metres of real
estate and our portfolio is spread throughout the entire
UK, in most towns and cities. 
The advantage Mapeley has is simple – more effective
management of property risk. Our scale and our in-depth
local market knowledge gained through acting as both
landlord and tenant, along with our operational expertise,
provides multiple opportunities for the Group to drive
returns for its shareholders.
Overview
Mapeley has had an extremely successful 2006 and has
delivered strong results in its ﬁrst full year as a public
company. In short, we have increased our Funds From
Operations (FFO) to £45.7 million, an increase of 79.2%
from last year, and this has enabled us to achieve good
dividend growth of 29.2% over 2006. In the year we paid
dividends equating to 168 pence per share, amounting 
to a fourth quarter annualised dividend yield of 4.5%*. 
We have achieved this strong performance by fully
deploying our nationwide operating platform and focusing
on the straight-forward fundamentals of our business
strategy; rigorous property and asset management of
our existing portfolio and a continued focus on acquiring
good quality assets at yields higher than our cost of capital. 
Whilst the UK real estate sector continued its strong rally
throughout 2006, evidenced by a 49.2% Total Shareholder
Return (TSR) from the FTSE 350 Real Estate Index, I am
pleased to announce that Mapeley has out-performed not
only this index but also the FTSE 250 Index (30.2%) and
FTSE EPRA Index (48.4%) by producing TSR of 55.6% 
for the year.
*Based on a closing share price of £39.70 on 29 December 2006.
6818 Report 2006.qxd  16/3/07  17:29  Page 07 We are committed to further growing our portfolio by
acquiring good quality real estate through both outsourcing
contracts and one by one acquisitions. On the single asset
acquisitions our criteria from the outset is to maintain 
a spread between the net initial yield on the property 
and our costs of ﬁnancing that acquisition. We do not
base our investment assessments on strong rental growth
assumptions, rather we prioritise our ability to retain
tenants in the buildings we acquire. We ensure this through
focused stock selection, good property management and
through building and maintaining trusting relationships
with tenants throughout the term of their occupation. 
During 2006 we have maintained our low vacancy rate of
3%. This, combined with the fact that 93% of our revenues
are derived from Government and investment grade clients
endorses our secure and stable investment proposition.
Organic growth
In 2006, organic growth outperformed our expectations.
We generated organic FFO of £32.2 million (2005:
£21.4 million), representing 70.5% of total FFO, an
increase of 50.5% over 2005. The £10.8 million increase 
in organic growth represented more than half of the
increase in total FFO. The key driver in this area has 
been the strong performance of our existing outsourcing
contracts. Our expert property team and asset managers
continue to leverage their signiﬁcant knowledge and
experience to outmanoeuvre the market and to exploit
any optionality across the estate for the beneﬁt of
Mapeley and its tenants. 
In addition, cost savings generated from both our newly
signed facilities management services contract and the
reﬁnancing of our HMRC portfolio loan facility have 
also contributed to our strong FFO result.
Acquisitions – Outsourcing
Throughout 2006 we continued to broaden our regional
presence and further strengthened our extensive 
operating platform through the addition of a further
outsourcing contract with the Identity and Passport 
Service (an Executive Agency of the Home Ofﬁce).
Volumes of outsourcing deals are difﬁcult to predict, 
given the extent and degree of cultural change that these
deals often involve, however, we were delighted to add
another Government client to our portfolio. I believe this
deal further highlights our position as a leading provider 
of real estate outsourcing services in the UK. 
We remain focused on winning new business in this 
area when such opportunities arise as we see these
contracts as an excellent source of growth. Our key
competitive advantages of active property management
and our regionally spread operating platform are vital
tools for us to deploy when assessing and managing 
such opportunities.
Acquisitions – Direct Property Investments
The operating platform also enabled us to add a further
31 single assets worth £366.4 million, spread throughout
the UK regions from Newcastle to Southampton. Individual
assets ranging from £1.8 million to £68.8 million in price
were acquired at an average yield of 6.6%. Approximately
half of these acquisitions were made ‘off-market’ both
through Mapeley’s proprietary acquisition database and 
by direct approaches to landlords, highlighting the strength
of our team and operating platform. 
As predicted, weight of money continued to push prices 
up throughout 2006, albeit with most of the focus of this
demand being on London. Our ability to continue to source
such a high quantity of deals in the UK regions off-market
will be key in securing attractive opportunities going
forward. We are conﬁdent that our operating platform will
continue to provide us with a real competitive advantage 
in this area.
Results and dividend
At Mapeley our main focus is growing our FFO in order 
to pay a stable and growing dividend to shareholders.
During 2006 we grew our FFO by 79.2% to £45.7 million
(2005: £25.5 million). 
The strong operational and ﬁnancial performance of the
business has enabled us to make four successive increases
in our quarterly dividend during 2006 and in total we
have raised the dividend in every quarter since we ﬂoated
the business back in June 2005. Over the 12 months 
of 2006 we have grown our dividend by 29.2% and
produced a total shareholder return of 55.6%. 
EBITDA increased by 44.4% to £93.6 million 
(2005: £64.8 million) and as at 31 December our 
total Property Portfolio was valued at £2,046.2 million
(2005: £1,645.8 million).

and again in October, raising a total of £196.8 million.
Both issues were for the purpose of re-ﬁnancing single
asset acquisitions we had already made. We are grateful
for the support of both new and existing shareholders in
these share issues.
People
None of Mapeley’s success would have been possible
without the full effort, creativity and enthusiasm of
its staff. Our staff are shareholders in the business and 
are motivated to make a full contribution to the Group’s
performance. I would like to thank every member of
staff for their hard work and dedication in 2006.
Outlook
I believe Mapeley is extremely well placed to continue its
strategy and we are committed to maintaining a strong
performance through both organic growth and further
acquisitions.
Whilst the commercial property market remains
competitive and the pressure on ﬁnancing costs 
increases, we continue to ﬁnd good opportunities 
to invest. So far in 2007 we have acquired £95.1 million 
of assets and have a healthy pipeline currently under
evaluation. Our acquisitions database continues to grow 
as does our knowledge of the markets we operate in 
and intend to target. Both of these factors continue to
drive our competitive advantage in acquiring attractive
regional assets.
2007 promises to be another exciting year for the UK real
estate sector, particularly following the arrival of REITs.
At Mapeley, we do not currently intend to convert to REIT
status as we already beneﬁt from similar tax advantages
to that which the REIT regime conveys. 
Mapeley offers an attractive yield and a real growth
opportunity to invest indirectly in the UK regional
property market in a tax efﬁcient manner. Mapeley is
well-placed to further ﬂex its strengths of in-depth local
market knowledge, strong relationships with tenants and
its diverse regional operating platform to drive further
shareholder value in 2007.
I look forward to the year ahead.

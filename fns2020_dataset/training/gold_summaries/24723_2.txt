Business management: The Group is a single segment investment management business governed by the Board, with sole discretion for setting the strategic direction of 
the business. Whilst the Group’s Executive Directors and key management are responsible for and have discretion over the day-to-day management of the business and 
support functions, all strategic, financial management and key operational decisions are taken centrally by the Board. The Board receives reports across product lines, 
distribution channels and geographic regions, and monitors financial performance and determines the allocation of capital centrally.  
Total income and AUM above exclude NSIM and corporate income but include Phoenix. 2010 AUM and income restatement reflect the transfer of UK Property Unit Trust 
from Investment Management to Property.

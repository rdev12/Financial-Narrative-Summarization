Sanderson – 150 years of 
producing luxury interior 
furnishings
Arthur Sanderson establishes himself in 
Islington, London, as an importer of French 
wallpapers. Merchandise features 
expensive, luxurious wallpapers, such as 
the panoramic and imitation-leather 
papers manufactured by Paul Balin of 
Paris, for whom Sanderson is the sole 
agent in England.
In January, the showroom occupies 53 
Berners Street; by April 1901 the company 
has also leased 51-55; this confirms 
Sanderson as the largest wallpaper 
showroom in London. The Sanderson family 
home in Chiswick is donated to the town for 
use as a free library in 1898 when the family 
moves to Kensington.
In August, Sanderson goes into 
receivership; three weeks later it 
is purchased by Walker 
Greenbank plc. The Sanderson 
bedlinen license is sold to 
Bedeck Ltd. Walker Greenbank 
invests heavily in product 
development and almost two 
years’ worth of collections are 
launched in the second half of 
2004, culminating in the return of 
new Options collections in 
January 2005.
Arthur Sanderson dies leaving 
the business in the hands of his 
three sons, the business having 
been renamed Arthur Sanderson 
& Sons the previous year. It now 
manufactures wallpaper at 
Chiswick. It is now well 
established as a leader in the 
decorating trade. 
In March Sanderson celebrates its 150th 
anniversary with a special collection of fabrics and 
wallpapers inspired by its archive, a three month-
long exhibition at the Fashion and Textile Museum, 
London and a coffee table book written by Mary 
Schoeser and published by Thames & Hudson.
In August, Sanderson’s new 
headquarters are established in 
Denham as the manufacturing at 
Uxbridge ceases; seven months 
later, in March 2001, there is a 
management buyout.
A textile-printing factory is 
established at Uxbridge, 
producing Sanderson’s own 
range of fabrics, which had been 
commission-printed since 1914. 
These are first called ‘Eton Rural 
Cretonnes’ and later ‘Eton Rural 
Fabrics’. The paint factory of 
Messrs Casson & Co. in Kensal 
Road, London, is purchased and 
the Berners Street showroom is 
expanded again.

Overview
Arthur Bengough Sanderson 
becomes the holder of a  
Royal Warrant as Purveyor of 
Wallpapers and Paints to King 
George V. This is said to be the 
first Warrant granted for the 
supply of these products.
WestPoint Pepperell is 
aggressively acquired by  
Farley Industries: in the following  
year Sanderson is sold to the 
largest textile manufacturer  
in the Netherlands, Gamma 
Holdings NV.
Sanderson products appear in the Festival of Britain on London’s 
South Bank, where the Royal Festival Hall is decorated exclusively  
with the company’s papers. Imported textiles are introduced; among 
the fabrics are those with designs by Picasso and Gio Ponti. Royal 
Warrants are granted to the firm in 1951 and 1955. Sanderson 
launches a series of exhibitions at Berners Street in 1952, 1954 and 
1956. Dersine Fancy Papers, introduced in 1935, are highly successful 
during the 1950s and 1960s. 
Consumers in this period 
become wealthier, younger and 
more interested in individualistic 
styles. Sanderson becomes part 
of the newly formed Reed 
International’s Decorative 
Products Division. Spectrum 
Paint is introduced.
Morris & Co. goes into voluntary 
liquidation. Sanderson buys the 
wallpaper business together with 
the rights to use the company 
name, acquiring blocks, 
logbooks and existing stock, 
including the entire contents of 
the Hanover Square showroom. 
Due to a massive paper shortage 
and rationing, no new Sanderson 
pattern books are issued from 
1940 until 1950. The Sanderson 
factories meanwhile engage in 
war work.
The company celebrates its 125th 
anniversary with a revamped 
showroom and an exhibition. 
WestPoint Pepperell, Inc. of Georgia, 
USA, purchases Sanderson from 
Reed International.
Sanderson celebrates its 
centenary in a long awaited new 
building at 58-60 Berners Street, 
designed by Slater & Uren (now 
The Sanderson Hotel).

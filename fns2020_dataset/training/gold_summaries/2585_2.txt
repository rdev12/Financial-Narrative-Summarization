Our operating priorities for the year were  
to commence selling CroFab® and DigiFab® 
in the US, to initiate the Varisolve® (PEM) 
Phase III programme and to expand our 
range of marketed products and pipeline.  
We achieved all three. At the same time,  
we achieved our key financial goals relating 
to revenue, gross margin, operating profit  
and cash management during a year of 
substantial investment.
Total revenue increased by 13.1% to 
£111.4m. Royalty revenues comprised 
recurring royalties of £60.1m, 11% higher 
than in the previous year, and milestones/
one-off income of £9.9m, £0.2m lower  
than in the previous year. Product revenues 
were 3% higher than in the previous year at 
£35.4m. Our recurring revenues (comprising 
recurring royalties and product revenues) 
grew by 8% in total to £95.5m. The 
contribution from Biocompatibles during the 
two months from 27 January to 31 March

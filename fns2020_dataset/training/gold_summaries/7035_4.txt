The Oil & Gas Systems division provides a range of 
technologies to the mid and upstream oil & gas markets. 
The business has a leading position in the larger LPG and 
LNG carrier segment for reliquefaction systems that are 
used to capture boil-off gas and return it to the cargo tanks 
during a vessel’s journey. The business also has a leading 
position in the growing market for floating regasification 
systems that allow operators to regasify LNG cargoes in 
a more cost-effective manner than traditional land-based 
receiving terminals. The business’ oil product range enables 
offshore production facilities to increase yields from 
diminishing oil fields, safely store and offload cargo as 
well as recover gas that is otherwise wasted. The business’ 
operations are based in Norway.

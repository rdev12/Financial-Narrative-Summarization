Chairman’s statement 
Overview
I 
am pleased to report that HomeServe has 
delivered against all of the targets we set at 
the start of the year, including a 4% increase 
in customer numbers and a retention rate of 
82.7% in the UK and £6.1m adjusted operating 
profit
2
 in the USA. 
We now have over 68m affinity partner 
households worldwide and have grown our 
worldwide customer numbers by 14% to 4.9m. 
The continued development of our customer 
portfolio, together with increasing policies per 
customer and high and stable retention rates, 
has delivered another year of strong earnings 
growth in all of our established markets.
Results
In the year, underlying revenue
1
 was up 15% and 
adjusted operating profit
2
 up by 14% to £119.2m 
(2010: £104.4m). Adjusted profit before tax

 was 
up 16% to £117.1m (2010: £100.6m) and adjusted 
earnings per share
3
 up 17% to 25.9p (2010: 22.2p) 
reflecting the growth in customer numbers, 
increased income per customer and the strong 
retention performance in all regions.
Free cash flow

 was £86.1m, up from £26.3m 
in the prior year with net debt at the end of the 
year of £11.8m (2010: £52.9m). Our balance sheet 
remains strong and the business continues to 
be highly cash generative.
On a statutory basis, revenue increased by 
27% to £467.1m, profit before tax has increased 
by 3% to £104.8m and earnings per share has 
increased by 5% to 24.0p.
Business developments
In the UK, our core utility marketing campaigns, 
together with our customer growth initiatives, 
have delivered a 4% increase in customer 
numbers (2010: 2.4%) with both water and 
heating policies higher than a year ago.  
In addition, our customers remain loyal with  
our UK retention rate stable at 82.7% (2010: 
83.0%), providing continued high visibility of  
our future earnings. HomeServe

In the USA we have achieved strong organic 
growth during the year with gross new policy 
sales of 0.45m, 55% higher than a year ago, 
and we continue to make good progress in 
signing new affinity partners and acquiring 
existing home emergency policy books. In 
addition to the agreements announced in April 
2011 with National Grid Energy Services and 
Southern California Gas, we signed new affinity 
agreements with two utilities representing 1m 
households. Since the year end we have also 
signed two further agreements representing 
0.15m households together with 10k existing 
policies. Our USA business now serves 0.9m 
customers holding 1.4m policies, up 57% and 
83% respectively on a year ago.
Doméo, our French joint venture, has delivered 
an 11% increase in customer numbers and 
our share of adjusted operating profit
2
 has 
increased by 44% to £8.2m. Gross new policy 
sales in the second half of the year were over 
10% higher than in the same period last year, 
with the new marketing initiatives introduced 
during the year delivering good results.
In Spain we now have 0.17m customers 
holding 0.22m policies, more than double the 
number a year ago. We have developed our 
sales channels during the year, introducing 
an outbound telesales operation and we 
are expanding our product range with the 
management of Indesit’s manufacturer 
warranty programme. 
We continue to invest in our New Markets 
operations. In SFG (our French warranty 
business), we are developing a post point of 
sale and manufacturer warranty business 
and have signed agreements with Indesit 
and Mistergooddeal during the year. We were 
also pleased to commence a 15 month test 
marketing agreement with Enel Energia in Italy. 
Across the world our membership businesses 
managed over 1.3m repairs, an increase of over 
13% over the past 12 months, with increasing 
customer satisfaction levels.
Shares and Dividend
On 2 August 2010 a 5 for 1 sub division of the 
Company’s share capital was implemented to 
improve the liquidity and marketability of the 
ordinary shares of the Company. 
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 7p  
per share bringing the total dividend for the  
year to 10.3p (2010: 8.8p). The dividend increase 
of 17% is consistent with our objective of 
increasing our dividend in line with adjusted 
earnings per share

.
People 
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank  
all of our people for their contribution to  
another excellent set of results. In particular, 
thank you to our engineers and call centre 
agents who worked so hard to maintain 
customer service levels during the difficult  
winter weather conditions experienced in  
a number of our operations.
In the UK our people have worked closely with 
the charity, Marie Curie Cancer Care, on a 
number of initiatives and we are making good 
progress towards achieving our target of raising 
£1m over 3 years.
Board
During the year we have continued to review 
the structure of the Board and took the decision 
to strengthen it with two new appointments. 
On 5 July we appointed Jonathan King, Chief 
Executive of HomeServe USA, as an Executive 
Director and on 23 November we appointed 
Stella David, Chief Executive Officer at William 
Grant & Sons, as a Non-Executive Director.  
I would like to formally welcome them both  
to the Board. HomeServe

The Group’s performance this year
ITE has delivered a good trading 
performance with increased revenue 
reflecting good trading conditions 
in most of its markets and a strong 
result from its biennial Moscow 
International Oil and Gas Exhibition. 
ITE’s main focus this year has been 
on the development of its business in 
the Asian markets of India, South East 
Asia and most recently China. These 
acquisitions and investments in Asia 
have had a relatively small effect on 
this year’s results, but will make a more 
significant contribution in the future. 
Revenues for the year of £192.3 million 
(2012: £172.3 million) represent a 12% 
increase over last year and are derived 
from volume sales of 793,000m
2
, 
marginally less than last year. Organic 
revenue growth was £12.3 million with 
the net biennial pattern accounting for 
an additional £3.9 million of revenue, 
and first time contribution from 
acquisitions a further £3.8 million. 
Gross profits increased by £10.4 
million, of which circa £3.8 million 
is attributable to the net biennial 
pattern. The good trading result was 
achieved during a period of higher 
levels of planned investment made in 
the management and infrastructure 
of the Group. This reflects both 
the full year costs of businesses 
acquired last year and supporting 
the Group’s expansion in Asia.
Mosbuild, the Group’s largest and most 
profitable event performed well this 
year in a competitive environment, 
and delivered volume and revenue 
growth. The Group’s other large events 
traded well, but the main drivers 
of organic growth in revenues and 
gross profits were the next tier of 
medium sized events and the regional 
offices as the Group’s portfolio 
becomes increasingly diversified. 
Trading conditions in most of our 
markets were good throughout 
the year with the Russian regional 
offices of Siberia and Krasnodar, 
together with Azerbaijan all putting 
in strong performances and all 
reporting revenue growth of more 
than 10%. Trading conditions in the 
other Central Asia markets were also 
good and supported strong revenue 
growth. The UK, Turkish and Ukrainian 
businesses performed less well. The 
UK and Ukraine were hampered by 
difficult economic conditions and 
the Turkish business was impacted 
by space constraints on its largest 
events and a weaker Turkish Lira.
The main factors affecting Group 
profitability this year are summarised 
in the profit bridge on page 13. 
Development of the business
The main objectives for the Group 
this year were securing the position of 
ITE’s premiere Moscow construction 
event, Mosbuild, in its new competitive 
environment and continuing with the 
business expansion programme in Asia. 
Mosbuild performed well this year, 
selling more space than last year and 
growing its revenue base, but delivered 
slightly lower profits than last year. 
More importantly visitor and exhibitor 
research confirmed that its positioning 
as the ‘must attend’ construction 
event had not been affected by 
the recent change in venue and 
format of the event. ITE is continuing 
to invest in the event to ensure 
Mosbuild retains its current status.
The Group has now established a 
strong business base in Asia and the 
acquired businesses are performing 
well. In December last year we 
acquired a 28.3% minority stake 
in ABEC, a major Indian exhibition 
business, with an option to take a 
controlling position in 2015. We have 
spent this year developing the working 
relationship with ABEC’s management 
and establishing where we can best 
co‑operate between our respective 
businesses. This has resulted in a 
repositioning of our existing Indian 
business which now runs alongside 
the ABEC business. In January of this 
year we acquired a small maritime 
event alternating between Singapore 
and Hong Kong, to form the base 
for the launch of an ITE transport 
infrastructure brand in Asia, TransAsia. 
Also in January we acquired a 75% 
majority position in Tradelink, owner 
of Metaltech, the leading metalworking 
event in Malaysia. With the retention 
of the existing management, this event 
has the potential to be a platform for 
growing other metalworking events 
in Asia. In April we agreed terms to 
form a joint venture with the owners 
of ECMI, a Malaysian based business 
running its Beauty and Laboratory 
events in Malaysia, Indonesia and 
Vietnam. This joint venture provides 
ITE with a fast track route to launching 
exhibitions across South East Asia. 
It has already helped generate the 
launches of Paperex (from India) in 
Indonesia, and Beauty and Oil & Gas 
events in Myanmar for next year. In the 
autumn our UK fashion business MODA 
agreed terms to co‑operate on a 
recently launched event for menswear 
in Hong Kong. In November we were 
able to announce the formation of a  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

CHIEF ExECUTIvE’S

joint venture to develop exhibitions 
in the coatings and surface finishing 
industries by investing £33 million in 
a 50% shareholding in the Chinacoat 
exhibition business. As well as 
acquiring a stake in one of the leading 
exhibitions in the world in this growing 
sector, the purpose of the joint venture 
is to use the Chinacoat brand and data 
to support a roll out of other events 
across the manufacturing countries 
of Asia, and into the end user markets 
of Russia and the CIS. ITE is committed 
to building a network of offices across 
Asia and now has representation in 
Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong and on 
the South Eastern Chinese seaboard. 
It is important for ITE to invest in 
building the ‘brand’ and profile of its 
events to support the development 
of portfolios along vertical industrial 
lines. This aspect of our strategy 
was exemplified by the acquisition 
in October of Beauty Eurasia, the 
principal event serving the beauty 
industry in Turkey. Aligned with 
the beauty events we acquired 
in Ukraine last year and the ECMI 
beauty exhibitions run in Malaysia, 
Indonesia and Vietnam, ITE now has an 
opportunity to build a strong presence 
in the beauty sector in more markets.
In Russia, the benefits of common 
brands and systems developed over 
the last few years are now being 
realised with an active programme 
of replicating and cross‑marketing 
events into and across the regional 
markets. New opportunities are 
expected to arise from the expansion 
in regional venue capacity over the 
next few years. Recently we have 
seen new regional exhibition centres 
developed in Ekaterinburg and 
Novosibirsk which have helped to 
generate renewed levels of growth in 
the local exhibition businesses. Over 
the course of 2014 the Expoforum 
venue will open in St Petersburg. 
This is a major new venue of 50,000m
2
 
gross with conference facilities that 
will present new opportunities for the 
further development of exhibitions and 
conference businesses in the North 
West of Russia. In the South West, 
ITE’s Krasnodar office has signed an 
agreement to be the principal user 
of a new venue, which will add over 
30,000m
2
 of quality exhibition space 
in the city. The new venue should 
be completed and ready for use by 
2016. The Group is well positioned 
to participate in the growth that 
these investments in local exhibition 
facilities are expected to generate. 
ITE’s objectives and strategy
ITE’s principal objective is to create 
a business with sustainable growth 
in headline earnings per share. Its 
strategy is to develop positions of 
market leadership in the exhibition 
business in emerging and developing 
(high growth) markets.
Four priorities underpin ITE’s strategy: 
 – Build on existing positions of 
market leadership 
 – Expand into new sectors and 
geographies with potential for 
strong market positions 
 – Enhance and improve our 
exhibition brands 
 – Invest in developing our people
ITE’s performance against its 
strategic priorities is set out below:
(i) build on existing positions of 
market leadership:
ITE’s existing positions of market 
leadership are founded on its ability 
to generate international sales, its 
recognised brands, its local office 
infrastructure and its longstanding 
relationships with venues.
International sales strength 
ITE’s ability to generate international 
sales has differentiated it from its 
local competition in Russia and the 
related CIS markets. Through its 
subsidiary sales offices the Group has 
established a loyal customer base and 
a geographic reach which is hard to 
replicate for competitors. In 2013 the 
total net metres sold by the Group’s 
international sales offices increased 
by 15% to 133,000m
2
. This represents 
circa 25% of the Group’s 2013 revenues, 
an increase on 2012 reflecting the 
Group’s investment in building‑up 
its international sales presence last 
year, including opening a new sales 
office in Malaysia to target potential 
customers from South East Asia. 
Approximately 11% of revenues were 
sold by the Group’s London office, 4% 
by its German office, 3% by its Chinese 
office and 3% by its Turkish office. 
ITE’s international brands
ITE has established strong brand 
identities in certain exhibition sectors. 
In particular, the Build brand in 
construction, the Oil & Gas events 
brand, the ITE Travel exhibition and 
World Food brands all have strong 
reputations with customers as leading 
events in the Russian and CIS markets  Strategic report Governance Financial statements

earned through more than fifteen years 
of sustained good performance. The 
Group is working to ensure that the 
new construction businesses in the 
Group, notably in Turkey and India, are 
aligned with ITE’s historic construction 
brand and that all the benefits available 
from sharing best practice are realised. 
The acquisition of Beauty Eurasia 
and ECMI has created an opportunity 
for ITE to build an internationally 
recognised brand in this sector. 
There are also a number of developing 
brands in security, transport, 
packaging, printing and mining events 
which have prospects to support 
new events in different markets. 
Building ITE’s local office 
infrastructure 
ITE’s brands have built their reputation 
through sustained delivery of 
successful exhibitions to customers. 
The foundation of this is in ITE’s 
local offices which now employ over 
900 staff. Local offices generate the 
local sales, reputation and visitor 
participation of the event as well 
as managing technical staging of 
the exhibitions. Critically they own 
and develop the database of local 
visitors who make the exhibition 
successful for the exhibitors. In its 
core markets, ITE’s local offices have 
always been a competitive advantage 
over other international exhibition 
organisers and a barrier to entry for 
new organisers wishing to run events. 
ITE will continue to develop strong 
local offices as part of its exhibition 
business in new markets. The Group 
has an integration programme for new 
offices acquired into the ITE network 
and is increasing its investment in the 
infrastructure that underpins these  ITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013

offices and in staff training. The Group 
has high rates of employee retention 
in its offices, and supports this by its 
commitment to having widespread 
equity ownership – currently more 
than 60% of staff participate in 
some form of equity scheme. 
Maintaining venue relationships
ITE has always enjoyed longstanding 
relationships with the venues that 
host its exhibitions. In its core markets 
ITE has supported the development 
of venue facilities which in turn has 
helped the Group’s exhibitions to 
prosper. The Group has always sought 
to establish rights to run its main 
exhibition themes in its partner venues 
at the time of its choice and ITE has 
continued to work on maintaining and 
improving the venue relationships 
that underpin its business. Most of 
ITE’s major events have agreements 
which provide for venue facilities 
for at least three years ahead. This 
year ITE has agreed to support the 
development of a new venue in 
Krasnodar, where ITE will have the 
exclusive rights to run exhibitions. 
(ii) Expand into new sectors and 
geographies with potential for strong 
market positions:
In existing markets this strategy means 
targeting new sectors or regions in 
which to acquire or develop exhibitions 
where there is potential for the 
participation of international exhibitors. 
In new markets, ITE is targeting the 
development of exhibition businesses 
where there is clear opportunity 
for strong future growth. 
This year the Group has expanded its 
business presence into India, South 
East Asia and China. In so doing it has 
acquired expertise in new sectors – 
some of which have potential in ITE’s 
core markets, and also made it possible 
for the Group to run its existing brands 
in the new markets. The launch of 
TransAsia, Paperex Indonesia and Oil 
& Gas Myanmar are good examples of 
the opportunities created by access 
to new marketplaces. In time the 
Group will benefit from extending the 
newly acquired Chinacoat and Beauty 
portfolios back into its core markets.
As the Group’s acquisition activity 
over the last two years has opened 
up access to new markets, there are 
now increasing synergies and benefits 
to be gained from strengthening 
its industry portfolio in each sector. 
The Group aims to increasingly focus 
its acquisition activity on building 
portfolio strength and leadership 
in exhibition sectors – creating 
stronger more defensible business 
positioning for its exhibitions. 
(iii) Enhance and improve our 
exhibition brands: 
The Group’s management has been 
working to improve the strength of 
ITE’s existing international brands. 
This is being achieved by introducing 
product improvements to enhance 
customer experience and ensuring 
consistency in the presentation and 
promotion of similar events in ITE’s 
vertical industry sectors. The Group’s 
brand development projects have 
covered all aspects of product quality, 
naming, character, tone‑of‑voice and 
graphic designs associated with events 
in the Group’s largest portfolios. The 
improvements will deliver numerous 
benefits, including increasing the 
global recognition of ITE’s brands 
and enabling the Group to launch 
‘cloned’ events into new territories.
(iv) Invest in developing our people:
We have made some good progress 
in developing the strength and depth 
of the leadership and management 
teams in the year as well as improving 
the communication between the 
different offices. We have improved 
our talent management processes, 
including identifying and addressing 
individual development needs. 
Our rolling programme of internal 
senior management and functional 
conferences has been a huge success 
as has the leadership development 
programme. We have also continued 
to extend and develop internal 
communication between offices 
and opened up communication 
by functional management i.e. 
connecting staff lines across the 
different offices such as construction/
marketing/IT and finance. 
ITE’s strategic objectives are 
unchanged. We have been successful 
in establishing positions in new 
markets and the future accent will be 
more orientated towards development 
of brands and industry verticals 
in order to leverage the potential 
synergies of the newly acquired assets.

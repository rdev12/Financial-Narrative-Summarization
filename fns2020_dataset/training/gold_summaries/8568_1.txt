 Chief Executive’s Statement
4
I am pleased to report that the past
year has been a period of significant
progress for iTouch, both from a
financial and an operational
perspective. Strong performance
across all financial metrics was
achieved and our position as one
of the leading mobile value added
service providers in Europe was
consolidated.
Excellent financials
iTouch achieved significant financial
milestones during 2004. Group revenue
increased by 29% to £78.0m from
£60.3m in 2003 and EBITDA progressed
to £8.1m up from a loss of £0.1m last
year. We achieved positive cash flow at the
operating level for the first time and profit
before tax (before exceptionals) for the
full year was £3.7m. This strong financial
performance reflects the important
corporate progress iTouch has achieved
during 2004 by scaling the direct channel
model, so successfully pioneered by
Movilisto in Spain, into all iTouch territories.
Strategy for growth
Our overriding aim is to facilitate and
maximise the number of transactions
generated by mobile users through the
iTouch global offering. This will be
achievable through a strategy for growth
underpinned by five key themes:
Extending our distribution into
new territories
In 2004, we launched the direct channel
model in five new territories – Morocco,
Australia, France, Romania and Poland –
taking the total to nine countries before
our acquisition of Jippii Mobile
Entertainment in September. Jippii extends
our distribution to 25 markets, adding
Russia, Switzerland, Belgium and a
number of Eastern European territories. 
In addition, iTouch will pursue further
corporate activity to complement and
enhance our position both in Europe and
in developing markets further afield
such as India, China and South America
where handset penetration is growing
significantly.
Developing the direct channel model
Our direct channel model utilises direct
response television and print advertising
to drive the end user purchase of mobile
content. In 2005, we will invest in
strengthening the Jippii web and mobile
portal offerings as an extension of this
strategy to more firmly establish our own
marketing channels. The web portal, which
is currently live in 21 countries and
localised in 14 languages, allows us to
showcase our wide range of mobile
products. 
Establishing a global youth portal
Jippii is being introduced as the Group’s
youth brand in 2005 to leverage the
advertising spend and encourage users to
regularly visit the community driven web
portal. Our goal is to expand further Jippii’s
market position as one of the leading
youth portals and extend it into new
territories with partners where we do not
already have a presence.
Enhancing our product offering
Although the majority of iTouch’s revenues
in 2004 were still generated from 2G
products and services, we already have
an extensive range of products compatible
with 2.5G handsets. In 2005, we expect
to make rapid progress in providing the
next generation of products and services
to scale into iTouch territories. We will pay
particular attention to key product verticals
such as music, games, gambling, chat
and dating.
Extending our content relationships
During the year, deals were signed with
Dreamworks for Shrek 2, Eurofun for
Shark Tale, Elkware and Mobile2Win for
Java games and Zingy for original hip hop
A-list voice tones. Our customers can now
access an extensive database of items. 
This year we will be looking to build on 
our core relationships and seek out 
2005 will see strong growth in multimedia
data services as we reach critical mass in 
2.5G handset penetration and operators begin
to push 3G services.

original content to leverage our extensive
distribution network.
Staff dedication and commitment
Where 2003 was a year of transformation,
2004 has seen iTouch deliver its maiden
year of profitability. This is testament to the
dedication and commitment of our staff
and, on behalf of myself and the Board,
I would like to thank them all.
Outlook
The mobile data market is set to grow
exponentially in the next few years driven
by penetration of 2.5G handsets and the
launch of 3G. 
By 2008, mobile gaming alone is forecast
to generate $8.4bn, whilst ringtones and 
iTouch licenses content and creates
propositions that we then distribute 
to mobile users by marketing directly 
to end users (e.g. using the shortcode
8181 in the UK), via operator portals 
(e.g. Vodafone Live), or via affiliate
partners (e.g. Siemens).

further shareholder value.

 2 Christie Group Annual Report 2014
This was primarily due to a resurgence
in corporate transactional activity and
related advice - our third year-on-year
increase in operating profit before
exceptional items. As a result, the Group
generated cash in the year of £2.1m. 
Stock & Inventory Systems & Services
Revenue for the division increased by
7.4% to £27.8m (2013: £25.9m). £0.8m of
this increase in revenue was attributable
to a full year’s revenue from our
German-based stocktaking operation,
which we acquired in September 2013. 
Having incurred the effects of
reorganising our German business – a
significant factor in reporting divisional
operating profit of £0.2m (2013: £1.1m) -
we now have the capacity to undertake
double the current volumes there,
positioning us to take advantage of
growth opportunities in the central and
eastern European region.
The UK retail stocktaking market supply
has gone through a period of strong
margin pressure. We have not been
immune from the consequences. We
believe we have the lowest cost base of
any national operator, whilst also
delivering a high level of accuracy.
Our hospitality stocktaking business
continued its growth. We also enjoyed
further take-up of other services such
as Health & Safety and Compliance
Audits, and growth in consultancy,
particularly in the food area.
Professional Business Services
The PBS division had an excellent year,
with revenue of £33.2m representing
growth of 17.5% on the previous year
(£28.3m). The result was operating
profit of £3.3m (2013: £0.9m before
exceptional items).
For the fifth year in succession, Christie
+ Co has been voted the UK’s most
active hotel and leisure agent by the
Estates Gazette. Our corporate hotel
transactions in 2014 have been well
reported. Encouragingly, our private
client derived profits grew in proportion.
As average business values increased,
so too did our commission income.
We have increased staff numbers to
take advantage of the upturn. New
staff are not instantly productive and
increased income should materialise
from H2 onwards.
Our medical sector work grows apace.
We have built a pipeline of dental
practice sales for completion this year .
Strong demand for business valuations
and a relative shortage of skilled
practitioners saw a sustained rise in
fees at both Pinders and Christie + Co.
With commercial building activity
strong, our building surveying team
were very busy throughout the year .
Our Germanic and Scandinavian
markets are sound. We are seeing
recovery in Spain. France continues
to be a more difficult economy. The
relative weakness of the euro is likely
to encourage further international
investment into eurozone assets in
the period ahead. We should benefit
from such activity.
Outlook
The results for 2014 were ahead of
expectations. For this I thank your
management and staff and our loyal
and growing client base.
We look forward to continued growth for
2015. Inevitably the election will disrupt
the markets in some way. Thereafter
activity should resume in what are
fundamentally attractive markets into
which we provide essential demand
driven services.
Your board recommend a final dividend
of 1.5p per share (2013: 1.0p), a total of
2.25p for the year (2013: 1.5p) and a
50% increase above the prior year .
If approved the dividend will be paid on
3 July 2015 to those shareholders on
the register on 5 June 2015.

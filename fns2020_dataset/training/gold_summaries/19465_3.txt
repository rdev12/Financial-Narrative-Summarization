STRATEGIC REPORT
Strategy
In Specialist Building, the Group concentrates on 
the High Quality Residential market in London 
and the Home Counties. Our expertise is in 
refurbishment of prestigious private residential 
projects where we specialise in engineering 
solutions for major structural alterations. 
In Engineering Services, the Group continues 
to develop its position as a leading provider of 
engineering services to support critical UK assets 
in the Energy , Environmental and Infrastructure 
markets. The markets we operate in are mainly 
governed by regulation. Our operations focus 
on the long-term programmes of essential 
maintenance spending in these markets, which 
provide good visibility of future opportunities 
and more sustainable earnings streams. 
It remains the Board’s strategy to continue the 
growth of its Engineering Services business, both 
organically and through selective acquisitions. 
Over the last nine years, Renew has completed 
six major acquisitions without recourse to 
shareholders for funding. Substantial, profitable 
growth has been generated from this strategy 
which, complemented by organic growth, has 
enabled the Board to deliver a six fold increase 
in market capitalisation since 2006. In recent 
weeks, the Board has seen a number of good 
quality , potential acquisitions across all market 
sectors of our Engineering Services business 
and we continue to pursue appropriate earnings 
enhancing additions to the Group. 
Outlook
The Group enters the 2015/16 financial year 
in a strong position.
The Board previously published targets for 
2017 of Group revenue in excess of £500m, 
Group operating profit margin prior to exceptional 
items and amortisation of 4.5% and growth 
in EPS on that basis of at least 40% from the 
reported level of 20.8p in 2014. The Group 
revenue target has been achieved with these 
results. The Group has also delivered an 11% 
improvement in Group operating margin to 
3.9% and a 25% increase in EPS giving the 
Board confidence that the Group is on track 
to deliver on these strategic targets.

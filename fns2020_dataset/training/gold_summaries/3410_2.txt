Chime has identified four market growth drivers in sport and entertainment, healthcare communications, digital, and the 
world’s growing economies.
In recognising these areas and to enhance shareholder returns, Chime has a strategy of developing its existing businesses, 
supporting organic growth, investing in start-ups, and expanding its operations overseas, particularly in economies which 
forecast strong growth. This overseas expansion will be delivered through taking existing businesses to those markets, 
opening new offices and/or making acquisitions in the countries identified.
We measure our progress in delivering shareholder returns utilising six Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

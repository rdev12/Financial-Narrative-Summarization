Chairman’s Statement
Introduction
I am pleased to be able to report another successful year for 
eg. The business has built upon the solid foundations 
established between 2007 and 2009 to deliver strong 
profitable growth and further strengthened our platform for 
future expansion. As anticipated, the past year has seen the 
full potential of the back office optimisation market starting to 
emerge, in both the UK and overseas. At the same time 
financial institutions have continued to focus on minimising 
back office costs and improving operational control. This has 
translated into strong demand for eg’s products and services 
with trading in the second half of the year continuing the 
momentum of the first half. 
The growth in revenue achieved reflects contract wins from 
both new and existing customers, with a strong performance 
by our South African business which reported more than £1.2 
million of revenues during the full year (2010: £0.35 million). 
The UK business benefited from significant repeat business 
from existing customers as well as the order pipeline of XTAQ, 
acquired in March 2010, converting according to plan. 
We have continued to maintain tight control over costs, taking 
action in the second half following the acquisition of XTAQ to 
reduce the overall cost base. This resulted in improved 
margins and strong operational cash flow.
Financial results
Our financial performance demonstrates our success in 
creating a business platform that can consistently generate 
and sustain high quality revenue. Last year total revenues 
increased by 24% to £5.1 million (2010: £4.2 million), with 
software licences, maintenance and software services 
contributing 68% of revenues (2010: 70 per cent) and the 
balance coming from implementation and training services. 
Overall gross margin for the year was maintained at 63% 
(2010: 63 per cent) although, excluding sales of third party 
licences by XTAQ, underlying gross margin on our core product 
sales improved.
Underlying profit before tax and costs relating to the XTAQ 
acquisition increased by 355% to £0.5 million (2010: £0.1 
million), demonstrating the scalability of the business, with 
strong revenue growth being achieved on a well managed cost 
base. Costs relating to the XTAQ acquisition comprises 
£96,000 (2010: nil) consisting of £67,000 professional services 
costs and £29,000 management costs. 
After a tax credit of £127,000, underlying profit after taxation 
and costs relating to the XTAQ acquisition was up 535% to 
£0.6 million (2010: £0.1 million). 
Operating cash flow was £814,000 (2010: £728,000). The 
Company has a healthy financial position with cash and cash 
equivalents at 31 January 2011 of £0.5m (2010: £0.4 million).
The Board is not recommending the payment of a final 
dividend as we continue to re-invest profits in expanding the 
business. 
Current trading and outlook
The momentum of last year has continued into the start of this 
year. We have a strong sales pipeline and expect to continue 
to win new contracts from new and existing customers, as well 
as benefiting during 2011/12 from contracts won last year. 
Current trading is positive with contracted and recurring 
revenues accounting for 54% of our forecast revenues for the 
year (2010: 52 per cent). 
The Board plans to build on this success and we are confident 
of further profitable growth in the current year.

Cineworld Group plc results for the 53 week period ended  
1 January 2015 reflect the trading and financial position of 
Cineworld Cinemas, Cinema City and Picturehouse (the “Group”). 
Cinema City Holding N.V. and its subsidiaries (“Cinema City”) 
became part of the Group on 28 February 2014 and was 
consolidated for the final ten months of the period.
Unless explicitly referenced, all figures in the commentary below 
are on a pro-forma 52 weeks for 2014 v 2013 and calculated by 
excluding the trade of week ending 1 January 2015, the final 
week of the period. Where percentage movements are given, 
they reflect performance on a constant currency basis to allow 
a year-on-year assessment of the performance of the business 
eliminating the impact of changes in exchange rates over time. 
Constant currency movements have been calculated by applying 
the 2014 average exchange rates to 2013 performance.
Total revenue in the 53 week period ended 1 January 2015 was 
£619.4m. On a 52 week v 52 week pro-forma basis, this equates 
to an increase of 1.7%. Overall admissions decreased by 0.5%, 
with box office revenues increasing by 0.7%. The impact of  
the fall in admissions was mitigated by average ticket prices 
increasing by 1.3% to £4.72. Spend per person increased by 
3.6% to £1.67 resulting in retail revenue growth of 3.1%. Other 
revenues increased by 4.0%.
Overall, the impact of the 53rd week in 2014 resulted in 3.5%  
of revenue growth for the Group.

Box Office
The principal income for Cineworld Cinemas is box office 
revenue. Except for the revenue generated by Cineworld 
Cinemas’ subscription services, box office revenue is a function 
of the number of admissions and the ticket price per admission, 
less VAT. On a 52 v 52 week basis, admissions in the period 
were down 4.0%, but an increase in average ticket price of 
4.0% resulted in flat box office revenues. Box office revenues 
generated by the UK & Ireland cinema industry as a whole were 
down 2.7% during the same period (Source: Rentrak).
The increase in average ticket price was in part due to an 
inflationary price rise during the period, but also reflective of 
the film mix. There were a higher proportion of adult admissions 
during the period, coupled with the impact of our successful 
strategy to expand our IMAX offering to an additional five sites, 
and the popularity of 3D. The proportion of customers attending 
during the weekend has increased slightly from the comparative 
prior year period, which has also contributed to the increase in 
average ticket price.
As a Group, we are committed  
to ensuring our customers have  
the best possible experience when 
visiting our cinemas.  Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Overall box office performance was affected by the weaker 
film slate for the year and also impacted by the Football World 
Cup in the Summer. In comparable 52 week periods, in the  
UK as a whole the top three films in 2014 grossed £100.4m 
(“The Lego Movie” – £34.3m, “Inbetweeners 2” – £33.4m and 
“Dawn of the Planet of the Apes” – £32.7m) compared to the 
top three films in 2013 which grossed £125.1m (“Despicable  
Me 2” – £47.4m, “Les Miserables” – £40.7m and “Iron Man 3” – 
£37.0m). The 53rd week benefited from the release of the final 
Hobbit film: “The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies”, which 
grossed £33.5m. The British film “Paddington” was also 
successful over the Christmas period grossing £28.0m.
Retail
Food and drink sales are the second most important source  
of revenue and represent 23.2% (2013: 22.9%) of Cineworld 
Cinemas’ total revenues. Total retail revenues were stronger  
at £89.3m (2013: £84.6m) and increased by 2.2% on a 52 v  
52 week basis.
Net retail spend per person increased by 6.3% in the period to 
£1.86 (2013: £1.75) partly due to the film mix, but also reflecting 
the expansion of Cineworld Cinemas’ retail offerings which 
targeted our mid-week customers and family visits to increase 
the overall spend.
During the year we opened a further two Starbucks coffee 
outlets, bringing the total to 13. All the outlets have traded in 
line with expectations and continue to grow their revenues. 
More openings are scheduled for 2015.
Other Income
Other Income includes all revenue streams other than box 
office and retail and represents 7.0% (2013: 6.3%) of total 
revenue. It increased to £27.0m (2013: £23.4m) and grew  
by 10.6% on a 52 v 52 week basis.
The largest single element of Other Income is screen 
advertising revenue. On a comparable year-on-year basis, 
screen advertising revenue has increased by 3.7%. Screen 
advertising revenue is collected through Digital Cinema Media 
Limited (“DCM”), our joint venture screen advertising business 
formed in July 2008. DCM’s primary function is to sell 
advertising time on cinema screens on behalf of Cineworld 
Cinemas, Picturehouse and its other clients. It also engages in 
related promotional work between advertisers and cinemas. 
The management team at DCM has been driving operational 
efficiencies and effectiveness and has been working on further 
exploiting the benefits of digital projection. DCM is now in a 
position to offer a greater number and a more diverse range  
of campaigns to its customers.

2014 was Picturehouse’s second full year as part of the  
Group. Acquired in December 2012 for £47.3m, Picturehouse  
is comprised of 19 cinemas focusing on a different audience 
from Cineworld Cinemas, with the cinemas being smaller  
(all have five or less screens) and more individual, and there being 
a greater emphasis on independent films and event cinema.
Overall, revenues for the period have increased by 6.0% on a 
year-on-year pro-forma basis. Box office revenue of £19.4m 
represents a 2.4% increase on the same basis reflecting a 
marginal decline in admissions and a 2.7% increase in average 
ticket price. As with Cineworld Cinemas, Picturehouse had a 
strong Christmas period, and the 53rd week accounted for an 
additional 3.5% increase in admissions.
Average spend per person performed in line with average 
ticket prices, resulting in an increase in retail revenue, despite 
the marginal decrease in admissions. Other Income increased 
by 17.0% (Other Income includes advertising income and 
screen-hire income).
Competition Commission
In October 2013, the Competition Commission published their 
decision on the acquisition of Picturehouse, resulting in the 
requirement to dispose of one cinema in each of Aberdeen, 
Bury St Edmunds and Cambridge. The process of disposing  
of a cinema in each of Aberdeen and Bury St was completed 
during 2014 and these sites are no longer part of the 
Picturehouse circuit. During the period the decision was  
taken to dispose of the Cineworld Cinemas site at Cambridge, 
which was completed on 29 January 2015. 20

On 10 January 2014, Cineworld Group plc announced the 
combination with the cinema business of Cinema City 
International N.V. (“CCI”), a leading cinema business in seven 
countries across CEE & Israel (“Cinema City”), by means of an 
acquisition of the shares in Cinema City Holding B.V. (“CCH”),  
a subsidiary of CCI. The combination with Cinema City 
completed on 28 February 2014 and has created the second 
largest cinema business in Europe (by number of screens).
The results of Cinema City for the 44 week period ended  
1 January 2015 are included in the Group’s consolidated 
performance and position for the period. The key revenue 
streams for Cinema City are consistent with the rest of the 
Group with the exception of distribution income.
The information below represents the pro-forma trading 
performance of Cinema City as if it had been part of the  
Group for the full 53 weeks. The information is presented  
on a constant currency basis with comparative information 
extracted from acquired management accounts.
Box Office
The principal income for Cinema City is box office revenue, 
which is a function of the number of admissions and the ticket 
price per admission, less sales tax. Admissions and box office 
revenue in CEE & Israel increased by 4.0% and 2.0% accordingly. 
Average ticket prices declined by 1.9%, predominantly influenced 
by the introduction of discounted Wednesdays in our Polish 
cinemas. As with the UK, Hollywood films are popular in CEE & 
Israel and “The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies” was one 
of the top three films in five of the seven CEE & Israel territories. 
Family films account for a higher proportion of admissions in the 
region and “How to Train Your Dragon 2” was also a top-three 
film in a number of territories.
Poland performed particularly strongly during the year with 
admissions growth of 6.8%. Local product is important to the 
cinema-going public in Poland, and this year saw the releases 
of Bogowie and Miasto 44, which were two of the top three 
movies in Poland during the year, compared to no local movies 
of this size in 2013. The popularity of discounted tickets offered 
on Wednesdays, which was introduced during the year, 
contributed to the increase in admissions, but also factored in 
the decrease in the average ticket price of 1.5% in Poland.
Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria all achieved varying levels of 
admissions and average ticket price growth. Most notable was 
Romania which achieved admission growth of 14.5% (12.9% on 
a same cinema basis). Israel, the Czech Republic and Slovakia 
were marginally down on admissions compared to 2013.
Retail
Food and drink sales to our customers are the second most 
significant source of revenue and represent 21.8% (2013: 21.2%) 
of Cinema City’s total revenues. Total retail revenues were 
stronger at £55.6m (2013: £48.1m), an increase of 4.7% on a 
comparative 52 v 52 week basis.
Retail spend per person increased by 0.8% during the period. 
The greatest increases were achieved in Hungary (8.9%), Czech 
Republic (3.9%) and Slovakia (3.7%). The increase in Hungary 
was driven by an annual price increase compounded by a 
reduction in the local rate of VAT. The Czech Republic and 
Slovakia both achieved higher than average increases due to 
efficiencies driven by local cinema teams. Spend per person 
was generally stable in the other territories, with a small decline 
in Poland due to the increase in customers taking advantage of 
discounted Wednesdays who tend to spend less overall.
Distribution Income 
The Forum Film brand is Cinema City’s film distribution 
business. Forum Film operates across the CEE & Israel region 
and distributes films on behalf of the major Hollywood studios 
as well as owning the distribution rights to certain independent 
movies. Distribution revenues decreased by 11.8% compared to 
the same period in 2014. The decline is due to the phasing of 
titles around the year end and as a result fewer titles were 
distributed in the first half of 2014 compared to the first half  
of 2013. The key titles distributed by Forum Film in the period 
were “The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies” (the benefit of 
which continued into the start of 2015) and “The Hunger Games: 
Mockingjay Part 1”, both released in the last quarter of 2014. 
Other Income 
Other income in respect of the cinema operations includes on 
and off-screen advertising. Other income also includes revenues 
generated by New Age Media which is Cinema City’s advertising 
and sponsorship arm. New Age Media offers on and off-screen 
advertising to not only Cinema City cinemas but other cinema 
chains in the region. Revenues in respect of New Age Media 
increased by 6.8% to £21.6m on a 52 week v 52 week pro-forma 
basis. As with DCM, New Age Media has benefited from the 
increased flexibility offered by digitalised cinema projection.

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report
Initiatives and Developments
Cinema Expansion
One of the key strategic priorities of the Group is expansion. 
We have the financial capability, through the cash generative 
nature of our business and our debt facility, to pursue  
such opportunities.
In the UK, we opened a six screen cinema in St Neots and new 
11 screen cinema in Telford. Our strong financial position and  
good track record of driving high footfalls through our cinemas 
make us an attractive partner for property developers. We have 
23 further development sites contractually scheduled to open 
in the next three years, ten of which are scheduled for opening 
in 2015 (including two Picturehouse sites) and are currently  
under construction.
In general, the territories in which Cinema City operates are 
underpenetrated and have lower annual admissions per capital 
than in typical Western European markets such as the UK. The 
Group believes that there is significant potential for growth in 
cinema admissions by opening new cinemas in under-screened 
locations and is looking to capitalise on this opportunity.
Cinema City has a strong track record of driving growth, having 
more than doubled its number of screens over the last eight 
years. Cinema City has a pipeline of 30 new multiplexes  
(328 screens) signed which are contractually scheduled  
to come on-stream over the next three years.
In April 2014 we opened a new six screen multiplex in Ploiesti, 
Romania, followed by Targu Jiu, Romania (also six screens) in 
October. Cinema City is currently contracted to open ten new 
sites (105 screens) during 2015, of which nine are currently 
under construction. 
Other Initiatives and Developments
As a Group, we are committed to ensuring our customers have 
the best possible experience when visiting our cinemas. The 
Cineworld estate is generally older than that of Cinema City, and 
a number of key sites have been identified for refurbishment to 
ensure our high standards are consistently maintained across 
our estate. During the second half of 2014, we started this 
programme with the redevelopment of our Milton Keynes 
cinema, with a further four scheduled during 2015.
Our Milton Keynes cinema now includes the UK’s first 4DX 
screen, an exciting new additional sensory cinema concept 
which has proved popular with Cinema City customers in other 
territories. The Milton Keynes site was relaunched in January 
2015. We look forward to continuing the expansion of this 
format in CEE & Israel, with a further four 4DX screens in the 
pipeline for 2015, and identifying further opportunities for  
4DX sites in the UK.
In addition to the introduction of 4DX, Cineworld Cinemas has 
continued to expand the IMAX format across a selection of our 
sites. The IMAX screens opened during 2013 have performed 
well during the current year and Cineworld Cinemas operates 
the nine IMAX screens successfully. During the first half of  
2014 we opened a further three IMAX screens in existing sites 
(Stevenage, Ashton-under-Lyne and Castleford) which were 
followed by a further two in the second half of the year 
(Cheltenham and Chichester). Our 15th IMAX was opened in 
our new cinema in Telford in August 2014. A further two IMAX 
screens will be included in new sites scheduled for opening in 
2015 (Broughton and Solihull NEC), with more in the pipeline. 
Cinema City successfully operates ten IMAX screens and is 
planning to open a further two during 2015.
The Cineworld Unlimited programme is one of the pillars that 
underpin our strategy of growing other revenues and admissions. 
The Unlimited programme brings to the Group the financial 
benefits of regular subscription income thereby reducing the 
level of fluctuation in our revenues. It also brings operational 
benefits by encouraging repeat visits, often at off-peak times. 
This, in turn, enables us to improve capacity utilisation at our 
cinemas and provide more retail opportunities.
Key Trends and Factors Potentially Affecting  
the Future
Availability of Appealing Films and the Impact on 
Box Office and Retail Revenues
The Group’s business and future success depends on the 
availability of films for screening in its cinemas and the appeal 
of such films to our customers. The Group’s box office revenue 
is driven by admissions (one of our key performance indicators), 
which depend on the number, timing and popularity of the films 
we are able to show in our cinemas. Admissions in turn drive the 
two other main revenues for the Group, which are retail revenue 
(the sale of food and drink for consumption within our cinemas) 
and screen advertising income (revenue from advertisements 
shown on our screens prior to feature presentations).
The film slate, including the timing of film releases, in any given 
period affects our ability to draw customers to our cinemas. 
The films available in any given period also affects box office 
revenue and average ticket prices through the mix of different 
ticket types sold. Certain films tend to attract an adult audience 
that will purchase higher-priced adult tickets, whereas other films 
are intended for children whose tickets are sold at a discount. 
Certain films are also more likely to be shown in premium 
formats such as 3D and/or IMAX, which command higher prices 
per ticket. Retail revenue is also impacted by the types and 
lengths of films shown and the exhibition format.
The film slate for 2015 looks promising and a number of films 
are expected to be blockbusters. Most notable releases include 
the next Bond film “Spectre”, the new Star Wars title “Star 
Wars: Episode VII”, “Avengers: Age of Ultron” and “Fifty Shades 
of Grey”. The final Hunger Games film “The Hunger Games: 
Mockingjay Part 2” and a further Fast and Furious title “Fast 
and Furious 7” which are also expected perform at least in line 
with their previous instalments. There is also a strong family 
film slate which includes “Minions”, “Inside Out” and “Big Hero 6”. 22
Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Digital Film and Technological Innovation
Technological innovation in the film exhibition industry has 
impacted both revenue and costs for the Group. All of our 
cinemas have now been converted to digital projection.  
The operating flexibility of digital projection technology has 
enhanced the capacity utilisation of the Group. Digital film 
content can be easily moved to and from auditoriums in our 
cinemas to maximise admissions. DCM and New Age Media  
can also offer shorter lead times and improved advertisement 
targeting to advertising customers.
As part of the Group’s move to digital projection, an agreement 
was entered into with the main Hollywood studios (via an agent 
where applicable) to recoup our investment in digital projection 
equipment by the Virtual Print Fee mechanism (“VPF”). VPFs 
are recognised on the date of the showing of the film it relates 
to and the rate of recognition depends on the number of 
screenings. The UK element of VPF income will start to decrease 
during 2015 and is expected to finish in early 2016, at which point 
the cost of the UK digital equipment will have been recouped.
Technical innovation has also allowed the Group to enhance 
the customer experience through premium formats such as 
IMAX, 3D and other large screen formats. The Group will also 
continue to provide additional sensory experiences to customers 
through 4DX and D-Box seating. The first 4DX cinema opened 
in 2015 with potential for further sites in the coming months. 
We are delighted to have provided this new technology to 
cinemagoers and look forward to the potential expansion  
of the service.
Appeal of Screen Advertising
The attractiveness of cinema screen advertising, as well as the 
demand for advertising generally, drives the Group’s revenue 
from DCM and New Age Media. Screen advertising revenue 
generally varies depending on the type of films screened, the 
minutes and value of advertising sold, the number of attendees 
who view the film, and the placement of the advertisement in 
relation to the start time of the film. Full digital conversion by all 
of DCM’s and New Age Media’s major clients has improved 
their competitive position and has enabled them to gain a 
larger share of advertising budgets, especially local retail which 
is a sector largely unexploited in cinema advertising, by 
offering greater flexibility and shorter lead times.
Expansion and Improvements
Customers choose to attend cinemas largely based on the 
state of their facilities and their locations. We maintain the 
quality of our offering by adding new screens, upgrades to 
seating concepts, expansion of food and drink offerings,  
and by disposing of older screens. The Group devotes a 
considerable amount of time assessing new site opportunities 
and this, along with further acquisitions, is a key part of our 
future growth strategy. Planning laws, economic environment, 
and the ability of developers to finance their projects where we 
may choose to locate our cinemas are some of the factors that 
may impact the Group’s development and growth initiatives. 
These characteristics differ by country.
The Picturehouse circuit provides an additional channel for 
expansion in the arthouse market under the Picturehouse 
brand and the existing pipeline of new multiplex cinemas is  
also increasing.

The following commentary on the profitability, cash flow and 
balance sheet focuses on the Cineworld Group including 
Cinema City and Picturehouse, except where stated.
EBITDA and Operating Profit
Group EBITDA was up 75.1% to £126.6m (2013: £72.3m) which 
reflects the inclusion of ten months of Cinema City.
EBITDA generated by the UK & Ireland was up 8.8% during the 
year at £78.8m (2013: £72.3m). The impact of the 53rd week 
equated to 5.8% of the EBITDA growth in the UK & Ireland. The 
EBITDA margin of 18.5% represented a 0.7 percentage point 
improvement from 2013. There have been savings across a 
number of direct cost lines, which were part offset by a small 
increase in concession cost of sales due to the increase in 
Starbucks as a proportion of total retail sales, which attracts a 
lower margin. Other cinema costs have remained in line with the 
prior period taking into account the impact of the 53rd week.
Chief Executive Officer’s Review
Continued 23
Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report
CEE & Israel generated EBITDA of £47.8m during the ten 
months it was part of the Group. On an annualised pro-forma 
basis, this represents growth of 13.8% (based on performance 
reported in the acquired management accounts). Pro-forma 
EBITDA margin of 24.4% represented a 2.7 percentage point 
improvement from 2013. Direct cost savings were consistent 
across CEE & Israel, and notably concession costs, as a 
percentage of retail sales, in CEE & Israel improved by 0.4 
percentage points. Other cinema costs have remained broadly 
in line with the previous year.
As the Group now operates in an additional seven territories,  
it has increased its exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. 
Wherever possible, cash income and expenditure is settled in 
local currency to mitigate exchange losses. However, there are 
translation exchange differences arising when presenting the 
year-on-year performance of Cinema City in the reporting 
currency of the Group. During the period for which Cinema 
City was part of the Group, EBITDA of £47.8m was £1.7m lower 
than it would have been had it been translated by applying the 
exchange rates at the start of the year.
Operating profit at £76.0m was 102.7% higher than the prior 
period (2013: £37.5m). Of the £76.0m, £27.6m related to Cinema 
City performance. Operating profit included a number of 
non-recurring and non-trade related items (please refer  
to Note 4 to the financial statements). Transaction and 
reorganisation costs of £6.9m included costs in respect of the 
combination with Cinema City totalling £5.5m (2013: £6.1m) 
and £1.4m related to other restructuring during the period.  
The net credit of £1.9m under onerous leases and other 
non-recurring charges comprised releases to onerous lease 
provisions due to changes in future trading assumptions of 
£4.5m, increases in our provision for dilapidations of £1.3m, 
£1.4m of other property related non-recurring charges and 
£0.1m profit on disposal of cinemas. An asset impairment 
review resulted in a £1.0m increase in asset values which is the 
net of a £1.3m impairment reversal on a previously loss making 
site which is now profitable and £0.3m asset write-downs at 
weaker performing cinemas.
The total depreciation and amortisation charge (included in 
administrative expenses) in the period totalled £46.3m. Of this, 
£23.3m related to depreciation in the UK & Ireland (which was 
consistent with the prior period when taking into account the 
53rd week) and £14.0m related to depreciation in CEE & Israel. 
Amortisation of £5.4m was incurred in respect of intangible 
assets recognised as part of the acquisition of Picturehouse in 
2012 and the combination with Cinema City at the start of 2014 
and amortisation of £3.9m was incurred in respect of acquired 
movie distribution rights.
Finance Costs
As part of the combination with Cinema City, the Group 
entered into a new five-year facility to finance the combination 
and repay the existing facility. An element of the new facility 
was drawn to part settle the acquisition cash consideration of 
£272m and €14.5m was drawn for the settlement of Cinema 
City’s existing debt facilities. The residual portion of the facility 
has been drawn to repay the existing facilities (in place during 
the 2013 comparative period) of the combined Group and to 
fund general working capital requirements going forward. The 
new facility provides funding of £400m of which £275m is a 
term loan and £125m is a revolving credit facility. £160m 
(€192m) of the new facility is available in Euros, reflecting the 
composition of the combined Group. This new financing 
arrangement became effective on 10 January 2014, but the new 
facility was not drawn and the existing facility was not repaid 
until 28 February 2014. As with the previous facility, the new 
facility is subject to floating interest rate charges. The new 
facility is subject to two covenants: the ratio of EBITDA to net 
debt and the ratio of EBITDAR (pre-rent EBITDA) to net finance 
charges. A margin, determined by the results of the covenant 
tests at a given date, is added to LIBOR. The margin on the 
term loan can range between 1.65% and 3.15% and the margin 
on the revolving credit facility can range between 1.40% and 
2.90%. At 1 January 2015, term debt totalled £275m and £44m 
of the £125m revolving credit facility was utilised. 
Since entering into the new facility management have 
evaluated the potential risk of a material impact arising from 
interest rate fluctuations and as a result have restructured  
the Group’s hedging arrangements to mitigate such risk.  
At 1 January 2015, the Group had six (2013: two) interest rate 
swaps which hedged 50% (2013: 65%) of the Group’s variable 
rate unsecured term loan. The two existing swaps relating to 
the old facility are now hedging the new facility together with 
four additional new swaps. Under IFRS quality, there is a 
requirement for the existing swaps to be reassessed to establish 
whether they still meet the criteria for hedge accounting. As 
such, the fair value of the two existing swaps at 28 February 
2014 previously recognised in other comprehensive income of 
£1.9m was recycled to the income statement as an exceptional 
finance expense as the fair value related to the hedging 
relationship with the old loan which was settled.
Net financing costs totalled £8.6m during the period  
(2013: £6.5m) which is a net increase of £2.1m. Finance income 
of £6.6m (2013: £0.3) included net foreign exchange gains of 
£6.0m (2013: £nil) on translation of the Euro term loan at the 
balance sheet date. £0.3m (2013: £0.1m) related to interest 
income and £0.3m (2013: £0.2m) related to finance income on 
assets held by defined benefit pension schemes.
Finance expense of £15.2m (2013: £6.8m) included £10.2m in 
respect of interest on bank loans and overdrafts (2013: £5.2m), 
with the increase being the result of the change in financing 
structure of the Group following the combination with Cinema 
City. Other net finance costs of £3.1m included amortisation of 
prepaid finance costs of £1.8m, £0.4m in respect of the unwind 
of discount and interest charges on property-related leases 
and £0.9m of other financial costs. 24

Taxation 
The overall tax charge during the year was £12.8m giving an 
overall effective tax rate of 19.0% (2013: 30.2%). The lower tax 
rate during the current period reflects the impact of the tax 
rates applicable in the different territories in which the Group 
now operates. The rate also reflects the impact of one-off 
disallowable expenditure (predominately acquisition costs) 
incurred during the period and the net impact in the current 
period of recognising deferred tax assets and liabilities at the 
lower future tax rate. The corporation tax charge in respect of 
the current year was £13.6m, resulting in a current year 
effective tax rate of 20.3% (2013: 35.2%). There was a credit of 
£0.1m relating to prior years, which was offset by £0.8m 
deferred tax charges principally relating to capital allowances 
(the difference between the tax written down value of the capital 
allowance and the net book value of the underlying assets).
Earnings
Profit on ordinary activities after tax in the period was £54.5m, 
compared to the comparative period (2013: £21.0m). The 
significant increase is attributable to the acquisition of Cinema 
City and ten months profit generated from its inclusion in the 
Group. Basic earnings per share amounted to 22.1p (2013: 14.0p). 
Eliminating the one-off, non-trade related items described 
above (totalling £9.4m within operating profit, exceptional 
finance charges of £2.6m and net foreign exchange gains  
of £4.3m), adjusted diluted earnings per share were 24.4p 
(2013: 18.6p). Following the business combination with Cinema 
City, the Group has taken the opportunity to consider how it 
presents its adjusted earnings per share calculation. After a 
review of comparable UK Premium Listed companies, a 
decision was made to no-longer add back the charge for 
share-based payments as it is considered to be an ongoing 
cost of remunerating staff (please refer to Note 5).
Cash Flow and Balance Sheet
Overall, net assets have increased by £312.4m, to £506.3m 
since 26 December 2013. This includes the recognition of the 
fair value of net assets acquired with Cinema City totalling 
£174.2m, the residual goodwill recognised on acquisition of 
£336.4m and the increase in net debt as a result of the 
combination of £169.6m as well as other movements in net 
assets totalling £28.6m.
Acquisition of Cinema City
On 10 January 2014, Cineworld Group plc announced the 
proposed combination with the cinema business of Cinema 
City International N.V. (“CCI”), by means of an acquisition of the 
shares in Cinema City Holding B.V. (“CCH”), a subsidiary of CCI. 
At the date of the announcement, the headline consideration 
for the combination equated to £503m in cash and shares and 
€14.5m for the settlement of CCH bank debt. The combination 
was completed on 28 February 2014, at which point 
adjustments for certain provisions of the purchase agreement 
resulted in a fair value of considered transferred of £510.6m. 
Final cash consideration of £302.6m was part funded by an  
8 for 25 Rights Issue which completed on 14 February 2014, 
raising net funds of £107.2m with the residual cash consideration 
being funded from the Group’s new debt facility. The Group 
issued to CCI shares in Cineworld Group plc which were valued 
at £208.0m when the combination completed on 28 February 
2014. The consideration shares represented 24.9% of the 
post-rights issue share capital of the Group.
As noted above, the fair value of net assets acquired with 
Cinema City totalled £174.2m. In the June 2014 Interim Report, 
the fair values of the acquired net assets were presented on  
a provisional basis. Management have now finalised the 
allocation of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities 
and as a result goodwill of £336.3m has been recognised 
compared to the £335.6m recognised in June 2014. The 
change of £0.8m related to valuation of property, plant and 
equipment, leases and deferred tax assets (please refer to  
Note 9). There was no change in value of the previously 
unrecognised identifiable intangible assets totalling £46.1m. 
The residual goodwill of £336.4m still represents the skills and 
industry knowledge of Cinema City’s management and 
workforce, synergies expected to be realised post acquisition 
and the future value expected to be generated by the Group 
from Cinema City’s pipeline of new sites and ability to enter 
new territories.
At the time of announcing the combination, synergies 
identified totalled £2.0m. This amount has been successfully 
achieved since acquisition on an annualised basis. Management 
are now confident that annualised synergies of £5.0m can be 
achieved over the next three years.
Cash Flow and Net Debt
The Group continued to be cash generative at the operating 
level. Total net cash generated from operations in the year was 
£86.1m (2013: £55.6m). The increase in cash generated from 
operations reflects the inclusion of the results of Cinema City 
since 28 February 2014.
Net cash spent on capital during the year was £48.1m, which is 
net of reverse premiums received of £1.5m. Included in this 
expenditure was £21.9m in relation to the development of new 
sites, £18.7m in respect of maintenance and £7.5m on other 
revenue-generating initiatives.

Cineworld Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014
Financial Statements Governance Strategic Report
Net debt increased to £281.9m at the end of the current year 
compared to the prior year (2013: £112.3m). The significant 
movement was due to the change in finance structure of the 
enlarged Group. The net increase in bank loans and overdrafts 
in the period was £186.5m, this was part offset by the cash 
acquired with Cinema City of £24.1m. Net debt at the period 
end represented 2.1 times the rolling 12 month EBITDA figure 
for the combined Group (on a pro-forma basis).
Dividends
The Directors are recommending to shareholders for approval 
a final dividend in respect of the period ended 1 January 2015 
of 9.7p per share, which taken together with the interim 
dividend of 3.8p per share paid in October 2014 equates to a 
total dividend in respect of 2014 of 13.5p per share (2013: 10.1p 
per share). The total 2013 dividend per share includes a 
rights-adjusted interim dividend of 3.7p per share. This 2013 
interim dividend per share has been adjusted to take account 
of the rights issue of 8 for 25 shares on 14 February 2014, in 
order to present a comparator for the 2014 dividend. The 2013 
interim dividend as previously reported was 4.1p per share. On 
this basis, the 2014 dividend of 13.5p per share represents an 
increase of 33.7%. The record date for the dividend is 12 June 
2015 and the payment date is 9 July 2015. Cineworld has 
increased its dividend every year since the Company was listed 
in 2007.
Board Changes
On completion of the combination with Cinema City, Moshe 
(Mooky) Greidinger (former Chief Executive Office of CCI) and 
Israel Greidinger (former Chief Financial Officer) of CCI joined 
the Board of Cineworld Group plc as Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Operating Officer respectively. At the same time 
Mooky Greidinger and Israel Greidinger stepped down from 
their executive positions on the Board of CCI (now Global City 
Holdings N.V. (“GCH”). Given the investment in Cineworld 
Group plc held by GCH a relationship agreement was put in 
place to govern the key operational arrangements between the 
related parties. This agreement gives GCH the right to appoint 
a Non-Executive Director to the Board.
On 20 November 2013, the Group announced the resignation 
of Stephen Wiener, Cineworld’s founder and CEO, and he left 
the employment of the Group on 31 March 2014, stepping down 
from his role as CEO and as a Director of the Company on 
completion of the combination with Cinema City. At this time, 
Scott Rosenblum and Arni Samuelsson joined the Board as 
Non-Executive Directors. Scott Rosenblum was appointed  
by GCH in accordance with the relationship agreement. On  
6 August 2014 it was announced that Israel Greidinger’s role 
would change from Chief Operating Officer to Deputy Chief 
Executive Officer.
Following nine years of committed service, David Maloney  
and Peter Williams will lose their independent status as 
Non-Executive Directors and will step down from the Board at 
the next AGM. Julie Southern has been invited to join the Board 
as a Non-Executive Director, and will stand for election at the 
AGM. It is intended that Julie Southern will succeed David 
Maloney as the Chair of the Audit Committee and that Martina 
King will succeed Peter Williams as Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee. A further appointment to the Board is anticipated 
and the revised composition of the respective Board 
Committees will be announced in due course.

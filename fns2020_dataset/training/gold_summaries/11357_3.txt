 3 Annual report 2012
Dear shareholder
I am pleased to present the annual report and accounts of Nostra Terra Oil and Gas Company plc for
the year ended 31 December 2012. This was a successful year for Nostra Terra. We continued to
implement our growth strategy, expanding both our asset base and our production.
Exploration & production highlights
A key development in 2012 was our acquisition of a 20% interest in the Chisholm Trail Prospect. The
first four wells have all exceeded our expectations, contributing to greater revenues for Nostra Terra
and helping us to pass breakeven on an operational basis in January 2013. A horizontal well in the
Warrior Prospect began producing in the first half of the year and a well at the Bale Creek Prospect
was producing oil and generating revenue by November. The initial Verde well has exceeded our
expectations, reaching payout within nine months. In March 2013, we purchased a 5% working interest
(“WI”) in the High Plains Prospect in Texas, which we have since increased to 20%. High Plains gives
us a higher-risk exploration opportunity, with large upside potential. We are now identifying potential
drill targets and expect to have multiple prospect areas.
Financial highlights
Growth in production led to higher revenues, which increased from £244,000 in 2011 to £352,000 in
2012, a rise of 44%. We achieved a gross profit of £90,000, compared with a loss of £126,000 in the
previous year. As the company grows we keep tight control of administrative expenses, which decreased
by  6% to £876,000. This contributed to a reduced loss before tax of £840,000, against a loss of
£996,000 in 2011.
I am pleased to report that as we moved into 2013 production increased significantly, enabling us to
achieve break even on an operational basis. We were also successful with our litigation with Richfield
leading to a judgment, enabling us to begin collection.
Summary
Nostra Terra made strong progress in 2012. We are encouraged by the start we have made to 2013
and believe we are well positioned to achieve further success. I would like to thank our executive
directors, Matt Lofgran and Alden McCall, for their considerable achievements and their hard work,
which includes significant analysis of the many opportunities they decided not to pursue. I also wish to
thank Nostra Terra’s shareholders for their continuing loyalty. We look forward to keeping you informed
about our progress.

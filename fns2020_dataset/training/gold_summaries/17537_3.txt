2009 was a year of significant change at YCO Group.
a gainst a background of challenging market conditions, 
the Board undertook an extensive restructuring 
programme resulting in an integrated business with a 
strengthened service offering. t he restructuring will also 
enable the Group to expand the business effectively,  
as appropriate, as market conditions improve.
Significant savings have also been made in operational 
overheads and the turnaround has resulted in a maiden 
profit being reported for the year. t he Board expects 
that the full benefits of these savings will be gained  
during 2010.
t he Board is satisfied that the businesses throughout  
the Group are now managed more efficiently in terms  
of both costs and operations. However, efforts are 
ongoing to further improve the Group’s efficiency and  
to reduce its cost base, in addition to strengthening  
the service offering and to continue to keep the Group 
moving ahead in its marketplace.
l ed by our new CEO, Charlie Birkett and YCO Managing 
partner and YCO Group Executive d irector Gary 
w right, who are both very experienced in the  
superyacht industry, the outlook for 2010 is encouraging 
as the world emerges from a challenging economic 
climate. w e are witnessing signs of a gradual recovery, 
from which we expect the luxury travel and tourism 
market to benefit.
I would like to thank my fellow Board members and all 
the Group’s employees for their support and hard  
work in achieving the Group’s impressive turnaround. 
w ith an enhanced starting position for 2010, improved 
operations and an established philosophy of corporate 
control and responsibility, we approach the year ahead 
with enthusiasm and optimism.

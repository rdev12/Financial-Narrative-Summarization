CLIENT STORY
Bulk supplies of empty bottles arrive 
at A&S Packaging in Dumbarton 
to be filled with whisky.
Many of our products are used in transit packaging 
where their primary function is to stabilise loads for 
safe transportation. 
Our pallet covers have to be light, but very strong to
ensure that heavy and potentially dangerous loads, 
such as bottles and building materials, are moved 
around cleanly and securely without being damaged 
or causing injury. 
04 Report by Directors & Business Review
BPI-001 ANNUAL REPORT.qxp  20/4/07  09:20  Page 4 Over the last few years the introduction of new
polymer technology and extrusion equipment has
resulted in significant reductions in film thickness
across all traditional pallet protection films. This,
coupled with the development of stretch hood film
as a replacement for traditional shrink films, means
that end users can reduce their film usage by as
much as 30% whilst also eliminating the energy
required to shrink the film.
Much of the used pallet protection film is collected
and baled at distribution centres and other points
along the delivery chain. BPI takes back over 35,000
tonnes per annum for recycling and conversion into
other film products.

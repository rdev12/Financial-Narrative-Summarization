Review
Principal corporate objectives
achieve double digit growth in adjusted EpS over 
the business cycle
Adjusted earnings per share (“EPS”), measured over the 
business cycle, provides an absolute benchmark of the 
Company’s performance. Over the last five years, adjusted 
EPS has grown at a compound growth rate of 17% p.a. 
through a combination of steady organic growth and 
carefully targeted acquisitions.
Generate TSR growth in the upper quartile of the FTSE 250 
Total shareholder return (“TSR”) is the growth in value of a 
share plus the value of dividends reinvested in the Company’s 
shares on the day on which they are paid. This is measured 
against the TSR growth of the FTSE mid-250 index (excluding 
investment trusts) (“FTSE 250”). The last five years have seen 
a compound TSR growth for Diploma of 39% p.a., which 
represents upper quartile performance as compared with 
the FTSE 250, where median TSR growth has been 18% p.a. 
Deliver progressive dividend growth with two times 
dividend cover
Diploma follows a progressive dividend policy with a target 
cover of two times on an adjusted EPS basis. Over the last five 
years, dividends have steadily grown at the rate of 16% p.a. and 
this continues the trend of increasing dividends in each of the 
last 14 years. 
“ Over five years, compound 
growth rates for adjusted EPS 
and TSR have been 17% p.a. 
and 39% p.a. respectively.” 09 Strategic Report

businesses in achieving superior margins by offering strongly 
differentiated products and customer focused solutions, 
as well as by running efficient operations. 
Underlying revenue is after adjusting for the impact from 
acquisitions and divestments and for currency movements 
on the translation of overseas results.

fixed assets.

Arden has performed satisfactorily despite poor markets. We 
continue to capitalise on and expand our relationship broking 
model, aiming to grow further from our already strong base. 
We have generated cash as well as making a profit such that 
our cash at the year end was £9.5 million, putting Arden in 
a strong position to grow our franchise at an opportunistic 
time. 
Earnings for the year to October 2008 are, as with other 
UK brokers, below earnings in 2007. Current conditions do 
however present opportunities for our business to grow its 
franchise. The withdrawal of many investment banks from the 
small and mid cap markets is no doubt an opportunity for 
Arden, which has both the people and the capacity to reap 
benefits from the downturn. 
We are now able to hire high-calibre staff at considerably 
lower cost than was the case twelve months ago. To this 
end we have during the course of the year hired eleven 
senior staff, with a further five joining in the two months 
since our October year end. In 2008 we also expanded our 
sector coverage, adding financials, electronics and electrical 
equipment, and healthcare.
It is the Board’s view that the current markets must represent 
an opportunity rather than a threat, given the strength of our 
balance sheet.
Trading since October has remained difficult but we are on a 
sound footing with a strong balance sheet and a pipeline of 
new business that is creditable given difficult markets. The 
Board has decided to retain cash for building the platform, 
and has therefore not declared a final dividend.
Finally, I would like to thank all concerned for their contribution 
in these very challenging times.

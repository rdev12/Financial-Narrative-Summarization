Nostrum at a glance
Overview
Who we are
Nostrum Oil & Gas PLC is an 
independent oil and gas 
company engaging in the 
production, development and 
exploration of oil and gas in 
the pre-Caspian Basin.
We are a simple, sustainable 
and successful organisation 
with the vision to become the 
leading independent oil and 
gas exploration and production 
company in the Former Soviet 
Union (FSU). 
We recognise that our financial 
and operational targets need  
to be pursued in a responsible 
way and we believe that our 
track record clearly demonstrates 
the successful achievement of 
our strategic goals. 
Whilst we continue to make 
progress towards our financial 
and operational goals, we have 
developed a simple strategy 
that will allow us to successfully 
deliver the near term growth 
we have targeted, combined 
with long term, sustainable 
value creation.
What we do
We focus on creating long term 
shareholder value through the 
development and discovery of 
oil and gas reserves, as well as 
the production and sale of 
crude oil, stabilised condensate, 
LPG and dry gas. Our highly 
skilled management team has 
managed the investment of 
over US$1.5 billion in our 
licence area since 2004, 
delivering on a number of 
infrastructure projects as well 
as significantly expanding the 
reserve base over the last ten 
years through our own 
appraisal work, as well as 
successful M&A activity.
Our commercial 
products
Our range of products at 
Nostrum are crude oil, 
stabilised liquid condensate, 
LPG and dry gas. Currently all 
our production comes from 
the Chinarevskoye licence. 
We have invested in developing 
our own infrastructure to 
control the transportation of 
our products until they reach 
the final off-taker, which serves 
a wide network of destinations 
and off-takers, helping to 
ensure we always obtain the 
best possible prices.

Average daily 
production rates
We have increased production 
every year from 2004–2013 when 
full capacity of our processing 
facilities was achieved. The 2014 
production from the Chinarevskoye 
licence of 44,400 boepd will remain 
broadly steady for 2015 and only 
represents half of what we are 
aiming to achieve from the field. 
We are currently working to 
increase our processing capacity, 
allowing us to more than double 
production. 
Market positioning
We are in a unique position in the 
market, with our front-loaded 
investment programme meaning 
we are now a leader in terms of 
infrastructure in the region, with 
the ability to process significant 
volumes of raw gas via our gas 
treatment facility. In addition, 
our advantageous location in 
north-west Kazakhstan places 
us closer to our final off-take 
destinations, such as the Black Sea 
ports and Finland.
Operational structure
Nostrum has a simple and  
familiar operating structure.  
It has a board of directors led  
by the chairman and a senior 
management team led by the 
CEO. Nostrum aims to keep its 
operating structure as simple  
as possible to reflect its simple 
investment case. The senior 
management team manages the 
major units involved in operations 
according to the interaction chart 
on page 58.

 Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 06
Overview
Jonathan Bloomer
Chairman
5 March 2015 Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2014 07
Overview
Against a backdrop of increased regulation, 
we expect the trend for market 
consolidation to continue, with a smaller 
number of large, highly compliant 
providers emerging.
Arrow Global has been a FTSE-listed 
company for a little over a year and has 
settled into life as a PLC very successfully, 
having paid its maiden interim dividend 
and proposed a final dividend of 3.4p 
bringing the total full-year dividend to 5.1p.
Our achievements this year couldn’t 
have been delivered without the hard work 
of my fellow directors, the Group’s 
executive committee and colleagues from 
across the business as a whole.
We continue to refresh the composition 
of the board to ensure that it is best placed 
to operate effectively. On the retirement 
of Gillian Key-Vice from the board on  
27 November 2014, we announced that we 
were seeking a replacement. We were 
delighted to announce on 3 March 2015 the 
appointment of Lan Tu as a non-executive 
director with effect from 9 March 2015. 
Her strong financial and commercial 
pedigree, especially in the area of regulated 
financial services within Europe, will 
enable her to make a strong contribution 
to the Group and will complement the 
existing experience of the board.
As a board of directors, we remain 
firmly committed to serving customers 
and creditors, and have a very strong 
focus on treating customers fairly, which 
is also a key pillar of the Financial Conduct 
Authority’s (FCA’s) oversight regime.
Our landing slot for full FCA 
authorisation is Q3 2015. This is an 
important date for us and a key deliverable 
for the business this year. As part of our 
preparations, we have embedded  
our three lines of defence model and, in  
April 2014, formally appointed BDO as 
internal auditors. 
Having reviewed the information  
in this report, my fellow directors and  
I confirm that the annual report and 
accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable, and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the performance, strategy  
and business model of the company.
We look forward to a successful 2015, 
where we will continue to deliver for 
customers and shareholders alike, and hope 
to see many of you at our annual general 
meeting on 3 June 2015 in Manchester.
Chairman’s statement
2014 was another transformational year for  
Arrow Global Group PLC, perhaps most notably 
because of the acquisition of Capquest, following 
resounding shareholder approval at our general 
meeting in November. As part of the acquisition, 
we successfully raised €225 million through the 
issue of senior secured notes.
Our landing slot for  
full FCA authorisation  
is Q3 2015. This is an 
important date for us  
and a key deliverable  
for the business this year.

Annual report and financial statements 2015
Strategic highlights
The investment made to modernise 
and expand the capacity of our 
Huntingdon site in the UK, to service 
increased volumes for Tesco, was 
completed during 2015. The new 
production facilities are now fully 
bedded in, working well and delivering 
the planned operational efficiencies.
The progress of the joint venture with 
Woolworths in Australia continues to 
be encouraging. A new dedicated retail 
packed meat facility, near Melbourne, 
operated by the joint venture company, 
commenced production on schedule 
in September 2015, with the store 
roll out plan covering Victoria and 
South Australia now completed.
Operating highlights
Volume growth of 5.5%, with growth 
in the UK, Ireland and Holland for 
Tesco and Albert Heijn with particularly 
strong Christmas trading, partly offset 
by continuing pressure on consumer 
spending in Denmark.
Revenue reduced by 0.4% despite 
the volume gains, reflecting the 
strengthening of Sterling, which 
decreased revenue by 7.4%.
Operating profit at £29.0m 11.3% ahead 
of last year (2014: £26.1m) and 20.9% 
higher on a constant currency basis.
Investment expenditure returning 
to maintenance levels at £13.7m 
(2014: £43.3m), following completion of 
the major re-investment programmes 
undertaken in the UK and Sweden.
A free cash inflow of £31.7m (compared 
to an outflow of £2.1m in 2014) 
generating net cash balances of £12.7m 
at the year end, as compared with net 
debt of £7.7m at end of 2014.
A strong ungeared balance sheet 
providing a firm platform for 
future expansion.

 2 Christie Group Annual Report 2012
“UK purchasers were funded by
a total of 21 different sources
compar ed with just four in 2008. ”
I am pleased to report that the Group revenue was £56.1m for
2012, an increase of 5.4% on the prior year (2011: £53.3m).
Operating profits achieved before exceptional items amounted
to £1.4m, a significant increase from the prior year (2011:
£0.7m). Operating profit after exceptional items amounted to
£0.6m (2011: £0.3m). The disruption to normal trading patterns
which I referred to at the time of my interim statement in
September resulted in a particularly slow third quarter .
Operating losses of £0.8m (2011: £0.4m) were incurred by our Dubai operation,
which we took the decision to close shortly before the year-end and have
classified as an exceptional item accordingly.
Professional Business Services
Professional Business Services revenues were £30.4m, some £3m higher than
in 2011 (£27.4m). Operating profit before exceptional items amounted to £0.6m,
a material improvement from the previous year’s operating loss before
exceptional items of £0.1m.
During the year, our UK purchasers were funded by a total of 21 different
sources. This compares markedly with 2008 when the finance arrangements
that we brokered principally came from just four sources of finance, giving
some appreciation of the increasing availability of funds.
The Spring Uprising and problems in Libya and Syria were unforeseen at the
time of our opening in Dubai. These events had a profound impact on early
prospects for us in the region and hence our decision to withdraw. We will
continue to service consultancy projects in the Middle East from our other
international offices.
Elsewhere, our international operations made excellent progress. During the
year we commenced new operations in Ireland and in Poland. Both these
markets are showing an early appreciation of the services we offer .
I’m delighted to advise that our transactional and consulting practice,
Christie + Co, has for the third year running, won the EGi Deals Award as the
‘UK’s most active agent’ in the Leisure and Hotels category throughout the
provincial mainland of the UK.

Stock & Inventory Systems & Services
Given the headline collapses in the UK high street retail
sector, holding revenue at £25.7m against the prior year of
£25.9m was a credible achievement. Operating profit was
increased to £0.8m (2011: £0.6m). Our licensed stocktaking
business continues to recruit and train new stocktakers.
After stocktaking for the summer’s Olympics, the scale of
our capability is unquestioned. We have continued to win new
clients including Charles Wells, Punch Taverns, River Island
and Space NK.
Our retail stocktaking operation signed its first franchise,
which has proved a catalyst for us developing a stand-alone
IT and support system. This new capability provides a method
of more rapid expansion for us which we are currently
focusing on Continental Europe.
Outlook
Whilst our expectation that the number of distressed sales
would slow has proven accurate, we similarly anticipate that
the continued demand for businesses will lead to the advent
of willing vendor instructions. Inevitably there is some dip in
market volumes during this crossover period.
Our leisure agency and advisory business activity has been
hit by the recent and unexpected liquidation by the Irish
government of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (“IBRC”)
by whom we were engaged. These factors resulted in a quiet
period for completed transactions in the first quarter within
our PBS division. We are seeing larger company and debt
sales in the market which should benefit both our advisory
and transactional asset businesses this year .

The stocktaking division has enjoyed a good start to 2013
with further new demand for our services, particularly in
mainland Europe.
Christie Group relies on the support of its clients and the
continuing commitment and professionalism of its quality
personnel. It is thanks to them both that we continue to hold
our strong market position.
Your Board proposes a maintained final dividend of 0.5p per

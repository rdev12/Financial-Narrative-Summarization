I am delighted to be reporting on a year in which the Displays 
business has achieved so much. The business has been 
transformed over the last 5 years and is placed very strongly in 
the markets in which it operates. It has also given the business 
the opportunity to explore new geographical locations, promote 
different types of displays and invest in the development of 
intellectual property. All these components combined with the 
core business mean that the Group can move forward again 
from the position that it has already achieved. 
Performance for the year
The results of the underlying business for the year reflect the 
progress that has been made in all areas of the business. 
Revenues increased by 11% from £20.8 million in 2010 to £23.1 
million in 2011 and gross profit by 19% from £5.8 million in 2010 
to £6.9 million in 2011. This reflects the work that has been 
done strengthening the product portfolio available to the Group 
and the quality of the business being conducted. The gross 
margin percentage increased from 28.1% in 2010 to 29.6% 
in 2011, which reflected the mix of business being conducted 
during the year.
Orders booked during the year fell by 3% from £21.8 million 
in 2010 to £21.2 million in 2011. During 2010 last time buy 
orders were received for products that had become end of life 
and were being discontinued by suppliers and these orders 
amounted to approximately £0.5 million. Excluding these orders, 
the orders booked in 2011 were in line with the previous year. It 
was disappointing that we did not grow the orderbook during 
the year but certain orders that were forecast to be received 
during December were delayed until the beginning of 2012. 
Orders booked in the first quarter of 2012 are in excess of 28% 
higher than in the same period during 2011 which gives a good 
indication that the business is on track to continue to grow 
during 2012.
Regional review
European business — the European region is made up of 
four subsidiaries, two local offices and a number of distributors 
located throughout Europe and in other key locations.
Densitron Europe Ltd is the Group’s UK subsidiary responsible 
for sales in the UK, management of offices in Italy and India, 
management of the Group’s distribution network, providing 
support to other European subsidiaries and direct sales to other 
regions where the Group does not have a physical presence.
During 2011 the revenues increased by 15% from £5.3 million 
in 2010 to £6.1 million in 2011 while gross profit increased by 
19% from £1.6 million in 2010 to £1.9 million in 2011. Order 
intake increased by 6% from £5.1 million in 2010 to £5.4 million 
in 2011. Keeping control of administrative and finance expenses 
resulted in an increase in profit before tax from £117,000 in 
2010 to £338,000 in 2011.
We have previously reported that we have opened an office in 
Italy and during 2011 this decision began to be justified with 
several projects beginning production. India has been a location 
that we have been addressing through distributors for a number 
of years but with the number of enquiries that we receive on a 
monthly basis and the ongoing economic growth in India we 
considered that it would be more appropriately served through 
our own people on the ground. To that end we opened an office 
in India in January 2012 and are already seeing exciting new 
opportunities that will be pursued during the year.
France performed well in the year growing revenues by 46% 
from £2.4 million in 2010 to £3.5 million in 2011 and significantly 
increasing operating profits. In Germany revenues declined by 
21% from £2.9 million in 2010 to £2.3 million in 2011, however, 
revenues in 2011 were at a higher gross margin which resulted 
in an increase in operating profit. The main reason for the 
reduction in revenues was due to two major customers carrying 
stock from 2010 and not placing new orders for delivery during 
2011. They have now reduced the stock levels that they were 
holding and have placed orders at the beginning of 2012 for 
Chief Executive Officer’s Review
The results of the underlying business reflects the 
progress that has been made in all areas of the business.

delivery during the year. I reported last year that Finland had 
experienced a difficult year and that new products had been 
introduced into the market. The product introductions have 
taken longer than expected to have an impact and during 2011 
revenues declined further from £0.6 million to £0.5 million but 
due to control of administrative expenses the loss experienced 
for the year was minimal. We saw that activity and opportunities 
grew through 2011 and we are now seeing a significant 
improvement in orders being booked which should result in 
sales during 2012.
US business — The US business continued to perform 
extremely well with revenues increasing 15% from £6.8 million 
in 2010 to £7.8 million in 2011 and operating profits increasing 
35% from £572,000 in 2010 to £774,000 in 2011. 
I reported last year that the US business was important for 
the rest of the Group, with the introduction of new products. 
It has continued to develop new products that will benefit the 
Group in the second half of 2012 and beyond. Additionally 
Brazil has been identified as a location where the Group has 
an opportunity to conduct business and to this end the US 
business is carrying out a controlled entry into the Brazilian 
market in the early part of 2012.
In 2011 the US business played a major part in moving the 
Group forward and that will continue into the future. The US 
business is managed by Greg Hayes and I would like to thank 
him and his team for the work that they have done, not only in 
growing the US business, but also for the product development 
that benefits the Group as a whole. Despite the fact that Greg 
has decided to step down from his position as a main Board 
member he will remain as President of the US business and is 
committed to the strategy in place for the US business and the 
Group as a whole.
Asian business — The Asian business is made up of the 
Group’s subsidiary located in Japan selling display products 
into the Japanese market and a subsidiary that is located in 
Taiwan that acts as a facilitator to the Group for products that 
are sourced and manufactured in Taiwan and mainland China. It 
also has a limited amount of sales into the Taiwanese domestic 
market.
Japan continued with the success that it achieved in 2010, 
growing revenues by 26% from £1.9 million in 2010 to £2.4 
million in 2011. It also increased its profit from operations from 
£113,000 in 2010 to £307,000 in 2011, an increase of 172%. 
It is important to understand this achievement in context; our 
Japanese subsidiary is selling Chinese and Taiwanese displays 
into a market that is renowned for its locally manufactured high 
quality displays. The team located in Japan is very experienced 
and should be congratulated for the tremendous result that they 
achieved in 2011 particularly in light of the difficulties that they 
experienced following the earthquake and subsequent tsunami 
that hit Japan in March 2011.
Densitron Display Taiwan Limited provides the Group with 
a support operation that provides project management, 
engineering support and supplier relationship services to the 
rest of the Group. It also provides some direct sales into the 
Taiwanese market. In the current year revenues fell by 44% from 
£0.9 million in 2010 to £0.5 million in 2011 but the gross profit 
on this revenue increased by 20% from £88,000 in 2010 to 
£106,000 in 2011.

Chief Executive Officer’s Review continued
Outlook and future strategy
Over the last few years we have re-established the name of 
Densitron as a leading brand in the provision of industrial display 
solutions. The key focus for the future is to build on this but we 
also recognise that in the near term the opportunity to grow 
organically through increased market share will diminish. We 
believe that the existing strategy of the Company remains sound 
but also believe that it is important that we develop additional 
solutions in order to drive the business forward. We will continue 
with the existing strategy of: 
 ❙ Increasing market share from the existing business — we 
consider that all of the subsidiaries have the ability to 
continue to grow market share and that several are yet to 
achieve the level of market share that we would expect from 
them;
 ❙ Geographical expansion of the business — in 2012 we 
have opened an office in India which we consider to be 
a tremendous opportunity and we will be carrying out a 
controlled entry into the Brazilian market; and
 ❙ Introduction of new products to the current product offerings 
— during 2011 we introduced e-paper and have received a 
good level of enquiries and are currently working on some 
exciting opportunities. We will continue to introduce new 
product offerings that we consider will enhance the Group’s 
portfolio of products.
We have added a further element to the strategy that we believe 
will enable the Group to move to another level. 
 ❙ Creation of more value by development of the Group’s 
own products and intellectual property — in order to 
keep existing customers and attract new customers it is 
important that the Group offers something different from 
its competitors. In order to do this the Group is creating its 
own intellectual property and bespoke range of products 
and these will be available to the market later in 2012. By 
listening to what our customers are trying to achieve with 
their business we believe we will be better positioned to 
target our product offerings in the most appropriate direction 
in order to service their needs. The projects that are currently 
being worked on are exciting and I look forward to being 
able to give further information to shareholders on them.
I would like to congratulate and thank all of the staff within 
Densitron for their hard work and dedication to the Group during 
the year and look forward to the business progressing further in 
the forthcoming year.

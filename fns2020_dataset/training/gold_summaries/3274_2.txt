“The financial year to 31 March 2011 marked a turning point for Chamberlin, 
with the Company returning to profit and recommencing the payment of 
dividends. Demand recovered throughout the year and the final quarter saw 
volumes at the Group’s Walsall and Scunthorpe foundries match or exceed 
pre-recession levels. Production at Chamberlin’s third foundry at Leicester 
was at 85% of pre-recession levels but volumes are continuing to build.
Chamberlin is well positioned for growth, helped by the modernisation 
and investment programme completed prior to recession and we expect 
the Group to make progress over the financial year. With demand for our 
products linked to global engineering activity, we see powerful long term 
trends favouring our business.”

Business review
Progress during 2009
■
 Although skilled personnel remain in unprecedented demand, 
we have been successful in accessing international labour 
markets, including through graduate recruitment, in particular 
in the Middle East, the Indian Subcontinent and Asia Pacific
■
 We have grown our headcount from approximately 11,100 at 
December 2008 to approximately 11,700 at December 2009
■
 We have seen significant growth in our largest reporting 
segment, Engineering & Construction, where employee 
numbers have grown from 3,400 to 4,200
■
 Furthermore, our Engineering & Construction reporting 
segment is supported by our Engineering Services’ offices  
in Mumbai and Chennai, where we have recently moved  
into larger premises and now have around 1,300 employees 
(2008: 1,000)
■
 We have further widened our employee share ownership,  
and now have around 3,000 employee shareholders 
(representing around 28% of the eligible workforce)
■
 As the group has grown during the year, we have broadened 
and strengthened our senior management team with the 
addition of further high calibre personnel, such as a new  
Group Treasurer, Group Head of Tax and Construction Director
Future milestones
■
 In order to support our growth plans, we expect to further 
broaden and strengthen our senior management team
■
 We plan to continue to increase headcount, particularly in 
Engineering & Construction, through growing our existing 
operational centres, developing our joint venture offices,  
such as in Jakarta and Abu Dhabi, and establishing  
in-country engineering offices, for example, in Saudi Arabia
Progress during 2009
■
 Caltec Limited and Eclipse Petroleum Technology Limited  
were acquired in 2008. Since January 2009, these businesses 
have been grouped with our other consultancy businesses 
within Production Solutions. While, like the majority of our 
consultancy businesses, Caltec and Eclipse have faced  
a challenging year as customers have typically deferred 
discretionary expenditure, we have been pleased with the 
progress with which we have integrated these businesses  
into the group. Of particular note has been the development  
of the rental model for Caltec’s production technology products 
aimed at the enhancement of production from mature fields
■
 In early January 2010, we were pleased to announce the 
acquisition of Scotvalve Services Limited, a mechanical 
services business headquartered in Aberdeen, but with 
interests in the Middle East and North Africa. The acquisition  
of Scotvalve will enable Offshore Engineering & Operations  
to provide repair and maintenance services within a wider 
geographic footprint
Future milestones
■
 We will continue to regularly review acquisition opportunities 
and we have a strong balance sheet to support such 
opportunities
A key factor in the delivery of our strong execution performance  
is our engagement with local resources, through recruiting in  
the local market and establishing long-term relationships with local 
subcontractors, particularly construction subcontractors. These 
relationships increase the local content on projects and ensure that 
the group operates responsibly through improving the competence 
and skills of local workforces.
Progress during 2009
■
 We have established subcontracts with many local and 
regional construction contractors for the new Engineering & 
Construction projects secured during the year. We have 
worked with the vast majority of these contractors before,  
and are confident that with their involvement we can execute 
our contracts in hand to a high standard with local resources. 
Petrofac Training plays an important role in developing national 
workforces and, where necessary, will take an active role in 
developing competence and technical skills on our projects 
which often include local content targets
■
 During the year, we extended our relationship with BP to 
include a three-year training management services contract 
with BP North Sea. We will provide a full administrative training 
package, including identifying, procuring and scheduling all 
training requirements for 2,000 UK-based BP employees
Future milestones
■
 In Saudi Arabia, we are looking to develop our own in-country 
engineering capability to assist us to deliver projects with local 
resources and meet local content goals
■
 Through Training Services, we continue to review  
opportunities to invest in and manage international training 
facilities (we currently operate 15 training facilities in seven 
countries), and we are looking to extend our strategic 
relationships with our key National Oil Company and 
International Oil Company customers
We have always sought to be flexible and innovative with  
our commercial models, providing services under a range  
of commercial structures from reimbursable services (such as 
operations or engineering services), reimbursable services with 
significant key performance indicator (KPI) related income (such  
as Duty Holder or service operator contracts), to the provision  
of lump-sum EPC services, and, when our investment criteria  
are met, we may put our capital at risk and take an equity stake  
in a development.
Progress during 2009
■
 Following our recent reorganisation, we are now looking  
to package together some of our consultancy businesses 
through Production Solutions and to undertake production 
enhancement projects to improve the performance of marginal 
or mature fields, possibly on a tariff or quasi-equity basis
Future milestones
■
 Throughout 2009 we have been holding discussions with 
customers with regard to potential production enhancement 
projects. We hope to be able to secure such a project within 
the coming months, which will allow us to begin to develop  
a track record in this market

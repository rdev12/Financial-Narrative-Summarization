Chief Executive Officer’s report
C
ontinued growth in demand
for data storage solutions,
combined with intense pressure
from companies to reduce the cost
of their IT provision, contributed to
a mixed result from InTechnology’s
two divisions:
• The SSS Division reported a
marginal decline in revenue
versus the prior year but
managed to maintain its
operating margin before goodwill
amortisation at 5.5% (2002:
5.7%) and generate in excess of
£8m of cash. Operating margin
after goodwill amortisation 
was 4.3% (2002: 4.6%).
• The MDS Division, which
provides outsourced secure data
storage and other IT and
network infrastructure services,
has grown by 100.7% in
revenue terms for the third
successive year, though it
remains loss making.
In what has been a challenging
commercial environment in the last
12 months, we have been able to
grow our market share of storage
distribution in the UK; the level of
activity in our MDS Division has
been increasing quarter on quarter;
and in April 2003, we announced
our intention to acquire Allasso,
the specialist pan-European
security products distributor, from
Articon-Integralis, which, if
approved, will provide us with a
firm platform from which we can
replicate our successful UK
business model into other
continental European markets. We,
therefore, look forward to renewed
growth in our business.
SSS Division
Overall revenues for the SSS
division declined by 3.5% against
prior year to £148.7m. However,
this masks some variances in
underlying performance, which saw
year-on-year growth in sales of
IBM and HP products compared to
a relatively significant decline in
sales of Sun storage equipment.
The proportion of software,
maintenance and consultancy
revenue within this division has
also grown in both absolute and
relative terms to some £24.7m
(2002: £19.7m) and we expect this
trend to continue.
Our resilient performance in
challenging circumstances is due in
part to the level of investment we
have made in supporting our
channel partners over a number of
years, (prioritising training,
consultancy for themselves and
their clients) as well as the
commitment of certain leading
vendors to their channel strategies.
The commitment from key vendors
has enabled us to plan our own
investment over an extended
period so that we can secure
adequate returns from this division.
MDS Division
The MDS Division grew revenues
by 100.7% this year as its
contracted pipeline of high quality
customers has expanded from a
cumulative value of £22m of
contracts won in March 2002 to
in excess of £40m today.
We are encouraged by the recent
levels of activity, which have
resulted in winning contracts to
manage the data storage and
infrastructure requirements for
various large private and public
sector clients. In every case we
have worked with consultants,
systems integrators, IT outsourcers
or resellers to provide them with
the infrastructure and skills
necessary to offer a very cost
effective managed service to
their clients.
As companies examine ways to
reduce the costs of their IT
infrastructure; as they recognise the
benefit of having their business-
critical data housed externally with
experts in a post 11 September
world; and, as they become
comfortable with outsourcing
certain infrastructure functions to a
provider like InTechnology with the
skills, economies of scale and an
ability to help them optimise the IT
investments in data storage, so we
expect to see our business grow.
Over the course of this year we are
pleased to have added high-profile
customers such as Harvey Nichols,
The Department for Transport, WS
Atkins, ACAS, GVA Grimley, Scottish
Enterprise, Sitel and Bristows. We
have also increased the average size
and value of contracts won so that
we now manage in excess of 31
terabytes of data for clients and
average customer contract values
have risen to £374,000 from
£311,000 a year ago.
Particularly important this year has
been the increasing level of activity
by our partners with our MDS
Division and the successful
implementation of our high
bandwidth network around the UK, 7
Chief Executive Officer’s report cont.
which we have leased from
Fibernet. Since February 2003, we
have been able to offer a full suite
of managed services in some 19
cities around the UK when
previously we were limited to
central London on account of
regional UK bandwidth prices. As
the benefit of this network to our
Managed Services is just beginning
to be felt, so it should underpin the
continued expansion of this
division in the coming quarters.
We are also beginning to see
renewals of some of the earliest
contracts for our managed storage
service and clients starting to take
incremental infrastructure services
from us such as hosting, VPNs,
firewall management and internet
access. As the trend continues to
outsource IT infrastructure to
specialist companies capable of
providing superior service and
economies of scale, we believe
InTechnology is well positioned to
support such customers’ needs.
Continental Europe
In the course of this year we have
closed our Managed Services
subsidiary in Germany (October
2002) and announced our intention
to acquire the pan-European
specialist security products
distributor, Allasso (April 2003). We
closed the subsidiary because we
believed the time it would take to
generate a profit would be too long
given its limited scale, track record
and nascent relationships with its
channel. Outsourced service
providers are the trusted partners
of clients and these relationships
and reputations take time to
develop. By contrast, Allasso has a
network of well-established and
strong channel relationships; it is
already profitable and has an
experienced management team;
and we believe it will provide a
firm foundation for InTechnology to
expand both its storage distribution
and Managed Services into a
number of Europe’s other major 
IT markets.
The distribution of security
products, particularly firewalls and
VPN technologies, are closely linked
to the sale of network-based
storage products. Allasso has
relationships with some 7,000
resellers, many of whom wish to
become channel partners for
storage. It has 220 employees
operating within the UK, France,
Germany, the Netherlands, Spain
and Italy, and in the year ended
31 December 2002 it generated
revenue of €152.0m and EBITDA of
€10.5m. EBIT was €8.3m.
The acquisition is conditional upon
Articon-Integralis shareholder
approval at a general meeting on
23 June 2003 with anticipated
completion at the end of July 2003.
Creating a competitive 
cost structure
In the market environment in
which we operate it is imperative
to create competitive cost
structures, particularly when our
partners and customers have a
similar focus on value and returns
on investment. In both divisions
and at a central level we have
maintained a policy of careful cost
control this year. This is evidenced
by our continued level of operating
margin within the SSS Division
and a focus of value-engineering
within the MDS Division. The
implementation of our UK network,
for example, has enabled us to
drive substantial levels of cost out
of our higher-end managed 
storage offering.
Outlook
Greater circulation of data,
increased regulation and the use of
more media-rich applications are
obliging companies to continue to
invest in data storage capacity.
Our strategy remains keenly
focused on:
• Consolidating our market share
in storage distribution in the UK;
• Expanding the contribution
to revenue from software
and services;
• Enhancing the rapid growth
of our MDS Division towards
profitability; and 
• The expansion of our businesses
into continental Europe.
While our performance will
continue to be influenced by the
successes and difficulties of our
vendors and partners, we are
confident that we have the
strategy in place to continue to
maximise our performance.

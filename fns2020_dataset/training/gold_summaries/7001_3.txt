In May 2013 we set out the Getting into Gear 
strategy for our Retail business that we would pursue 
and the growth plans for our Autocentre business. 
We are now a year into the journey and progress 
has been very encouraging across a broad front. 
The ride so far has been exciting, the pace high and 
the year has been very busy, touching all parts of 
Halfords. The response of our colleagues has been 
enthusiastic and heartening. Their engagement 
with the many initiatives that Matt Davies and his 
executive team have introduced has been infectious 
and this has begun to have the desired effect: 
increasingly engaged, well trained and committed 
colleagues serve our customers better. There is still 
a way to go but I would like to commence this letter 
by thanking all of our c.12,000 colleagues for a job 
well done. 
Our mission is to Help and Inspire our Customers 
with their Life on the Move. Each element of our 
strategy, which has the customer at the forefront, 
has been pursued with vigour in both our Retail 
and Autocentres businesses. In essence, the thrust 
of our strategy is: to bring about a step change in 
the quality of our service offer to our customers by 
investing in colleague training, staffing and capability; 
reasserting our authority in our key product and 
services categories; investing in our store and 
Autocentres standards and estates and in our 
systems; and creating a more contemporary and 
competitive omnichannel offer. The report that follows 
sets out the progress we are making and what still 
needs to be done. 
Transparent measurement of our progress is critical, 
as is linking this to our remuneration and incentive 
structures throughout the organisation. In the report 
we have also set out in detail our Shareholder, Retail 
and Autocentre KPIs and our performance this year 
at pages 52 to 63. Progress has been encouraging. 
However, most heartening has been the improvement 
in our service delivery with customer response, 
as measured by our Net Promoter Scores (NPS), 
showing a significant and sustained improvement 
across both businesses. Given where we were a year 
ago this is particularly pleasing. Once again, there is 
still some way to go.
The financial performance of Retail was better than 
we had expected at the commencement of the 
year. Retail sales of £803m were up 7.6% on a 
like-for-like (LFL) basis with a stellar performance in 
the Cycling category with LFL sales rising 19.4%. 
Car Maintenance was up 4.9% and online sales, 
primarily Click & Collect, rose a healthy 17.7%. Retail 
gross margin was down as we cleared inventory, 
in may 2013 we set 
out the Gettin G into

as planned, and due to the strong growth of the 
lower-margin Cycling category. Retail operating costs 
rose, commensurate with the significant investment 
we made, and are making, in the training and 
development of our colleagues, better colleague 
store and centre coverage, higher activity levels and 
increased incentives as most operational and strategic 
milestones were reached. This resulted in Retail 
operating profit of £75.2m for the year, up 2.2%.
Driving the progress and performance of the Retail 
business is largely a new management team that 
Matt brought together during the year. Andrew 
Findlay (Finance & IT) and Jonathan Crookall 
(People), who have been with the Company for 
over three years, were joined by Rob Swyer (Retail/ 
Stores), Emma Fox (Commercial/Marketing/Digital) 
and Jason Keegan (Supply Chain). The impact of the 
new team has been immediate and effective.
The financial performance of Autocentres was 
disappointing. Sales increased by 8.6%, boosted 
by an increase of 23 to 303 centres during the year, 
with LFL sales down 0.1%. Despite an increase in 
gross margin, operating profit decreased £2.0m to 
£4.3m. Midway through the year there was a change 
in leadership and Andrew Findlay temporarily took 
over the reins and successfully began a process 
of gradual improvement. He has now handed over 
the baton to Andy Randall who joined us in March 
2014. The business is now travelling better than this 
time last year and Andy will be given the time and 
resource to get ‘under the bonnet’ of the business. 
In November we will present a fresh view of the way 
forward for Autocentres.
Investment in our stores, infrastructure and 
colleagues of some £100m over the three years in 
our Getting into Gear plan remains on track. In the 
year, £30.4m of spend on stores, IT infrastructure 
and on new Autocentres was outlaid, some 
£12.0m more than the previous year. In addition, an 
incremental investment of £17.0m in Retail inventory 
to achieve the right levels and product ranges was 
made. Despite these outlays and a one-off tax 
payment of £21.0m, cash flow was once again 
robust and net debt decreased to £99.6m with 
gearing at a comfortable 1.0 times net debt:EBITDA.
Group underlying profit before tax of £72.8m 
is marginally up on last year but exceeded our 
expectations set out over a year ago. Earnings per 
share (before non-recurring items) of 28.8p were up 
4% and the Board is recommending a final dividend 
of 9.1p, taking the total for the year to 14.3p. It is our 
intention to maintain a c.2x dividend cover over the 
medium term, growing full-year dividends broadly in 
line with earnings per share. 
One of the most truly inspiring aspects of the year 
has been the involvement by colleagues at all levels 
in a large number of community initiatives. For 
example, a partnership was forged with Re~Cycle, a 
charity that collects and ships second-hand bicycles 
to community networks in Africa. There the bicycles 
are repaired, thereby providing employment, and are 
then made available to disadvantaged communities. 
Through two events, customers responded 
generously by donating over 10,000 of their old 
bikes to this cause. Kids’ Holiday Bike Club events 
were held in-store where children were taught how 
to maintain their bikes and road safety; the response 
was fantastic and over 20,000 children and parents 
attended. Halfords has also been confirmed as the 
Official Mechanics Partner for the 2014 Sky Ride 
Big Bike series, spanning 14 events nationwide and 
supporting over 100,000 cyclists this summer. There 
were also many other local events and the buzz 
that these community activities produce throughout 
Halfords is tangible; it is no doubt that it was one of 
the key factors that saw our colleagues vote Halfords 
as one of the Top 25 Best Big UK Companies to 
Work For.

Enthusiasts increasingly 
attracted to Halfords.
It is a joy and a privilege to chair the Halfords Board 
and to work with Matt and his team. It is therefore 
with sadness that we say goodbye to Bill Ronald 
and Keith Harris who leave the Board at the end 
of May 2014 after 10 years’ service. Both joined at 
the initial listing of Halfords in 2004 and have been 
a source of much sound advice and support to me 
and fellow Board members, for which I thank them. 
It gives me pleasure to welcome Helen Jones who 
joined the Board in March 2014. Helen is currently 
a senior executive at Caffé Nero and, prior to that, 
was CEO of the Zizzi Restaurants group and was 
also responsible for successfully launching the Ben & 
Jerry’s brand in the UK and Europe. She will provide 
valuable brand positioning and marketing and 
experience in managing multiple-outlet networks.
The new financial year has started positively and the 
progress being made with all aspects of our strategy 
continues apace. The ambitious targets we set at the 
outset of the Getting into Gear Retail strategy remain 
both valid and achievable.

Chief Executive’s Q&A
Discussion on business and strategy with CEO
Q
 What do you mean by 
doing more, faster , for less?
Cloud computing offers a quantum leap 
forward in productivity for portfolio 
analytics. Clients can do more because 
we have brought together all our 
expertise in one product and added 
more functions. It is faster because the 
processes that have slowed things down 
in the past have been removed or made 
so efficient that you don’t notice them 
any more and it costs less because the 
economies of scale we are able to gain 
by being cloud-based are amazing. The 
gain can be a factor of 30 or more.
Q
 What's so important 
about sharing and what 
does this mean for the 
future of StatPro?
Every portfolio is a network. You have 
the owner of the portfolio, the advisor, 
the manager, the regulator and other 
experts who all have an interest or 
responsibility in that portfolio. So a 
fund manager shares with a pension 
fund, a pension fund might share with 
a pension consultant, a fund of fund 
manager shares with private wealth 
companies, private wealth companies 
will share with their clients. Each needs 
to do this in a safe and secure way and 
StatPro Revolution does it brilliantly.

Q
 What benefits can 
existing clients get from 
StatPro Revolution today?
StatPro Revolution provides a wonderful 
method of communicating with your 
clients as well as with other people in your 
business. StatPro Seven was designed to 
produce analysis, not really to distribute 
it. Do you remember when we used to 
get monthly printed bank statements 
only by post? Now we can just go online 
and see our account. The same benefits 
are now available for portfolio analysis 
and our clients of StatPro Seven will 
find it easy to add StatPro Revolution 
and start reaping those benefits now.
Q
 What makes StatPro 
different?
I think it is our vision and our ambition. 
We could not have built StatPro 
Revolution without a desire to build the 
best, most efficient, most useful portfolio 
analytics system in the world. Without 
the stubbornness to ignore the naysayers 
and overcome all the many complex 
physical challenges, it would also have 
been impossible. But today we have a 
service that has 3.2 million asset histories, 
thousands of indexes and a rapidly rising 
number of clients and portfolios. We’re 
different because we sit across the whole 
platform, we encompass every level of 
the supply chain. It is what people want.
Q
 What does the future 
hold for StatPro?
Our vision is that our clients will be 
able to use not only all the analytics we 
provide through StatPro Revolution, but 
also access the products and services of 
our current and future partners. What 
is more, we hope that our clients will 
take increasing advantage of the sharing 
functionality to enable their clients 
and colleagues to see their portfolios. 
StatPro Revolution is to monthly client 
reports what online banking is to 
monthly bank statements: the future.
Q
 What corporate and 
social responsibilities does 
StatPro take part in?
It is a firm belief of the people in StatPro 
that education is one of the most valuable 
gifts any of us can have. In the West we 
take this for granted, but in Africa it is 
a privilege. Specifically in South Africa, 
a college education can increase your 
potential salary five to 10 times. This is 
why StatPro has pledged to contribute 
1% of annual revenue from StatPro 
Revolution to fund the education of 
school children in and around Cape Town. 
Our sponsorship has enabled 23 students 
in 2012 to get an education that would 
otherwise have been impossible. We have 
been gradually increasing sponsorship 
over the last five years and we have some 
wonderful success stories. Our view is 
that the imbalance between the rich and 
poor is largely one of unequal opportunity 
and access to education. Over the next 
50 years, we hope that South Africa can 
transform its society and make it better 
balanced through the spread of higher 
education. The students we are helping to 
educate today, will join the growing ranks 
of taxpayers, effectively paying back the 
investment being made in them through 
their taxes. StatPro can’t do much, but 
we can do something and we believe 
that the compound effect of sustained 
support for education will make its mark. 
On a sadder note, Mike Walsh, who was 
our leading US salesman, was struck 
down by a brain tumour around Easter 
2011. He had surgery and intensive care, 
but after a long fight, he succumbed to 
the illness in May 2012. Mike was only 44 
years old, in great form and married with 
two daughters who were two and three 
years old when he died. Mike was not only 
a great salesman, but also someone who 
led by example and worked extremely 
hard. It was not by accident that he was 
always our best or second best salesman 
each year. We decided that in memory 
of Mike we would create the Mike Walsh 
Award for the top selling salesman each 
year. A prize of 1% of the value of the 
sales made by the winner is split between 
the salesman and a foundation we have 
set up for his two daughters. The hope 
is that over the years, the value of the 
foundation will grow to help fund the 
college education of his daughters.

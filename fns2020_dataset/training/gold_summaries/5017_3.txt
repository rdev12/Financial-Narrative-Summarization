 Dunelm Group plc Annual report & accounts 2009

Chairman’s statement
The last 12 months have been challenging 
for all retailers. The number of business 
failures has increased significantly, and has 
included some well known names with 
involvement in the homewares market. 
Against this difficult background, Dunelm 
has demonstrated great resilience as 
customers have continued to buy into our 
‘Simply Value For Money’ proposition. 
We expect that the retail environment  
will remain challenging for some time, 
reflecting the depth of the background 
difficulties in the UK economy. In this 
scenario, consumers’ continual search  
for better value, together with a trend 
towards switching of expenditure into 
home improvements, leaves us well 
positioned to make further progress.
After the end of the financial year we 
welcomed a new Non-Executive Director  
to the Board, appointing Nick Wharton, 
Finance Director of Halfords Group plc.  
His wealth of experience and knowledge  
of the retail sector will be a great asset  
to the Board as we continue to pursue our 
growth strategy.
Focusing on 
developing the 
customer offer
Dunelm has 
demonstrated 
great resilience.
The business celebrates its 30th year of 
operations with another year of increase  
in sales and profits. In addition, there was 
strong positive cash generation and we 
ended the year with significant cash 
surplus. This strong performance has 
enabled the Board to recommend a 9.1% 
increase in the dividend, broadly in line 
with the growth in earnings per share.  
The Group remains in a very strong position 
to continue our strategy of investing in 
organic growth in the coming years.

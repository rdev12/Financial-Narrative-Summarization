Business and other highlights
•	 Strong order intake: in Invensys Rail, with major awards for
rail signalling contracts in both new and core markets; and
good momentum across all lines of business in Invensys 
Operations Management 
•	 Good revenue growth across the Group driven by large
greenfield contracts in Invensys Operations Management 
and new market contracts at Invensys Rail, offset by a 
reduction at Invensys Controls
•	 Sound financial position following the signing of new £600 million
bank facilities and reaching final agreement on triennial review 
of the Invensys Pension Scheme (UK), which resulted in no change
in the funding plan
Social and environmental performance

by 9% in the year, a reduction of 5% on a same site basis

 Chairman’s 
statement
“ I am pleased to 
report 2015 was 
another year of 
solid growth, building 
on the trend of 
previous years.” 
Group revenue
1
 for the year ended 30 June 2015 
increased by 13% to £3.3bn (2014: £2.9bn) and 
underlying operating profit
1,2
 increased by 19% to 
£103.7m (2014: £87.3m). Overall, underlying operating 
margins
1,2
 were robust at 2.2% in the Construction 
division (2014
3
: 2.0%) and 4.7% in the Services division 
(2014: 4.8%), in line with expectations. The Property 
division made a significant contribution with underlying 
operating profit
2
 of £22.7m (2014
3
: £16.0m) and the 
Residential division also performed well, with underlying 
operating profit
2
 of £11.2m (2014
3
: £7.7m).
Underlying profit before tax
1,2
 for the year of £85.9m 
(2014: £73.7m) and underlying earnings per share
1,2
 
of 96.0p (2014
4
: 87.5p as adjusted for the effect 
of the rights issue associated with the Mouchel 
transaction) were both in line with expectations.
We remain focused on our five-year strategy, 
Vision 2020, and its strategic goals which are 
aimed to increase the Group's profitability and 
scale of operations both organically and through 
acquisition, whilst continuing to improve the quality 
of our earnings. 
In June 2015, the Group completed the acquisition 
of Mouchel, the international infrastructure services 
and business services group, in line with the Group’s 
Vision 2020 goal to be top three in its chosen markets 
and thereby accelerating the delivery of the Vision 
2020 growth strategy. The acquisition brought together 
Mouchel’s leading position in the strategic highways 
services market and Kier’s presence in the local 
authority roads market. As such, it positions Kier 
as the sector leader in the growing UK highways 
maintenance and management market. 
£47.3m
Full-year dividend
(2014: £39.4m)
96.0p
Underlying earnings 
per share
1,2,4
(2014: 87.5p)
Having increased the Group’s size over the last 
two years, we are focused on continuing to improve 
the quality of our earnings and are simplifying and 
restructuring our business, investing in our future 
growth. Consequently, in early July 2015 we 
disposed of our fleet & passenger services business 
and our UK coal mining business has been prepared 
for sale.
Dividend
As a result of the acquisition of Mouchel, the 
proposed final dividend in respect of the year 
ending 30 June 2015 has been adjusted to take 
into account the increased number of shares in 
issue following the completion of the rights issue. 
To reflect the Board’s continued confidence in the 
Group, a total dividend for the year of £47.3m, 
a 20% increase (55.2 pence per share)
4
, is 
proposed. Subject to shareholder approval, the final 
dividend of 36.0 pence per share will be paid on 
27 November 2015 to shareholders on the register 
at the close of business on 25 September 2015. 
A scrip dividend alternative will also be available.
The Board
As the Group continues to grow, it is important that 
we look at the composition of the Board. During this 
year, a number of senior management changes took 
place including Haydn Mursell formally taking up the 
role of Chief Executive in July 2014.
In January 2015, Bev Dew joined the Board as 
Finance Director. In March 2015, Nigel Brook 
(Executive Director – Construction and Infrastructure 
Services), Nigel Turner (Executive Director – 
Developments and Property Services) and Claudio 
Veritiero (Group Strategy and Corporate Development 
Director) joined the Board, reflecting the increased 
size and breadth of the Group. It was particularly 
pleasing that three of these four appointments were 
internal. As a consequence of this reorganisation, 
Steve Bowcott, Chief Operating Officer, left the 
Board and the business at the end of April 2015. 
These appointments are a strong addition to the 
Board ensuring the Group has the range of skills, 
experience and expertise at Board level to deliver 
its five-year strategy, Vision 2020.
On 31 July 2015, it was announced that Justin 
Atkinson will join the Board as a non-executive 
director with effect from 1 October 2015. With 
over 20 years’ experience at Keller Group, of which 
15 years were as Chief Finance Officer and then 
Chief Executive, Justin has a deep knowledge of the 
construction sector and operating internationally. 
I would like to welcome Justin to the Board.

4 Our people
As the Group increases in size, it is important to 
develop consistent and efficient working practices 
across our teams. We believe our values – 
enthusiastic, collaborative and forward-thinking – 
enable us to work effectively in partnership with our 
clients. I would like to thank all of our people for their 
commitment, professionalism and hard work during 
this year.
Outlook
I am pleased to announce we have delivered solid 
growth and increased profitability. Economic confidence 
is returning to our core markets and, furthermore, 
the acquisition of Mouchel represents a major step 
in accelerating the Group’s five-year strategy.
All our divisions have performed well. In Property, the 
market remains strong and we have ample support 
from funders and other investors. Following its 
expansion, our Residential division is well-placed 
to help address the national shortage of affordable 
housing. In Construction, the regional building 
business has an established position on public and 
private sector frameworks and our infrastructure 
business is benefiting from continued greater 
investment by the UK Government in infrastructure in 
the medium term, and internationally, the Middle 
East pipeline is strengthening. Our Services division 
will benefit from the £700m AMP6 contracts secured 
during the year and the Mouchel acquisition has made 
Kier the sector leader in the UK highways management 
and maintenance sector. We are committed to 
offering a full, integrated approach to our clients by 
maximising the breadth and combination of capabilities 
available in the Group, assisting them to address the 
budget challenges they face.
We continue to simplify the portfolio and restructure 
our businesses and invest in our future growth. We 
continue to improve the quality of our earnings to 
reflect the changing demands of our markets. With 
a £9.3bn order book, a strong balance sheet and 
continued progress on our Vision 2020 goals this 
year, we look forward to the future with confidence.

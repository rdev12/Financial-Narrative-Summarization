Key achievements
The highlight of 2011 was our admission to the London 
Stock Exchange’s Official List in November. 
Historically the Russian financial markets have proved to be 
too limited and too volatile for a business such as Polymetal. 
These challenges create a significant disadvantage for both 
the Company and its long-term stakeholders. The London 
listing was a reflection of our intention to raise the Company’s 
profile with the international investment community and 
improve its marketability. 
We received a positive response to the IPO from the majority 
of existing shareholders and attracted many new investors. 
The move has resulted in increased interest in Polymetal from 
a more diversified investor base, significantly improving the 
liquidity of the stock. We now have greater access to capital 
to fund organic growth and create a currency for any potential 
consolidation opportunities. 
Our inclusion in the benchmark FTSE 100 index brings with  
it additional tracker funds, which will also considerably 
enhance our access to new finance.
Polymetal has always sought to uphold the highest standards 
of corporate governance and transparency and has further 
strengthened the Board as part of the UK listing. This focus 
on continuous improvement demonstrates our ongoing 
commitment to best practice in this field.

Drilled 4 wells, including successful Kraken

primarily on Mariner and Kraken.
Raised £20.0m in October 2007.
Farmouts once again endorsed quality of assets, 
with premium terms being achieved, meaning 
limited financial exposure on the wells drilled 
during the period and late 2008.
Kraken and Mariner on track for Field Development 
Plan (FDP) submissions in late 2009/mid-2010.
Cash resources of £20.1m to take your Company to

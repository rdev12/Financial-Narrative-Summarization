 DIVIDEND 2003 pence
This was the fourth successive year in
which ICAP has performed extremely well.
Group turnover during that period has
risen by 73% and profit before tax,
goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items by 225%. ICAP’s total return to
shareholders over the past four years has
been 507%. This reflects our continuing
ability to produce very good results in a
highly competitive environment. This year
there have been strong contributions
from almost all products and markets.
The markets that have shown outstanding
growth have been medium term interest
rate derivatives, credit derivatives and
segments of the fixed income securities
markets.
The directors recommend a final dividend of
5.7p per share to be paid on 27 August
2004 to shareholders on the register on
30 July 2004 making a total dividend of
7.4p per share for the year. The increase
of 23% is consistent with our progressive
approach to the dividend and our confidence
in the cash generative nature of the business.
To improve further the marketability and
liquidity in ICAP’s shares, on 9 February
2004 we implemented a split of the
Company’s ordinary shares of 50p into 
five new ordinary shares of 10p each. 
The daily average volume of shares
traded in the first three months following
the share split increased from the equivalent
of 2.7 million (0.52% of issued share
capital) in 2003 to 4.7 million (0.82% 
of issued share capital) in 2004. 
Issues of corporate governance command
a significant profile in the management 
of public companies and we respect the
demand for high standards of governance.
We comply fully with the provisions of the
Combined Code for the year ended 31 March
2004 and believe that we are already
substantially compliant with the new
Combined Code that will apply to the
Group for the year ending 31 March 2005. 
Chairman’s Statement   The Group’s profit before tax, goodwill amortisation and exceptional items
was £170.2 million for the year to 31 March 2004 compared with £123.7 million for the previous year.
Shareholders’ funds at 31 March 2004 were £468.2 million, up £215.6 million. Profit before tax on
a statutory basis was £130.5 million, up £13.0 million.

6.0 Two of our non-executive directors, Bob Knox
and Don Marshall, retired from the board
during the year. I would like to thank them
both for their considerable contributions to
ICAP during a period when the business
has grown significantly. Two non-executive
directors have joined the board, Duncan
Goldie-Morrison and Jim McNulty. They
bring broad experience of the global
financial markets including management,
technology and risk management
together with exchange and OTC trading. 
I am sure that the combination of their
expertise will be extremely valuable to 
the Group.
ICAP’s annual Charity Day, held in December,
is a very special day for the charities that
benefit from the proceeds of one day’s
broking revenue. In 2003 an astonishing
£4 million was raised. Over the past 11 years,
ICAP staff and customers have raised
more than £17 million. During this time
we have been able to help many people
around the world and none of this could
have been achieved without the generosity
and enthusiasm of ICAP’s staff and customers.
Once again I would like to thank them 
all - every deal really counted!
Staff numbers have increased during the
year from 2,700 to 2,900, largely as a
result of the acquisition of the BrokerTec
business. Although competition for quality
staff remains high, we have continued to
strengthen our business through selective
recruitment. I would like to take the
opportunity to thank all our staff for the
tremendous effort that they have made
this year. 
We have a proven business model that is
based on a successful combination of our
staff and our technologies. Our strategy is
clear and our implementation has been
extremely effective, including the
integration of BrokerTec. As a result we
are in a strong position to benefit from
the continuing development of our
markets.

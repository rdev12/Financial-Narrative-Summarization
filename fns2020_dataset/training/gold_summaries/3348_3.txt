Dear Shareholder,
I am pleased to report that 2006 has been another successful
year for Charter. The Company has achieved excellent results
with operating profits having increased by 41 per cent to
£143.2 million, pre tax profits by 40 per cent to £144.6 million
and adjusted earnings per share by 56 per cent to 67.2 pence
per share.
In 2006, ESAB’s and Howden’s operating margins were
11.9 per cent (2005: 10.3 per cent) and 11.5 per cent (2005:
9.7 per cent) respectively.
As shown in the table opposite, in 2006 Charter generated sales
of £1,257.9 million (2005: £1,065.7 million), an increase of 18 per
cent, and operating profit of £143.2 million (2005: £101.7 million),
an increase of 41 per cent. Profit before tax was £144.6 million
(2005: £103.5 million), an increase of 40 per cent, and profit
attributable to equity shareholders was £122.0 million (2005: £74.0
million), an increase of 65 per cent. Adjusted earnings per share
were 67.2 pence (2005: 43.0 pence), an increase of 56 per cent.
Tax
The tax charge fell, despite increased profits, to £16.9 million
(2005: £20.0 million) due to a reduction in the adjusted effective
tax rate for the year to 19.6 per cent (2005: 21.4 per cent),
mainly as a consequence of increased profits generated in low
tax jurisdictions, and an exceptional tax credit of £10.5 million
(2005: nil) arising from the recognition of deferred tax assets
in North America.
Cash flow
During the year, cash generated from operations was £106.8
million (2005: £84.5 million), an increase of 26 per cent. Capital
expenditure was £26.9 million (2005: £22.2 million), an increase
of 21 per cent, whereas the depreciation charge amounted to
only £13.5 million (2005: £14.7 million). Net debt, which stood
at £6.5 million at the end of 2005, was eliminated and at
31 December 2006 there was net cash of £43.1 million.

Board
On 1 July 2006 Michael Foster, who had previously been
Commercial Director, succeeded me as Chief Executive and
I assumed a transitional role as part-time Executive Chairman.
James Deeley joined the Board of the Company as Legal
Director and Company Secretary on 10 July 2006.
Retirement benefit obligations
As at 31 December 2006, net retirement benefit obligations,
as provided for in the consolidated balance sheet, amounted
to £108.6 million (2005: £127.1 million) and gross defined
benefit liabilities are £663.2 million (2005: £690.5 million),
the great majority of which are in respect of past employees.
The liabilities in respect of retirement benefits are subject
to movements in long term interest rates and changes in life
expectancy. The net retirement benefit obligations are also
subject to movements in the value of assets held by the schemes,
which are principally shares and bonds. Future cash contributions
to the schemes will also depend on other factors, such as the
outcome of negotiations with the pension trustees and changes
in legislation.
In respect of 2006, an amount of £3.2 million (2005: £7.6 million)
was charged against operating profit in relation to defined benefit
schemes and overseas medical costs. The cash contribution
into the schemes during the year was £17.5 million (2005:
£18.4 million).
Contingent liabilities
As previously disclosed, the Company and certain of its subsidiary
undertakings are named as defendants in a number of lawsuits
in the United States. These claims continue to be vigorously
defended and further details are set out in Note 26 to the
consolidated financial statements.
Equity shareholders’ funds
Shareholders will be aware that at 31 December 2004 equity
shareholders’ funds were only £11.5 million and indeed were in
deficit a few years earlier. During the past two years, the balance
sheet has been strengthened in part through the rights issue
in 2004 which raised £44.6 million and in part through retained
earnings, such that, by 31 December 2006, equity shareholders’
funds had grown to £250.7 million.
Despite the substantial improvement in equity shareholders’
funds that has been achieved over the past two years, the Board
believes that the scale and geographic spread of the Company’s
business activities necessitate a further strengthening of equity
shareholders’ funds through the retention of profit.
Dividend
In light of the above, the Board has decided not to recommend
a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2006 but
intends to review dividend policy later in the year and envisages
that the Company will declare a final dividend in respect of the
financial year ending 31 December 2007, provided that the
general economic environment and the trading and financial
condition of the Company and its businesses are broadly
in line with the Board’s current expectations.
Prospects
The trading in ESAB and Howden in the first two months of 2007
has been encouraging and continues to benefit from favourable
market conditions. Demand for ESAB’s products generally
remains strong in the key markets in which it operates, and
particularly so in emerging markets. For Howden, order intake
in the first two months of the year has been strong, especially
from the power market in North America.
For these reasons, and in the light of the excellent results achieved
in 2006, the Board views the trading prospects of the Company
and its businesses for 2007 with increasing confidence.
David Gawler
Chairman

Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking 
statements: This Annual Report may contain forward-
looking statements which are made in good faith 
and are based on current expectations or beliefs, 
as well as assumptions about future events. You can 
sometimes, but not always, identify these statements 
by the use of a date in the future or such words as 
“will”, “anticipate”, “estimate”, “expect”, “project”, 
“intend”, “plan”, “should”, “may”, “assume” and 
other similar words. By their nature, forward-looking 
statements are inherently predictive and speculative 
and involve risk and uncertainty because they relate 
to events and depend on circumstances that will occur 
in the future. You should not place undue reliance on 
these forward-looking statements, which are not a 
guarantee of future performance and are subject to 
factors that could cause our actual results to differ 
materially from those expressed or implied by these 
statements. The Company undertakes no obligation 
to update any forward-looking statements contained 
in this Annual Report, whether as a result of new 
information, future events or otherwise.

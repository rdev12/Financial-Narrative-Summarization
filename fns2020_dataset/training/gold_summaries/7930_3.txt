 OVERVIEW
Chairman’s Statement
IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009 3
Our focus on sales growth, optimising
our cost base and efficiently utilising the
cash we generate, has enabled us to drive
growth and deliver volume and market share
gains in many markets across our regions.
Whilst tobacco is not immune from the
current difficulties affecting the global
economy, we have a successful strategy
and a resilient business.
Earnings and Dividends
Our adjusted profit from operations
increased by 32 per cent to £2.9 billion,
while reported profit from operations
grew by 59 per cent to £2.3 billion. Our
performance reflects a full year’s contribution
from Altadis compared with eight months
in 2008, good organic growth, synergy
benefits and currency translation gains.
A YEAR OF CONSIDERABLE
ACHIEVEMENT
Iain Napier
Chairman
“We have delivered another strong operational
and financial performance, further building on
our excellent track record of creating sustainable
shareholder value.”

4 IMPERIAL TOBACCO GROUP PLC 2009
Our adjusted earnings per share have
risen by 18 per cent to 161.8 pence. Basic
earnings per share were 65.5 pence (2008:
50.6 pence). The Board recommends a
final dividend of 52.0 pence per share,
bringing the total dividend for the year to
73.0 pence per share
1
(2008: 63.1 pence,
adjusted for the bonus element of the
rights issue in June 2008). This represents
growth of 16 per cent.
Altadis Synergy Delivery
We have made considerable progress with
the integration of Altadis during the year.
We delivered €147 million synergies in our
current financial year, bringing the total to
€190 million to date, €10 million ahead of
our target. We remain very confident of
achieving our previously announced target
of €400 million cumulative synergies by
the end of our 2012 financial year and our
net revenue synergy target of €60 million
by 2011.
Operational Performance
These results again demonstrate the
strength of our versatile brand and product
portfolio and wider geographic reach.
Our powerful portfolio spans all tobacco
product categories and price points and
enables us to quickly align with local
market consumer preferences.
Our particular strength in value cigarettes
and our world leadership in fine cut
tobacco has enabled us to capitalise on
consumer downtrading and is an advantage
in the current economic climate.
We have focused on building sales of our
international premium and mainstream
cigarette brands, Davidoff and
Gauloises Blondes.
We have made great advances in a
number of emerging markets including
Asia, Eastern Europe, Africa and the
Middle East. We also continued to
strengthen our position in mature markets,
with good financial results in the UK,
Germany, Spain and France.
We took steps to improve the competitive
position of our world leading cigar business
through cost optimisation and portfolio
rationalisation initiatives.
Strengthening our balance sheet is a
priority and we made excellent progress
during the year. Strong cash generation
has been a consistent hallmark of Imperial
Tobacco. We have delivered a cash
conversion rate of 128 per cent reflecting
£1 billion in working capital improvements.
As a result we have reduced our adjusted
net debt by over £2 billion, excluding the
impact of foreign exchange movements.
We also raised £3.9 billion in the year
through bond issues such that we now
have no refinancing requirements until 2012.
Corporate Governance
Our stakeholders rightly expect us to act
in a fair and responsible manner and our
commitment to high standards of conduct
and performance is as strong as ever.
Our Corporate Governance and internal
control procedures include appropriate
policies and procedures in place to meet
the high standards expected of us.
Board Changes
In November we announced that Gareth
Davis, Chief Executive Officer, will retire
in May 2010 and will be succeeded by
Alison Cooper, currently Chief Operating
Officer. Gareth and Alison will continue to
work closely together to ensure an orderly
handover during the next six months.
Gareth was appointed Chief Executive
Officer in 1996 and under his leadership
Imperial Tobacco has developed from a
predominantly UK business into one of
the world’s leading international tobacco
companies. He has made an outstanding
contribution to our success and on behalf
of the Board and our employees I would like
to express our gratitude for his tremendous
commitment, drive and dedication.
I am delighted that Alison will succeed
Gareth. She has an exemplary track record
in our business and has played a key role
in driving our international expansion. Alison
has held a number of senior positions
in the business as part of her ongoing
development and was appointed Chief
Operating Officer in March. Her leadership
capabilities and strategic vision will ensure
that Imperial Tobacco continues to evolve
and maximise growth opportunities.
In September, Bruno Bich resigned as
a consequence of his overall business
commitments. I would like to thank him
for his contribution to the Company since
his appointment to the Board last year
and wish him well for the future.
Finally, my thanks to our employees
who have worked hard to drive the
performance of the business in a
challenging operating environment.
Our focus on sales growth, underpinned
by our diligent approach to cost and cash
management, enables us to look to the
future with confidence and leaves us
well positioned to continue to create
sustainable value for our shareholders.

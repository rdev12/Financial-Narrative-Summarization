It excludes the Run-off segment, restructuring and other one-off costs and gain on disposal of subsidiary.
2. Operating expenses and claims handling expenses from ongoing operations. It excludes the Run-off segment and restructuring and other one-off costs.
3. Return on tangible equity (“RoTE”) is adjusted profit after tax from ongoing operations divided by the Group’s average tangible shareholders’ equity.  
Profit after tax is adjusted to exclude the Run-off segment, restructuring and other one-off costs and gain on disposal of subsidiary and is stated after  
charging tax (using the UK standard tax rate of 23.25%; 2012: 24.5%).
4. Pro forma RoTE is based on the return on tangible equity, but assumes that the capital actions taken by the Group prior to the initial public offering  
(£1 billion dividend payment and £500 million long-term subordinated debt issue) occurred on 1 January 2012.

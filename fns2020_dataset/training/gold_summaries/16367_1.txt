 12 Umeco plc Annual Report 2012
Chief Executive’s Review
Andrew Moss
Chief Executive
Umeco is an advanced composite materials business delivering 
innovation that provides real advantage across the globe for blue chip 
manufacturers. 
Advanced composite materials are light weight and high-performance, 
characteristics for which there is growing demand across a wide 
range of end markets. There are strong structural drivers of growth in 
our markets with an increasing requirement for materials that address 
issues associated with rising fuel prices and concerns for the 
environment.
Our strategy is to focus our efforts on higher growth end markets and 
we aim to grow our share in these markets by exploiting our proven 
portfolio of products and technologies and building on long term and 
well established blue chip customer relationships. Our technology, 
know-how and service levels are key differentiators which set us 
apart from the competition.
Today, we are well positioned and are now unified around a single 
Umeco brand. This joined up approach is critical to our growth plans 
and our ability to better leverage our customer relationships and 
service ethos under one trading name which is a global leader in the 
market for advanced composites. 
Results
Umeco grew revenue by 7.5 per cent to £223.0 million and adjusted 
operating profit by 11.3 per cent to £21.7 million, reflecting strong 
growth in our aerospace activities partially offset by weakness in the 
wind energy sector.
Our business is managed through two business streams – Structural 
Materials and Process Materials.
Structural Materials
Structural Materials develops, manufactures and supplies a broad 
range of advanced composite materials. It also has a growing 
European presence in the distribution of composite resins, 
reinforcements and related products.
Structural Materials enjoyed good growth in its revenues from 
aerospace & defence, recreation, especially motorsport, and other 
industrial sectors. Revenue growth from our distribution activities in 
Europe contributed 3.9 per cent of the overall 15.8 per cent growth. 
Operating profits grew by 5.6 per cent with the lower operating 
margin in the year reflecting revenue growth biased toward the lower 
margin distribution business, coupled with lower research & 
development grant income in the first half of the year.

Aerospace & defence 
Structural Materials’ aerospace & defence revenues grew by 12.4 per 
cent, led by our UK business. This was largely driven by demand for 
ballistic protection materials for the 200 vehicle Foxhound contract 
awarded to Force Protection Europe by the UK Ministry of Defence.  
This order was completed in February 2012 and work immediately 
commenced on a follow-on order for materials for a further 100 vehicles.
We are pleased with the progress we are making on materials, including 
our out-of-autoclave product range, for which we are the only source 
qualified by Airbus, and tooling for A350 XWB applications. In March 
2012, we announced that GE Aviation placed an order for the first 18 ship 
sets of our MTM
®
44-1 out-of-autoclave prepreg for the outer and 
mid-section fixed trailing edge panels for the Airbus A350 XWB wing. 
Wind energy 
Structural Materials’ relatively low revenues in the wind energy sector 
decreased during the year as a result of reduced demand for our specialist 
materials used in the structure of moulding tools for turbine blades. 
Recreation
Revenue in this sector, which includes motorsport, marine and other 
sporting goods applications, grew by 20.4 per cent. During the year, we 
were successful in winning further sales in Formula 1 and this made a

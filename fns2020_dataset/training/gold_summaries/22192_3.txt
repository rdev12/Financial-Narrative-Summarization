CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
P PE EO OP PL LE E
Seán Mahon retired as Chief Executive 
on 30 September 2007. On behalf of the
Board I thank him for his outstanding
leadership over the past seven years and
wish him the best for the future. He was
succeeded by David Postings, previously
Managing Director of Lloyds TSB
Commercial, who joined the Board on 
1 September 2007. David’s experience in
senior roles at both Lloyds TSB and
Barclays will be invaluable as the Group
pursues further profitable growth.
The quality of our people, and the strength
and stability of the management team,
have been critical to our success. T o
continue to grow the business we have
increased our investment in training and
development. Our positive, performance-
oriented culture is reflected in the
continued rise in colleagues’ satisfaction
and pride in working for the Group. On
behalf of the Board, I thank them for their
contribution to another year’s strong
performance.
O OU UT TL LO OO OK K
I believe our strategy for enhancing
shareholder value through disciplined
lending growth, robust credit quality and
improving operational and financial
efficiency remains sound and appropriate
to current market conditions. T ogether
with my fellow directors, I look forward to
another successful year in 2008.
Norman Broadhurst
Chairman

‘It gives me great pleasure to report
an excellent performance by 
the Group in 2007, building on our
success of previous years. Pre-tax
profit increased by 24.9% to £165.2
million and basic earnings per share
increased by 15.3% to 32.30p.’
D DI IV VI ID DE EN ND D
The Board recommends an increased final
dividend of 13.10p per share, payable on
13 May 2008. T ogether with the interim
dividend of 6.20p per share, this gives a
total dividend for the year of 19.30p – an
increase of 10.3% over the previous year.
As an alternative to receiving the cash
dividend, shareholders in the UK,
excluding the Channel Islands, will again
have the opportunity to reinvest their
dividends in the Company’s shares
through our Dividend Reinvestment Plan.

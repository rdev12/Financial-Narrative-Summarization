Business review BTG plc Annual Report and Accounts 2012
Highlights
We have delivered a strong 
financial performance during the 
2011/12 year. The increase in 
revenue reflects the transition to 
direct sales in the US of our Specialty 
Pharmaceuticals products and a full 
year of Biocompatibles sales. 
Revenues were also boosted by 
higher than expected royalties 
from BeneFIX® (Factor IX) and 
Zytiga® (abiraterone acetate).
Below we summarise the key financial metrics we use to monitor business 
performance.

The only available treatment for 
toxicity associated with the use 
of the heart medicine digoxin.
Voraxaze® (glucarpidase)
Approved in the US for treating 
life-threatening toxicity that can 
occur in cancer patients with renal 
impairment who are receiving 
high-dose methotrexate therapy.
Late-stage development
Uridine triacetate
Under development by Wellstat 
Therapeutics Corporation as a 
treatment for toxicity associated 
with use of the chemotherapeutic 
5-fluorouracil. BTG has acquired 
US and EU commercial rights.
Growth strategy
We are seeking to in-license or 
acquire additional antidotes, as well 
as other products used by acute care 
and other specialist physicians.
Commercial sales
LC Bead™, DC Bead® and Bead Block®
Embolisation and drug-eluting beads 
that are used to treat patients with 
hypervascularised tumours.
Brachytherapy implants
Low-dose radioactive seeds used 
primarily to treat early-stage prostate 
cancer.
Late-stage development
Varisolve® (polidocanol endovenous 
microfoam (PEM))
A non-surgical product that has 
completed Phase III development in 
the US as a potential comprehensive 
treatment to improve both the 
symptoms and appearance of 
varicose veins.
Growth strategy
We plan to continue investing in 
clinical development of the bead 
products to expand their indicated 
uses and geographic availability. We 
are also seeking to acquire additional 
products used by interventional 
radiologists, medical oncologists 
and vascular surgeons.
Commercial sales
Existing royalty streams include 
Zytiga® (abiraterone acetate), a 
treatment for advanced prostate 
cancer marketed by the Janssen 
Pharmaceutical Companies of 
Johnson & Johnson, and the 
Two-Part Hip Cup, licensed to 
most major hip-replacement 
technology manufacturers.
Late-stage development
Lemtrada™ (alemtuzumab)
In Phase III development by Sanofi 
as a potential treatment for relapsing-
remitting multiple sclerosis.
AZD9773 (CytoFab™)
In Phase IIb development by 
AstraZeneca as a potential treatment 
for severe sepsis and/or septic 
shock.
Growth strategy
We are currently assessing options 
for the CellMed platforms and 
early-stage programmes we acquired 
with Biocompatibles. We are not 
actively seeking to develop or acquire 
products for out-licensing.
Specialty Pharmaceuticals
See page 8
The current focus within Specialty 
Pharmaceuticals is on antidote 
products that are used within 
hospitals. We market and sell our 
products directly in the US, and 
elsewhere we work with distribution 
partners.
Interventional Medicine
See page 11
Our key products are embolisation 
and drug-eluting beads used primarily 
to treat patients with liver tumours 
and brachytherapy products used 
mainly for early-stage prostate 
cancer. We assumed direct sales 
responsibility in the US for LC Bead™ 
in January 2012.
Licensing & Biotechnology
See page 13
This business area comprises 
licensed products and programmes 
and generates significant royalties for 
BTG. We out-license assets that we 
do not intend to market ourselves.
Business review Voraxaze® (glucarpidase)
Specialty Pharmaceuticals
Approved and launched in the US, 
this is the only drug which can break 
down methotrexate in the blood 
following cancer treatment. Hundreds 
of patients a year may benefit from 
this new treatment, many of whom 
are children with cancers such as 
lymphoma. Varisolve® (polidocanol 
endovenous microfoam (PEM))
Interventional Medicine
A non-surgical experimental 
treatment for varicose veins, 
that has completed Phase III 
development in the US. If approved, 
PEM could potentially transform 
this underserved market as a 
comprehensive single-product 
treatment for symptomatic and/or 
visible varicose veins.

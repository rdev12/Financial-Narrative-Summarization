For most of 2009, the European buyout market suffered  
from the fragility in the broader economic environment. 
There was an unprecedented decline in investments, 
realisations and fund raising activities caused by an 
economic slowdown across the world, the near collapse 
of the global banking system and the tightening of credit 
markets. These events resulted in deal values declining  
to levels not seen since 1996, with deal volumes falling  
to 1993 levels.
Market environment
Shareholder highlights
Our priority for the year ahead is to build on the progress 
we have made, exploring the options we now have for the 
Company that will ensure an enduring business which 
creates value for all of Candover’s investors.

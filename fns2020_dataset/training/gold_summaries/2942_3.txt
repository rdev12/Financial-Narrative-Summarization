What we do
Construction services
(excluding the Middle East)
We have a strong and selective 
construction capability in the UK 
and in Canada, focused on large, 
higher added value contracts for 
long-term customers. 
As well as creating value 
in its own right, a strong 
construction capability plays 
a key role in driving growth 
in Public Private Partnership 
(PPP) projects and in support 
services. It is fundamental 
to our ability to provide 
customers with the services 
they require, not only to 
create, but also to manage 
and operate buildings and 
infrastructure. 
Having the capabilities 
to offer design and 
construction services gives 
us a competitive advantage 
when it comes to optimising 
the whole-life cost of 
providing, maintaining and 
operating assets such as 
schools, hospitals, military 
accommodation, prisons, 
roads and railways – an 
essential requirement for 
PPP projects.

 UK building – education
Our construction capability has 
played a key role in establishing 
the strong positions we have in 
our chosen sectors of the UK 
PPP market. For example, 
Carillion is a leading supplier 
to the UK Government’s 
£65 billion Building Schools 
for the Future programme, 
signifi cant parts of which are 
being procured through PPP 
projects. Combining our design 
and construction capabilities 
with our private fi nance and 
support services skills, has 
already secured contracts for 
over 140 schools and academies 
where we are creating state-of 
the-art learning environments.

 UK building – health
Our design and construction 
capabilities are also 
fundamental to our success in 
the health sector of the PPP 
market. Carillion has won 
contracts for 20 PPP hospitals 
and other healthcare facilities, 
of which 15 are in the UK – 
including the UK’s fi rst PPP 
hospital, the Darent Valley 
Hospital in Kent – and fi ve are 
in Canada. In December 2009, 
we were selected as the 
preferred bidder for the new 
Southmead Hospital in Bristol, 
on which we have since 
achieved fi nancial close, with 
building work on the main 
hospital scheduled to begin in 
spring 2010.

 UK building – defence
Having a strong construction 
capability is also enhancing the 
development of our support 
services business in the defence 
sector. For example, our Public 
Private Partnership projects, 
such as Allenby Connaught, 
where we are rebuilding Army 
accommodation across the 
South of England, and the 
Permanent Joint Headquarters 
project in North London, both 
include long-term support 
services contracts. Being the 
leading supplier of facilities 
management and maintenance 
services for Defence Estates, 
also creates opportunities for 
our construction business. For 
example, at Catterick Garrison, 
one of many Ministry of 
Defence locations where we 
provide facilities management 
and maintenance services, 
we have carried out extensive 
building work, including a 
new leisure and sports centre.

 UK infrastructure
Our largest sectors of the UK 
infrastructure market are roads 
and railways. Current major 
contracts include upgrading the 
A1 in Yorkshire to motorway 
standards and upgrading the 
Airdrie to Bathgate rail link, 
which forms part of a 
programme to improve rail 
links in central Scotland. 
Our construction capabilities 
in these sectors are also key 
to our success in winning 
and delivering PPP road 
and rail projects, long-term 
maintenance contracts for roads 
and railways and contracts for 
the new ‘managed motorways’ 
programme. This programme 
involves the installation and 
operation of mandatory 
speed limits, together with 
hard-shoulder running, to 
improve traffi c fl ow during 
peak periods, which requires 
both construction and 
support services skills.
5
 Canada and the 
Caribbean building
In Canada and the Caribbean, 
where our businesses were 
established over 40 years ago, 
we have strong construction 
capabilities both for buildings 
and infrastructure. In Canada, 
PPP construction is growing 
strongly. Having delivered two 
of the fi rst PPP hospitals to be 
built in Canada, we have since 
won a further three major PPP 
hospital projects, which are 
now under construction. In 
December 2009, we were 
awarded one of our largest 
ever contracts in Canada to 
extend and refurbish Toronto’s 
Union Station, refl ecting 
the reputation we have 
for delivering major high-
quality projects.

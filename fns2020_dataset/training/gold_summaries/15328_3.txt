 TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC Annual Report 2014

Chairman’s statement
Strategic report: Overview Strategic report: Strategy Strategic report: Performance Governance Financial statements Other information
This has been a year of significant investment in growth for 
TalkTalk, as a result of which we have ended the year with 
nearly one million TV customers. TalkTalk Business has 
also had a very good year, delivering strong growth in a 
market where few other B2B operators are showing growth.
As a result we reported our first full year of revenue growth 
since demerger. We saw a substantial improvement in 
profitability in the second half of the year which, despite 
our investment in TV during the first half, allowed us to 
grow the dividend by the 15% we committed to in FY12. 
I am pleased to report therefore that for FY14 the Board 
has declared a final dividend of 8.00p that, in addition 
to our interim dividend of 4.00p, gives a total pay-out 
for the year of 12.00p.
These are substantial achievements that highlight the 
sustainable power of leveraging our network to deliver 
value for money products to consumers and businesses 
across the UK, while also creating value for shareholders. 
It has been another year of significant change and 
challenge for our employees, and the Board and I would 
like to thank them for their efforts and for their continuing 
commitment to TalkTalk and to our customers.
Sir Charles Dunstone
Chairman

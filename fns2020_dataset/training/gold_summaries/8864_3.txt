Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to
report a year of
further progress 
for the Group.
Particularly strong
performances by
our newer Facilities
Management and
Corporatewear
businesses have
helped us to
achieve our financial objectives
despite the impact on Drycleaning 
of the weak retail market. We have
also managed to stabilise and grow
our Apparelmaster garment rental
business after several years of
industry-wide decline and we continue
to see excellent growth from our
Stalbridge linen rental business.

Group results
Our results for the year were in line with our
expectations. Total turnover grew by 19% to £432 million
(2004: £364 million), while turnover, excluding costs
recharged to customers in our Facilities Management
division, increased by 31% to £364 million (2004: £278
million). Excluding acquisitions and costs recharged to
customers, underlying revenue rose by 4%.
The Group interest charge rose to £8.4 million (2004:
£5.5 million), reflecting the £86 million expenditure on
acquisitions, net of disposals, over the last two years.
As a result of our acquisitions, amortisation of intangible
assets increased substantially. We also incurred net
exceptional costs of £0.6 million (2004: £2.0 million);
these comprised restructuring costs of £4.0 million; a
£1.0 million provision for environmental and asbestos
remediation work and exceptional income of £4.4 million
relating to the gain on the sale of ten retail properties
and a textile rental facility. The restructuring expenditure
arose as we integrated our acquired businesses and
rationalised back office functions. This restructuring has
already led to a saving of some £500,000 in 2005 and is
expected to yield annual savings of £1.3 million from
2006. In addition, we rationalised the number of
premises that Johnson Hospitality Services trades 
from and incurred additional costs as we integrated 
the business under the management of Stalbridge 
Linen Services.
Under UK GAAP, reported profit before taxation rose by
2% to £15.7 million.
The Group has prepared its consolidated financial
statements to 31st December 2005 under UK GAAP,
supplemented with summary IFRS financial information,
rather than under IFRS as previously indicated. This is to
comply with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended
November 2004) and is a result of the 2005 accounting
year commencing on 26th December 2004, i.e. prior to
the IFRS adoption date of 1st January 2005. 
The only significant difference in the Group profit and
loss account is the treatment of amortisation of goodwill
and intangibles. Therefore, the adjusted profit (before
amortisation, restructuring and environmental costs and
exceptional items) under IFRS is nearly identical to that
reported under UK GAAP. Summary IFRS information has
been included in note 37 of the Financial Statements. 
To aid comparability with our peers who will be reporting
under IFRS, the following numbers used in this
commentary are IFRS based unless otherwise stated.
Adjusted profit before taxation rose by 15% to £28.1 million
(2004: £24.4 million) and adjusted fully diluted earnings
per share by 9% to 33.8 pence (2004: 30.9 pence).
Finances
In July we established a new £200 million five year
Revolving Credit Facility with a syndicate of seven banks.
This was agreed on more favourable terms than our
previous facility, which began to amortise at the end of
June 2005.
The Group’s net debt at the year end was £137 million
(2004: £74 million). This £63 million increase reflected
our net cash spend on acquisitions of £56.2 million,
continuing capital expenditure and a £3.4 million rise in
our working capital. Capital expenditure is expected to
continue at a substantial level through 2006, as
previously advised, but then decrease substantially as
our major IT and building programmes are completed.
The interest charge was covered over four times by
adjusted operating profit. 
Dividend
The Board is recommending an increased final dividend
of 15.0 pence per share (2004: 14.3 pence). Together with
the interim dividend of 4.4 pence paid in October , this
makes a total for the year of 19.4 pence (2004: 18.5 pence),
a rise of 5%. It is the Board’s intention to continue to
pursue a progressive dividend policy while maintaining a
prudent level of cover.

Operations
All the business-to-business divisions of the Group
performed well during the year, with Corporatewear 
and Facilities Management making particularly strong
progress. In the Rental division, Johnsons Apparelmaster’s
revenues stabilised after several years of decline;
Stalbridge maintained its excellent growth record and
Johnson Hospitality Services has begun to benefit from
its integration into this successful business. In a poor
trading climate for high street retailers in general, the
Drycleaning division experienced reductions in both 
like-for-like sales and profits. The Chief Executive and 
our divisional Managing Directors provide a fuller
commentary on these and other developments in their
Review on pages 8 to 19 of this report.
Acquisitions 
During the year we made eight acquisitions for a total
value of £62.2 million, including deferred consideration.
The acquisitions continued our strategy of refocusing the
Group towards markets which offer higher growth
business-to-business services, with strong recurring
revenue streams, hence reducing our exposure to our
traditional and more cyclical markets in garment rental
and drycleaning.  
All the acquisitions are meeting or exceeding our initial
expectations.

Outlook
The Group remains focused on further developing its
business-to-business operations which have high levels of
recurring revenues and real growth potential.
Our textile offering is comprehensive and unique, while
our expanded Facilities Management activities now cover
both the commercial and retail sectors. The strong
business model we have developed allows us to exploit
the cross-selling opportunities that exist within and
between our core activities and to deliver sustained
growth to the top and bottom line.
With our Corporatewear and Facilities Management
businesses performing well in growing markets and with
improving conditions in the workwear rental sector we
are confident in the future of the Group. 
Trading conditions for our retail Drycleaning business
remain unpredictable.
Subject to the comments above, we remain well placed to
deliver another satisfactory outcome for the year as a
whole.

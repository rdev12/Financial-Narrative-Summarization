Group 2010 operational performance
During 2010 we remained focused on maintaining tight controls 
over costs in all our businesses. Headcount at 31 December 2010 
of 2,004 was in line with the prior year (2009: 2,003) as we flexed 
labour where necessary and permitted limited selective hiring of 
permanent personnel only where merited by business activity 
levels. Significant increases in raw material prices were seen during 
the year, most notably in steel and oil derivative products, and local 
management were diligent in passing these on to customers in 
order to protect our gross margins. 
Throughout 2010 we have continued to reassess and flex our 
global production footprint to optimise our margins and improve 
our customer offering. The conversion of our Chinese 
manufacturing operation to a sourcing operation in February 2010 
has allowed us greater flexibility in obtaining the lowest cost, 
highest quality product. Production levels at the Group’s Mexican 
operation have been significantly increased during the year and we 
vacated our site at Tipton in the West Midlands. Building work has 
started in Sioux Falls, South Dakota for a planned expansion to 
consolidate our Sioux Falls door hardware and balance 
manufacturing businesses onto a single site. This is expected to be 
completed during 2011.
We have continued our focus on tight management of working 
capital. Despite increased turnover we successfully increased our 
stock turn in 2010 and reduced our investment in inventory held at 
the year end. During the year a number of our customers ceased 
trading, however vigilant management of customer credit risks 
throughout the year, starting at the point of sale, meant that bad 
debts written off amounted to only 0.1 per cent. of sales (2009: 0.3 
per cent.). 
We continue to promote the financial strength of the Group to the 
credit insurers of our major suppliers in order to optimise the credit 
terms that we receive from our supplier base and to work closely 
with our customer base to ensure we understand their balance 
sheet position and creditworthiness.
Financial performance in the period
For the year ended 31 December 2010, compared with the prior 
year:
Sales
Total sales of £266.2 million increased by 10.2 per cent. from prior 
year (2009: £241.6 million). In constant currency terms on a like for 
like basis, total sales increased in the year by 12.4 per cent. 
Margins
Despite challenging trading conditions and increasing raw material 
costs, the Group’s gross profit margin increased to 34.9 per cent. 
from 33.3 per cent. in 2009. The Underlying operating margin for 
the Group increased from 10.6 per cent. in 2009 to 12.6 per cent. 
in 2010. 
The Group continued to flex its cost base in line with demand such 
that the Dropthrough Margin on incremental sales in the year was 
32.8 per cent.

Annual Report & Accounts 2010
During 2010 the Group repaid £21. 1 million of  ⁄
debt, to bring the total debt repayments made 
since the refinancing in July 2009 to £41.4 million.
Cash flow
Despite the 10.2 per cent. increase in sales, in 2010 the Group 
generated £1.7 million cash from net working capital reductions 
(2009: £10.7 million). These reductions, combined with the 
increased operating profit generated by the Group, meant that the 
net cash inflow from operating activities of £36.3 million remained 
broadly in line with prior year (2009: £36.5 million). 
Operating Cash Conversion, being the proportion of Underlying 
operating profit converted into cash, exceeded 100 per cent. at 
105 per cent. in 2010 (2009: 142 per cent.). 
Capital expenditure increased by 57 per cent. to £3.5 million (2009: 
£2.2 million). 
Net debt position
During 2010 the Group repaid £21.1 million of debt, to bring the 
total debt repayments made since the refinancing in July 2009 to 
£41.4 million. 
At 31 December 2010 the Group’s Underlying Net Debt, was £94.7 
million, which was £21.5 million lower than prior year (2009: £116.2 
million), despite adverse exchange rate movements increasing net 
debt by £2.0 million. 
Average Underlying Net Debt during the year was £113.9 million 
(2009: £135.6 million). Under the IFRS definition, which reduces 
debt by the unamortised bank fees, net debt at the year end was 
£91.7 million (2009: £111.0 million).
Banking
At 31 December the Group had headroom against its banking 
covenants ranging from 47 per cent. to 75 per cent. and the Board 
remains confident that the Group will continue to operate within its 
banking covenants as set out in the current banking facility 
agreements, which expire in July 2012. 
The Group’s key banking performance metric, being the  
proportion of net debt to Underlying EBITDA, at the year end  
was 2.38x (2009: 3.66x), calculated on the same basis as the 
banking covenants.
Defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit schemes
The Group’s principal defined benefit pension scheme and post 
retirement healthcare benefit scheme is operated in the US. The 
pension scheme is closed to new entrants and post retirement 
healthcare benefit contributions are capped.
At 31 December 2010, the defined benefit obligation for all Group 
pension and post retirement healthcare benefit schemes was 
£18.9 million (2009: £17.4 million) and the schemes had plan assets 
of £11.6 million (2009: £9.9 million), resulting in a slightly reduced 
net deficit on the schemes of £7.3 million (2009: £7.5 million).

Profits
Underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and 
amortisation were £40.2 million (2009: £32.3 million). 
Underlying operating profit increased by 31.6 per cent. to £33.7 
million (2009: £25.6 million). On a constant currency basis this 
represents an increase of 30.4 per cent. over the prior year. 
Underlying administrative expenses increased by £4.2 million or 7.7 
per cent. to £59.1 million (2009: £54.9 million). Administration costs 
included higher freight, commission and management incentive 
costs associated with the increased levels of activity and higher 
legal costs associated with defence of Intellectual Property rights.
Net finance costs decreased by £0.6 million to £12.0 million (2009: 
£12.6 million), reflecting reduced debt levels. The 2009 interest rate 
benefited from the lower margins payable on the Group’s facilities prior 
to the refinancing in July 2009. Net cash interest paid of £9.3 million 
(2009: £10.5 million) was 12 per cent. lower than that paid in 2009.
Fair value losses on financial instruments increased by £0.9 million 
in 2010 due to out-of-the-money interest rate hedges taken out in 
2007 that did not expire until 30 September 2010. During the year 
the Group entered into a number of interest rate swap transactions 
which had the economic effect of fixing the Group’s cost of funds, 
before the applicable margin, at between 1.85 and 2.045 per cent. 
until July 2012.
Underlying profit before taxation was 56.1 per cent. higher at £24.5 
million (2009: £15.7 million).
Earnings per share
Underlying earnings per share increased by 3.67 pence or 39.1 per 
cent. to 13.06 pence (2009: 9.39 pence). Basic earnings per share 
increased from 0.32 pence in 2009 to 5.43 pence. 
Exceptional costs
Exceptional costs of £0.4 million (2009: £2.1 million) were incurred 
during the period, principally in connection with the outsourcing of 
further activity from the UK to China and the General Meeting held 
in February 2010.
Taxation
The tax charge increased to £2.5 million in 2010 (2009: tax  
credit £1.1 million). Excluding the effect of the change in tax  
rates on deferred tax assets and the adjustments in respect of 
prior periods, the Underlying tax rate on the Underlying profit 
before taxation was 32 per cent. (2009: 28 per cent.). The 
Underlying tax rate increased during 2010 due to the geographic 
mix of profit growth. 
The Underlying cash tax rate in the year was 9 per cent. (2009: 14 
per cent.) and is lower than the Underlying tax rate due to historic 
losses. The Underlying cash tax rate is expected to trend towards 
the Underlying tax rate over the coming years.
Financial position
During the year the Group continued to focus on the tight 
management of working capital, operational cash generation and 
the reduction of net debt.

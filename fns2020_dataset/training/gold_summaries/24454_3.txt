 Chairman’s Statement
A very productive year for Gresham House
Gresham House’s 
development as 
a specialist asset 
manager has 
continued in the year 
and I am pleased to 
advise shareholders 
that the Company 
continues to deliver 
well against our 
stated strategy.
Activity in the year
Activity in the year has highlighted 
the progress made by the 
management team, with assets 
under management growing 
50% through both organic and 
acquisition activity. Each of these 
elements of growth has been 
approached in a diligent manner 
to ensure that the investment 
management contracts acquired 
and funds launched are in line 
with the Company’s stated strategy 
to operate in alternative and 
illiquid asset classes, which aim 
to generate superior returns for 
clients and shareholders over the 
longer term.

Chairman’s Statement  Gresham House plc Report and Accounts 2016 
 
Results
The Group has reduced its adjusted 
operating loss to £1.6 million in the 
year from a £3.1 million loss last 
year, demonstrating great progress 
on the journey towards profitability. 
We continue to build the Group from 
a solid balance sheet and have the 
ability to approach opportunities from 
a strong position. 
This performance is notable against 
a background of difficult economic 
and political conditions during 2016, 
following Britain’s vote to leave the 
European Union in June and the US 
election results in November. The 
weakening of sterling and slow growth 
prospects for markets in general has 
impacted many companies. We are 
still operating in uncertain times, 
however the Board is keen to ensure 
that the business continues to be 
managed in a risk focussed manner. 
We are not materially exposed to 
foreign currency movements or 
interest rates and are using the 
current conditions to ensure that we 
continue to invest in the value driven 
areas of the market. 
The management team
We have experienced some changes 
at the Board level in the year and I 
would like to take this opportunity to 
thank Michael Phillips on behalf of 
shareholders and the Board for his 
efforts in building Gresham House 
and his important role in the early 
stages of the Company’s development. 
Mike stepped down from his role as 
Strategic Development Director at the 
end of the year to focus on his other 
business interests. 
Shareholders will recall that we 
announced on 19 April 2016 that 
Kevin Acton would be joining us as 
Finance Director. Kevin took up his 
position on 6 June 2016 and very 
much hit the ground running; he has 
been a very valuable addition to the 
team and it has been a great pleasure 
working with him since then.
The Gresham House team has 
grown in the year to match the 
management’s ambitions and 
provide a sound infrastructure to 
support the new funds launched 
and the investment management 
contracts acquired. The hard work 
and dedication of the whole team 
has driven the business to where it is 
today and I believe that we have the 
right people in place to continue to 
deliver against our strategic goals.
Shareholders
I am also pleased to welcome a 
number of new, long-term strategic 
shareholders to our share register in 
the year. Our supportive shareholder 
base has enabled the Company to use 
its balance sheet to develop to date 
and we are excited about the prospect 
of continuing to grow the business 
with this solid support behind us. 
The announcement on 21 February 
2017 and issuance of ordinary shares 
to the Royal County of Berkshire 
Pension Fund (“Berkshire”), highlight 
that Gresham House is building its 
name as an established specialist asset 
manager and becoming attractive to 
a wider audience of investors. We 
also look forward to working with 
Berkshire as the cornerstone investor 
in our new Gresham House British 
Strategic Investment Fund, in which 
we are already getting interest from 
local authority pension funds.
Annual General Meeting
Our Annual General Meeting this 
year is being held at 11.00am on 18 
May 2017 at Travers Smith, 10 Snow 
Hill, London, EC1A 2AL . Given 
how much has happened during the 
year and subsequently the Board 
would encourage shareholders to 
attend and hear directly from the 
management team on the progress 
to date. I therefore hope to see as 
many of you as possible there.
Outlook
Overall it has been a very productive 
year for the Company and we have 
the ambition to deliver further 
growth in 2017. We will continue to 
harness our existing relationships 
and grow the business in line with our 
stated strategy and I look forward to 
updating you with further progress 
later in the year.

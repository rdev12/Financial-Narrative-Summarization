Syndicate profit distributions
Profit distributions from Helios Underwriting’s 
(“HUW”) portfolio of syndicates continue to be 
made by reference to the traditional three-year 
Lloyd’s accounting. Using this measure of 
performance, Helios Underwriting’s portfolio 
significantly outperformed the Lloyd’ s result 
as a percentage of capacity on the 2012 
account at 31 December 2014 with a profit 
of 13.01% (Lloyd’ s: 11.93%) and is estimated 
to outperform Lloyd’ s on the 2013 account with 
a profit of 8.5% at the mid-point estimate 
after eight quarters (Lloyd’s: 4.8%).
At this early stage of development on the 2014 
account, a complete set of published estimates 
is not available until the end of May 2015. In 
March 2015 Hampden Agencies updated its 
forecast profit for the 2014 year from its initial 
range of 0%–7.5% to 2.5%–10% for clients 
of Hampden Agencies on average. 
2012 year of account produced a profit of 
£2,744,000, representing a profit of 13.01% 
on 2012 capacity
Over 87% of capacity supporting 
syndicates rated either “AA”, “A” or “B”

Chief Executive’s review continued 
Strategic objective and 
risk management strategy
2014 has been a year during which we have 
carried through our stated strategy. The returns 
give us confidence that the strategy is working, 
under difficult market conditions, for the benefit 
of the shareholders.
During the year Helios successfully purchased 
four vehicles and, following the year end, were 
able to purchase three more with a fourth 
subject to completion. This succession of 
vehicles purchased exceeded our expectations. 
However at the time of going to press 
a quieter period seems to be upon us. Given 
the age profile of potential vendors it seems 
reasonable to assume that mortality will ensure 
further sales, although a satisfactory price can 
never be guaranteed. It is important to point 
out that the main threat to our strategy is that 
we are unable to secure sufficient purchases 
at acceptable prices.
Our strategic objective remains to underwrite 
at Lloyd’s with superior capital efficiency, 
lower risk and higher return. In order to 
achieve this the Company announced in 
2012 that it was purchasing quota share 
reinsurance. One of the reasons it did so 
was in response to deteriorating market 
conditions. These conditions have continued 
to worsen and we have re-examined our 
strategy to ensure that it remains appropriate. 
I am pleased to say that we believe that 
is the case. The essential features of the 
strategy constitute an increased purchase 
of quota share to 70%, from 50% initially, 
on the youngest year of account. The quota 
share cover is collateralised by letters of 
credit up to the amount of the indemnity. 
HUW’s 2014 underwriting result
The traditional method for comparing the 
performance of competing (re)insurance 
companies is an analysis of the combined 
ratio, which is the sum of net claims and 
expenses divided by net earned premium. 
I am delighted to report that the combined 
ratio of Helios Underwriting’s portfolio for 
2014 was 87.6% with the underwriting 
result benefiting from another benign year 
for catastrophe losses. Using this measure 
of performance, Helios Underwriting 
outperformed both the Lloyd’ s market combined 
ratio of 88.1% (by 0.5 percentage points) and 
a peer group of eleven competitor insurance 
and reinsurance companies whose average 
combined ratio was 93.1% (by 5.5 percentage 
points). Helios Underwriting has outperformed 
both the Lloyd’s market and the competitor 
group in each of the past four financial years. 
HUW’s capital position
Net tangible assets per share fell marginally 
by 3% during 2014, principally as a result 
of the four acquisitions made in the year. 
Year-end net tangible assets were £6.7m 
(£6.9m at year end 2013) with the balance 
of Lloyd’s minimum capital requirement 
in November 2014 of £13.1m (£11.1m 
in November 2013, being supplied by 
letters of credit from quota share 
reinsurance capital providers from 
which we benefit from both a fee 
and profit commission).

Chief Executive’s review continued 
We retain the maximum possible exposure 
to older, more mature years of account which, 
generally speaking, show a consistent pattern 
of improvement and, in our view, have a lower 
risk attaching to them although, for example, 
at the time of going to press, 2014 still 
contains significant unprotected (by us) risk. 
Furthermore we will receive an annual fee 
from this arrangement as well as a profit 
commission if appropriate. 
I am pleased to report that the quota share 
arrangement has been renewed for the 2015 
account with all three reinsurers.
To further protect the Company from 
underwriting losses, Helios purchases regular 
stop loss reinsurance from Hampden Insurance 
PCC (Guernsey) Limited, a Guernsey Protected 
Cell which is reinsured 100% with a very large 
A+ rated international reinsurer. 
We buy the maximum available to us with 
the ultimate aim that all vehicles are covered, 
although for various reasons some are not 
covered in the short term; for example, 
quotes might not be available for a recent 
LLV purchase, in which case we will run 
that risk until such time as it can be included. 
We buy cover in excess of a 10% of overall 
premium limit (“OPL”) deductible, which is 
designed to contain any possible loss at 
an acceptable figure.
It is our judgement that should a single loss 
or series of losses strike the insurance market 
then the strategy outlined above will position us 
satisfactorily for the opportunities which would 
no doubt become apparent. However, if the 
timing of those losses are further out than 
might be expected, this strategy should 
continue to produce satisfactory profits 
within an acceptable risk profile.
Classes of business for 2015
The final important piece of the risk 
management matrix is to ruthlessly 
focus on quality syndicates which have 
traditionally outperformed in difficult times. 
Helios Underwriting’ s portfolio for 2015 continues 
to provide a good spread of business across 
managing agents and classes of business with 
motor and liability providing a balance to the 
catastrophe-exposed reinsurance and property 
business, as well as contributing through 
diversification to lower capital requirements. 
The two largest classes of business remain 
reinsurance and US dollar property insurance. 
Currently, the balance of risk and reward has 
now shifted from net sellers of reinsurance to 
net buyers of reinsurance. Reinsurance exposure 
based on syndicate business plans has therefore 
reduced for 2015 to 24.0% from 30.9% in 2014 
while US$ property insurance exposure has 
increased to 17.6% from 16.0% in 2014.
We continue to actively increase our exposure 
to higher quality syndicates and ended the year 
with 54% of our capacity supporting syndicates 
rated either “AA” (excellent) or “A” (very good), 
the top two out of four syndicate ratings 
according to Hampden. HUW’s portfolio for 
2015 continues to provide a good spread of 
business across managing agents and classes 
of business. 24.6% of the capacity is in the 
two syndicates rated “AA” by Hampden 
Agencies, being Syndicates 609 and 2791, 
while Kiln Syndicate 510, rated “B”, is the 
largest holding at 17.1% of capacity. The 
top ten syndicates comprise 82.5% of the 
portfolio. Apart from a small participation on 
a life syndicate through a Nameco acquisition, 
one new syndicate was joined for 2015 
which writes catastrophe-exposed US middle 
market commercial insurance risks.
In our view there is a correlation between 
quality and the price these syndicates are 
likely to achieve at auction, which leaves 
us exposed to a drop in value which would 
certainly occur if there were a very significant, 
market-changing catastrophe. Our weighted 
average value of capacity is £7.8m and it 
is not inconceivable that this could reduce 
significantly in a major crisis. Shareholders 
should be aware that such a reduction would 
affect our adjusted net asset value at least in 
the short term.

Principal risks and uncertainties
The principal risks and uncertainties to the 
Group’s future cash flows will arise from the 
Group’s participation in the results of Lloyd’s 
syndicates. These risks and uncertainties are 
mostly managed by the syndicate managing 
agents. The Group’s role in managing these 
risks and uncertainties, in conjunction with 
Hampden Agencies Limited, is limited 
to a selection of syndicate participations, 
monitoring the performance of the syndicates 
and the purchase of appropriate member 
level reinsurance.
The Group benefits from strategic collateralised 
quota share arrangements on its 2013, 2014 
and 2015 years of account.
The 2013 year of account arrangement is in 
respect of 50% of its business with Bermudan 
reinsurer XL Re Limited (“XL Re”, part of global 
NYSE quoted insurer XL Group plc) through 
Hampden Insurance PCC (Guernsey) Limited 
– Cell 6 (“Cell 6”), a special purpose vehicle.
The 2014 year of account has a strategic 
collateralised quota share arrangement in 
respect of 50% of its business with XL Re, 
12.45% with Bermudan reinsurer Everest 
Reinsurance Bermuda Limited (“Everest”, 
part of global NYSE quoted insurer Everest 
Re Group, Ltd) and 7.55% with Guernsey 
reinsurer Polygon Insurance Co Limited 
(“Polygon”) through Cell 6.
The Group anticipates these arrangements 
as strategic long-term relationships. However, 
the contracts are annually renewable and the 
Group has a contingency plan in place in the 
event of non-renewal under both normal and 
adverse market conditions. Further information 
on risk management is disclosed in Note 3 
to the Financial Statements.
The biggest single risk faced by insurers is 
deficient loss reserves combined with inadequate 
pricing, which accounts for 44.3% of insurance 
failures according to AM Best in its latest 
review of insurer impairments in the US. 
Particularly for casualty business, where 
the period or “tail" for a claim to be paid may 
be many years after the receipt of premium, 
the feedback loop between reserving and 
pricing is critical. Under-reserving leads to 
inadequate pricing based on false profitability 
which then can be exacerbated by multiple 
years of underwriting losses before pricing 
can be corrected. Under-reserving usually 
arises due to unforeseen events such as 
legislative, social or economic changes but 
can also be due to risks which underwriters 
are aware of but which have not been fully 
priced into the premium charged.
Rapid growth is the third largest reason for 
insurer impairments, accounting for 12.3% 
of impairments, while investment problems 
(6.6%) and catastrophe losses (7.1%) play 
a much smaller role. Rapid growth can be 
associated with moving into new lines of 
business where there is limited or no prior 
experience and therefore could cause 
both increased pricing and reserving risk. 
Cyber liability has the potential to fall into 
this category if not managed carefully. 
The final important piece of 
the risk management matrix 
is to ruthlessly focus on 
quality syndicates which have 
traditionally outperformed 
in difficult times. Annual report and financial statements 2014 | Helios Underwriting plc | 07 S Strategic report
Chief Executive’s review continued 
Excessive growth in a softening/soft market 
when compared with peers is usually a warning 
signal since that growth is usually, by definition, 
accompanied by underwriting business at 
a lower rate than the previous carrier.
HUW approaches the management of portfolio 
risk by diversifying across classes of business, 
syndicates and managing agents and, with 
the advice of Hampden Agencies, understanding 
the cycle management and reserving strategy 
of each syndicate as well as the rate environment. 
We also assess the downside in the event of 
a major loss through monitoring the aggregate 
losses estimated by managing agents to realistic 
disaster scenarios (“RDSs") prescribed by Lloyd’ s. 
Risk is assessed in the context of potential 
return with catastrophe exposure being actively 
managed dependent on market conditions.
The RDS events comprise 16 compulsory 
events including a Florida hurricane, a Californian 
earthquake and a Japanese earthquake, together 
with six scenarios subject to de minimis reporting 
of the more difficult to model liability or political 
risk scenarios. The largest losses modelled 
for 2015 remain $125bn for a Florida windstorm 
in both Miami Dade and Pinellas. The largest 
earthquake loss modelled remains in California 
with a $78bn industry loss for both Los Angeles 
and San Francisco. Syndicates are also required 
by Lloyd’s to report two further realistic events 
(Alternative A and B) that represent potential 
material impact to the syndicate.
HUW’s largest modelled exposures net of 
reinsurance at syndicate level as a percentage 
of gross premiums have reduced for 2015 
compared with 2014 before taking into account 
HUW’s stop loss reinsurance and quota 
share reinsurance protections. This reflects 
a reduced reinsurance exposure which is 
consistent with the reduction in margins 
for peak zone catastrophe exposures. 
The largest for 2015 is the larger of two 
windstorm events consisting of a north-east 
US hurricane, immediately followed by a 
South Carolina hurricane at 28.2% of gross 
premium, net of reinsurance (32.2% in 2014). 
The next largest is the Gulf of Mexico 
windstorm at 25.1% net (30.4% in 2014).
All RDS exposures as a percentage of gross 
premium are within the 30% net of reinsurance 
Hampden Agencies guidelines.
Corporate, social and 
environmental responsibility
The Group aims to meet the expectations 
of its shareholders and other stakeholders 
in recognising, measuring and managing 
the impacts of its business activities. The 
majority of the Group’s business activities 
are carried out by the syndicates in which 
activities, including employment of syndicate 
staff, are the responsibility of the syndicate 
managing agents. Each managing agent 
also has responsibility for the environmental 
activities of each syndicate although, by their 
nature, syndicates do not produce significant 
environmental emissions.
For the reasons described above, the Board 
of Directors does not consider it appropriate 
to monitor or report any performance 
indicators in relation to corporate, 
social or environmental matters.
Outlook
2014 has shown that our strategy works 
under current conditions. We aim to do 
more of the same for 2015. We can see 
encouraging possibilities under most 
circumstances, but the threat remains 
that the satisfactory flow of target vehicles 
either dries up or the price to acquire 
them becomes unaffordable. We believe 
neither is likely but the possibility remains.

Xchanging  
Annual report and accounts 2010
Overview 
In 2010, Xchanging’s revenue increased by 4.0% to £780.6 million, 
as new business of £73.7 million and acquisitions were partially 
o f f s e t 	 b y 	 l e a k a g e 	 f r o m 	 e x i s t i n g 	 c u s t o m e r s .	
Our underlying operating profit rose by 5.3% to £67.3 million, 
helped by acquisitions and by contract settlements and consultancy 
income. Although it is in the nature of our business to see such 
items each year, in the interests of clarity we believe it is helpful at 
this 	 time 	 to 	 identify 	 them. 	 Excluding 	 these 	 items, 	 adjusted 	 operating	
profit was 0.8% lower at £55.5 million. Net cash ended slightly up 
on the year at £24.8 million.
After amortisation of intangibles and a significant adjustment  
to goodwill related to the Cambridge business, it is disappointing  
to have to report a statutory loss for the year of £55.6 million. 
Whilst the problematic parts of the Cambridge business have been 
the focus of discussion in 2010, we have also made positive progress 
in other parts of the Group. We are now the largest independent 
investment account processor in Germany following further new

Cambridge 
Cambridge gives us a strategically significant presence in India, 
a d d i t i o n a l 	 t e c h n o l o g y 	 e x p e r t i s e 	 a n d 	 s o m e 	 i m p o r t a n t 	 i n t e r n a t i o n a l	
customers. However, it is clear that the cost of the acquisition in 
terms of profitability, cash flow and management distraction has 
been significant and it has set back Xchanging’s development. The 
business overall, which in 2010 accounted for 17.9% of our revenue 
and 3.2% of adjusted operating profit, underperformed during the 
y e a r 	 a n d 	 i t 	 i s 	 u n l i k e l y 	 t h a t 	 t h e 	 b e n e fi t s 	 w e 	 e x p e c t e d 	 a t 	 t h e 	 t i m e 	 o f	
the acquisition will be fully realised. The recession had a part to play, 
preventing customers placing new business due to pressures on 
discretionary spend. 
The Cambridge business in India has performed well, both 
operationally and financially, and has given us a significant 
low-cost production base. This supports our strategic aim to 
increase offshoring and reduce our structural cost base. However, 
the Australian business has been less successful and the US 
has significantly underperformed, with the ITO and workers’ 
compensation business lines, which are heavily dependent on the 
US economy, severely hit by volume reductions, price pressures and 
competition. 
One of our critical actions for 2011 is therefore to stem Cambridge’s 
losses and restrict its cash outflow. We have initiated a plan to 
address the issues around Cambridge, including the transfer of the 
pr ofitable 	 and 	 cash-generating 	 businesses 	 to 	 Xchanging 	 and 	 an 	 exit 	
from those areas that do not fit into our strategy. We will report on 
our progress during 2011. 
Whilst these actions will lead to performance improvement in time, 
we believe it right to recognise a reduction in the value of goodwill 
which arose on the acquisition. The goodwill impairment reflects 
Cambridge’s substantial deviation from the original business case. 
It is not generating sufficient cash flow to support the valuation 
nor, based on what we currently know, is it likely to do so in the 
foreseeable future.
Operational performance
Our business structure
Since 2009 we have managed our business along regional lines, in 
part 	 due 	 to 	 the 	 expansion 	 of 	 our 	 business 	 following 	 the 	 Cambridge	
acquisition. We are now introducing to our structure an increasing 
focus on four global sectors: Insurance services, Financial services, 
Technology, and Procurement and HR. In addition to presenting the 
financial information on a regional basis in note 4 to the accounts 
we have also reported the information for each sector and set out 
our performance review by business sector. 
In revenue terms, our Insurance services, Financial services and 
Procurement and HR sectors are relatively evenly balanced. Although 
smaller, our Technology business has been growing in both strategic 
importance and size and offers significant potential for the future. 
Sector performance
Insurance services 
Overall revenue decreased by 2.2% to £258.0 million (FY 2009: 
£263.8 million) and adjusted operating profit rose by 12.8% to 
£33.0 million (FY 2009: £29.3 million). Adjusted operating profit 
margins improved to 12.8% (FY 2009: 11.1%). 
The revenue decline was driven by the workers’ compensation 
businesses in the US and Australia, which underperformed due 
to volume declines. In the highly competitive US market, this 
underperformance was accentuated by customer losses, including 
the California Insurance Guarantee Association (CIGA), and in 
Australia by lower bonus revenue amounts. 
The majority of our insurance business is in the UK and this business 
performed strongly. Margins also improved, benefiting from 
the 2009 restructuring carried out in the UK, which generated 
productivity savings.
In Australia, the impact of a loss-making contract was offset  
by strong performances elsewhere.
We won new business in the year, adding a further contract  
with Aon Australia’s Risk Solutions business, initially for two years,

with Aon (see page 22).
We are restructuring the businesses in the US and Australia  
and will divert resources to those areas of the business where  
our competitive position is strongest. We will then build globally  
on the strengths of the UK business.  20

Financial services
Revenue from Financial services rose by 15.9% to £194.8 million  
(FY 2009: £168.0 million), and adjusted operating profit decreased 
by 25.5% to £11.3 million (FY 2009: £15.1 million). Adjusted 
operating margins fell to 5.8% (FY 2009: 9.0%).
The main drivers of the revenue growth in the year were twofold. 
We completed the migration of the FondsServiceBank accounts 
onto the Fondsdepot Bank (FDB) platform, driving additional volume 
through this Enterprise Partnership. We also added investment 
accounts from SEB Bank, SEB Asset Management, VERITAS 
INVESTMENT TRUST, Goethaer Versicherung and OnVista Bank.  
The second half of the year also saw a first contribution from the 
Kedrios Enterprise Partnership. 
Transaction volumes in securities processing and fund administration 
remained low compared to previous years following the global 
financial crisis. However, towards the end of the year the market 
saw some signs of revival with a higher number of Initial Public 
Offerings and corporate actions (such as rights issues).
There were two one-off contract settlement payments in the year. 
One was due to the acquisition of one customer by another. The 
second was due to modification of a customer’s contract terms. 
During the year we established a new Enterprise Partnership 
in Italy with the Kedrios subsidiary of SIA-SSB. This Enterprise 
P a r t n e r s h i p 	 c o m b i n e s 	 o u r 	 e x p e r t i s e 	 i n 	 s e c u r i t i e s 	 p r o c e s s i n g 	 a n d	
investment account administration with the Kedrios strength in fund 
administration in the Italian market. This business has, however, 
underperformed and platform migration is proving challenging.  
We will address these issues in 2011 but there will continue to be an 
adverse effect on financial performance in 2011, with an anticipated 
loss in the order of €4 million to €5 million. 
Technology
Technology sector revenues rose by 24.7% to £116.2 million  
(FY 2009: £93.2 million) and adjusted operating profit increased by 
25.1% to £17.4 million (FY 2009: £13.9 million). Adjusted operating 
margins were maintained at 15.0% (FY 2009: 14.9%).
Our Technology business overall performed well during the year 
with particularly strong growth in the UK. This was partly offset by 
a decline in discretionary IT spend in the US and Asia Pacific markets 
affecting ITO revenues. The outlook for the Asia Pacific region  
looks improved.
In June we acquired Data Integration (DI), one of the UK’s leading 
networking, security and communication technology providers.  
The acquisition has strengthened our technology capabilities and 
also brought an important UK customer base.
The new capabilities that came with DI were instrumental in 
securing two contracts with Gatwick Airport, launching a strong 
new strategic relationship. 
We delivered new technology services and systems to the London 
Metal 	 Exchange, 	 deepening 	 our 	 existing 	 r elationship 	 with 	 this	
important customer.
Illustrating the market trend to seek outsourcing in order to meet 
regulatory requirements, we launched, in partnership with hardware 
and software providers, a data management service that meets 
Solvency II regulations.
In the US, our ITO business continued to suffer from competitive 
pressures and declining revenues and profitability. This Cambridge 
business will be included in the strategic review of our US 
operations.
Procurement and HR
Procurement and HR revenue fell by 6.1% to £211.6 million  
(FY 2009: £225.2 million) and adjusted operating profit fell by 
34.4% to £11.1 million (FY 2009: £16.9 million). Adjusted operating 
margins fell to 5.2% (FY 2009: 7.5%).
The decline in the year was mainly attributable to two factors. 
Procurement revenues fell as government spending reductions 
affected key customers, leading to lower labour volumes. In HR 
services, revenues declined owing to contracts not being renewed in 
2009 and 2010. 
We won a five-year multinational contract with the pallet and 
container pooling services company CHEP Europe to manage  
£75 million of spend per annum. This contract demonstrates  
our ability to win cross-border business.

Action plan for 2011
We did not see the revenue growth we would have liked during 
2010 and our profit was helped by a number of non-recurring items. 
We recognise the need to achieve greater revenue growth in 2011 
and beyond, as well as to improve our operating margins through 
cost initiatives. Improving profitability will in turn increase our cash 
generation and value for our shareholders.
To achieve these improvements, we have developed a series of 
actions in four areas: strategic and intrinsic value review, operational 
improvements, revenue growth and cash flow and funding.  
A number of these actions are already under way.
Strategic and intrinsic value review
As the first part of our plan, we have conducted a root and 
branch review of our entire business portfolio. From this we have 
identified our businesses with unsatisfactory returns, including 
the underperforming parts of Cambridge and Kedrios. We also 
examined 	 the 	 value 	 cr eation 	 and 	 sharing 	 models 	 in 	 each 	 of 	 our	
Enterprise Partnerships to assess their attractiveness. 
This process has, in addition, enabled us to develop a clear view  
of the intrinsic value of each business and of the Group overall. 
We believe we can create value for shareholders by addressing 
our underperforming businesses, either through operational 
improvements or by changes in our portfolio of businesses  
which may result in some disposals. 
We also need to inculcate a culture of value creation and a focus  
on economic returns. Our operational improvement plans are 
designed to reflect this.

Operational improvements
The second part of our plan tackles the need to be a low cost 
producer if we are to compete effectively and deliver profitability 
for 	 shar eholders. 	 Our 	 infrastructur e 	 has 	 expanded 	 faster 	 than 	 our	
rate of business growth. Without jeopardising our capabilities 
or potential for future growth, we must now prune out non-
value-adding overheads and reduce our cost structure to a more 
proportionate size. To this end, we have embarked on a strategic 
cost management programme comprising a number of elements.
We will continue to transfer more of our production offshore  
to low cost areas. In pursuit of this strategic aim, the restructuring  
in Germany and the UK, which we started in 2009, was completed 
in 	 2010, 	 delivering 	 cost 	 savings 	 in 	 the 	 year 	 of 	 appr oximately	 
£ 9 . 5 	 m i l l i o n . 	 W e 	 e x p e c t 	 t o 	 s e e 	 f u r t h e r 	 o n g o i n g 	 s a v i n g s .	
We can make further progress in this direction and are targeting to 
achieve an increase in our workforce located in low cost countries. 
There will be costs in 2011 to achieve this with the full benefits 
flowing in 2012. Typically the payback period for offshoring is on 
average around one year. 
W e 	 w i l l 	 e x a m i n e 	 o p t i o n s 	 t o 	 r a t i o n a l i s e 	 o u r 	 s p a c e 	 r e q u i r e m e n t s 	 i n 	 t h e	
UK and we will reorganise the way we run our business to achieve 
both synergies and economies of scale. 
We are reducing our senior manager numbers by bringing  
together senior management teams, eliminating duplication and 
reducing the number of central function heads. This should lead  
to additional savings. 
At the same time we want to develop a performance culture with 
a focus on economic returns. To do this we are creating greater 
responsibility and accountability for performance throughout the 
company. This will be supported by the introduction of a revised 
incentive plan for management based on value creation. 
A more focused supplier management programme will contribute 
to improved competitiveness of cost inputs. This programme seeks 
annual savings of about £3 million to £5 million from 2012.
Revenue growth
The third part of our plan addresses our ability to generate  
revenue growth.
Current market trends are providing an environment offering 
the potential for us to grow. Chief amongst these are increasing 
demand for global sourcing; for value-added services and an 
innovative approach to methodologies and new processes; and 
for the increasing use of technology, especially cloud technology 
(see page 14). Companies are looking to outsourcing as a means 
of managing risk, reducing costs and complying with increasingly 
rigorous regulatory demands. For outsourcers, industry-specific 
e x p e r t i s e 	 a n d 	 c a p a b i l i t i e s 	 a n d 	 t e c h n o l o g y 	 a r e 	 p r o v i n g 	 t o 	 b e	
competitive differentiators.
To achieve profitable revenue growth, we have refocused our market 
strategy. Whilst establishing new Enterprise Partnerships offers the 
opportunity to gain step changes in levels of revenue generation,  
it is just one way to achieve growth. In recent years our new revenue 
has come primarily from straightforward outsourcing contracts, 
business support services and product sales. We will continue 
to pursue this approach and will also actively pursue partnering 
opportunities with other service providers.
Expanding 	 our 	 business 	 with 	 existing 	 customers, 	 either 	 with 	 additional	
s e r v i c e s 	 o r 	 b y 	 e x t e n d i n g 	 i n t o 	 o t h e r 	 g e o g r a p h i e s , 	 i s 	 a 	 s t r o n g 	 g r o w t h	
strategy. So we will continue to focus on our top 50 customers. There 
is 	 also 	 good 	 scope 	 to 	 expand 	 r elatively 	 small 	 existing 	 contracts 	 with	
the very large companies in our top 300 customer list. 
As part of our introduction of a greater focus on economic returns, 
we plan to improve the effectiveness of our sales force through 
greater accountability and closer links to targets. 
Cash flow and funding structure
The fourth part of our plan is to improve our cash flow and to 
ensure our funding arrangements are both adequate and efficient. 
We have now placed a keen focus on cash flow in all our businesses 
and need to improve conversion of operating profit into operating 
cash 	 flow . 	 Capital 	 expenditur e 	 will 	 now 	 have 	 clear 	 limitations 	 and 	
we are seeking improvements in our working capital management.
We have started to discuss ways of reconfiguring our funding 
arrangements. In particular we are looking at cash in the Enterprise 
Partnerships and the financial structure of Cambridge to see how 
we 	 can 	 intr oduce 	 mor e 	 flexibility 	 to 	 the 	 finances 	 of 	 these 	 businesses. 	
Such 	 flexibility 	 in 	 our 	 inter nal 	 funding 	 flows 	 will 	 facilitate 	 both 	 our 	
immediate restructuring plans and our future growth. 
Our current structure does not fully utilise the debt capacity of  
the 	 Gr oup 	 and, 	 even 	 at 	 the 	 lower 	 levels 	 of 	 pr ofitability 	 expected 	 for 	
2011, the Group EBITDA should comfortably support debt service  
at a higher level. 
Our bank facility is scheduled for renewal in October 2012. We are 
initiating renewal negotiations early to ensure we have the funding 
in place to support our plans and to provide comfort to shareholders. 
This process should be complete by the time of our half-year results.
Outlook
There is no doubt that 2011 is going to be a challenging year. An 
action plan to capture the good parts of our business and to address 
the poorly performing areas is underway. 
We believe our base revenue is secure. Our basic business is sound 
and 	 we 	 have 	 a 	 str ong 	 customer 	 base. 	 Our 	 experience 	 and 	 expertise,	
technology and global presence position us well to take advantage 
of the market trend towards greater outsourcing.
It will be a year of transition as we address and resolve some clearly 
defined problems. Based on the outcome of a detailed evaluation, 
we have a four-part plan to generate profitable revenue growth, 
to embed a focus on value creation, reduce cost and potentially 
reshape our business. Implementation of the plan has begun and

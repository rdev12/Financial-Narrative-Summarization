Chairman’s
Review
Abcam has recently celebrated its tenth 
anniversary and I am delighted to report on 
another outstanding year as the Group 
continues to go from strength to strength. 
Demand for research antibodies 
has never been higher, nor has 
our reputation. Our highly 
developed e-commerce 
platform, offering targeted 
information and easy access  
to products, has become the 
destination of choice for 
increasing numbers of 
researchers across the world. 
Our intention is to consistently 
deliver robust growth whilst at 
the same time investing in the 
future of the business, thus 
ensuring that we have a solid 
and sustainable foundation for 
long-term development. This 
has been achieved this year 
and the business is well set for 
continued success.
We have achieved strong 
growth in all the regions in 
which we operate: sales in the 
year increased by 49.7% to 
£36.7m (49. % on a constant 
currency basis), whilst gross 
margins increased from 59. % 
to 60.8%. This outstanding 
performance is a testimony  
to the quality of the products 
and support we offer, the 
scalability of our operation and 
Abcam’s growing reputation as 
a quality supplier to the world 
scientific community. 
A key driver of our success is 
our wealth of product data. This 
set of data is a tremendous 
asset and includes technical 
information, application specific 
information, user-generated 
reviews and how our products 
have been used in published 
experiments. Using this 
relevant, easily accessible 
information, research scientists 
can identify and purchase the 
products best suited for their 
requirements. During the year, 
our catalogue increased by 
more than  0,000 products, 
from 33,900 at the end of the 
last financial year to over 
44,000 at the end of June 2008. 
Sales of individual products 
tend to increase the longer they 
are listed and as more data is 
gathered. New products 
contributed £3.2m to sales in 
the year and we expect sales 
from these new launches to 
increase in future years. 
Our investments in the year 
included the continued 
development of the high-
throughput production (HTP) 
facility. The HTP facility has 
taken on the production of new 
and existing polyclonal 
antibodies and been very 
successful in adding 
characterisation data, which is 
an important driver of growth, 
to our existing catalogue. A 
priority for this year has been 
increasing production 
efficiencies and managing 
costs. We have also continued 
development work on our 
automated monoclonal 
development programme. The 
initial level of sales of the 
monoclonal antibodies added 
to the catalogue during the year 
has been well ahead of

expectations and we will 
continue to prudently manage 
monoclonal production levels in 
line with the development of our 
production process. 
Our offices in the USA and 
Japan have both grown 
significantly in the year and our 
commitment to optimising the 
user experience has driven 
further investment in our 
website infrastructure, and the 
establishment of a dedicated  
e-commerce team. We are also 
continuing to build our 
distributor network in order to 
improve our geographic reach 
in parts of the world where an 
e-commerce model has yet to 
be fully embraced. 
We have continued to attract 
staff of the highest calibre to 
ensure that our growth is 
targeted and well managed. A 
high proportion of our staff have 
PhDs and we aim to blend a 
depth of technical knowledge 
with strong commercial 
acumen. In November 2007 we 
appointed Jeff Iliffe as Chief 
Financial Officer and, with the 
extremely valuable 
contributions from the non-
executive directors, we have a 
strong and effective Board.
Our aim is to continue 
delivering value to both our 
customers and our 
shareholders and I would like to 
thank them for their continued 
support. I would also like to 
extend thanks to our growing 
number of suppliers and finally 
to our dedicated and talented 
staff, who make these 
achievements possible. 
Dividends
The Board’s policy is to 
distribute 33% of profit after tax 
as dividends. This was 
increased from 25% last year, in 
line with the strong cashflow 
and growing success of the 
Group. An interim dividend of 
 .04p per share was paid in 
April 2008 and the Directors 
are therefore recommending a 
final dividend of 4.56p per 
share, making a total for the 
year of 5.60p. Subject to 
shareholder approval at the 
Annual General Meeting in 
November, this dividend will be 
paid on 28 November 2008 to 
shareholders on the register on 
7 November 2008.
Outlook
Our track record demonstrates 
the strength of the combination 
of our highly developed  
e-commerce platform, wealth  
of product data, extensive 
range of antibodies and high-
calibre staff. We have built an 
attractive position in an exciting 
market and the Board looks to 
the future with confidence.

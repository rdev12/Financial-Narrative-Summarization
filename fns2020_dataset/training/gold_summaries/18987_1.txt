 ceo’s review
Looking ahead, we remain confident  
in the outlook for the Group, reflected  
in our commitment to maintain our 
progressive dividend policy. 
Overview
Following my appointment as Chief 
Executive Officer on 1 July 2015, I am 
delighted to present the full year results, 
after another good 12-month period for 
the business. It has been a busy year 
with a number of achievements  
to report.
The Company continues to provide 
a wide range of telecommunications 
services to consumers, businesses and 
the public sector on the Isle of Man, and 
we pride ourselves on our excellent 
customer service. Our core domestic 
business performed well during the 
year, with growth in fixed, broadband 
and data services, and mobile revenues. 
Following the launch of our 4G mobile 
network in 2014 we have seen an 
increase in the number of customers 
returning to Manx Telecom, high customer 
satisfaction levels and a resultant increase 
in mobile revenue for the year.

The Data Centre business has seen 
strong revenue growth during the period. 
This reflects a higher than usual level of 
equipment sales, as customers moved 
into the first phase of the Greenhill Data 
Centre (‘GDC 1’). We completed the second 
phase of our Greenhill Data Centre (‘GDC 
2’) and welcomed our anchor tenant into 
the facility in the fourth quarter. Both GDC 
1 and GDC 2 are now over 50% occupied 
and we continue to focus on attracting 
further co-location and managed service 
business into the portfolio.
The Global Solutions business has seen 
good growth in its core products, M2M, 
Strongest Signal Mobile (branded 
Chameleon) and the international 
traveller market, which helped to partially 
offset the expected decline in our SMS 
termination business.
The renewal of our long-term contract 
with the Isle of Man Government for 
mobile, local area network, wide area 
network, fixed line, internet and network 
services and securing them as an anchor 
tenant for phase 2 of our Greenhill Data 
Centre development are testament to the 
hard work of our teams on the ground 
and strong business partnerships on the 
Isle of Man.
The Isle of Man economy continues to 
perform well, with unemployment at 1.9%, 
31 years of unbroken GDP growth and 
economic growth forecast to continue. 
We look to support the Isle of Man 
Government in attracting business to 
the Island, and our telecommunications 
infrastructure and the services we 
provide form an important part of 
the Island’s continued success.
The Company was also pleased to have 
renegotiated its £80m credit facility on 
improved terms and extended the term 
to June 2020.
Results overview
The Company’s performance for the 
period was in line with the Board’s 
expectations. Revenue grew by 0.4%  
to £79.6m, driven by increases in fixed, 
broadband and data, mobile and data 
centre services, partially offset by a 
decline in Global Solutions revenues.
Underlying EBITDA was 2.0% higher 
than last year at £27.7m and the margin 
was maintained at 34.7% (2014: 34.2%). 
A reduction in the lower margin, 
wholesale SMS and voice elements 
of the Global Solutions business 
was partly offset by a high level of 
equipment sales and increases in the 
broadband and mobile business.
Cash generation has remained strong 
with cash generated from operations of 
£25.4m (2014: £27.0m), equating to cash 
conversion of 92% of EBITDA. 
Underlying profit after tax increased by 
27.9% to £16.6m (2014: £12.9m) primarily 
due to the increased EBITDA, lower 
interest costs (£1.3m reduction), lower 
depreciation (£0.4m reduction) and 
a positive movement in the fair value 
of interest rate swaps (£1.6m positive 
variance to prior year). This resulted in 
a 19.4% increase in underlying diluted 
earnings per share to 14.53p (2014: 12.17p).
We continue to invest in capital projects 
on the Isle of Man and have spent £8.0m 
(2014: £12.6m) in the year. This includes the 
development of the second phase of the 
GDC and the upgrade of our CRM billing 
and charging platform, which will 
enhance our consumer offering on the 
Isle of Man from 2016.

annual report and accounts 2015 Fixed, broadband and data services
Fixed, broadband and data services 
provide fixed line voice, broadband and 
connectivity services for customers, 
connecting approximately 37,000 homes 
and 4,000 businesses on the Isle of 
Man. Fixed, broadband and data is our 
largest business, representing 40% of 
all Company revenues. In 2015 revenue 
increased by 2.2% to £32m (2014: £31.3m).
On 1 September 2015 we opened up our 
fixed network, providing a wholesale 
fixed line product to our competitors.  
As part of this process, we rebalanced 
our tariffs, with fixed line tariffs increasing 
and VDSL broadband tariffs reducing. 
This has brought a competitive fixed line 
product to the market and a further 
incentive for customers to move to our 
higher speed broadband products. 
Fixed line revenues remained flat in the 
year, as the decline in fixed line usage 
was offset by line rental increases.
We continue to roll-out high speed VDSL 
broadband services (up to 40Mbps 
download) across the Island and now 
reach 91% of households, and is now  
at 29% penetration. Earlier this year we 
launched VDSL plus superfast broadband 
– Ultima Plus – which delivers download 
speeds of up to 80Mbps and upload 
speeds of 10Mbps. The sale of Ultima and 
Ultima Plus has helped broadband 
revenues to increase by 4.3% to £8.7m.
Mobile
Mobile had a strong year, with revenue 
up 9.3% to £20.1m (2014: £18.4m), driven 
primarily by increased inbound roaming 
revenue and increased post-paid  
contract revenue.
Our 4G network, which provides 99% 
population coverage at speeds of up to  
ten times faster than 3G services, is now 
available to contract and pay as you go 
customers who have a 4G-compatible 
handset. Launched in 2014, it continues  
to achieve high levels of customer 
satisfaction with adoption rates growing 
steadily across both the pay as you go 
and contract bases.
By the end of 2015, we had approximately 
34.5k pre-paid customers (2014: 35.1k) and 
30.1k post-paid customers (2014: 28.9k). 
The introduction of 4G and general 
up-selling of data packages has 
contributed to a 2.0% increase in post-
paid Average Revenue Per User (‘ARPU’) 
and 4.3% increase in pre-paid ARPU over 
the past 12 months.
Data centre
The data centre business offers co-
location, managed hosting, cloud  
and disaster recovery services to an 
international and local corporate client 
base. These services are supplied by 
three data centres at Douglas North, 
Douglas Central and Greenhill Data 
Centre. The data centres at GDC and 
Douglas North are Tier 3 designed data 
centres (according to Telecommunications 
Industry Association standards). This 
provides high standards of data security, 
resilience, and expandable hosting 
capacity, including business continuity 
and distributed denial of service 
protection (‘DDoS’).
During 2015 we completed the 
development of the second phase of our 
Greenhill Data Centre and welcomed 
an anchor tenant into the facility during 
the fourth quarter. Both GDC 1 and GDC 
2 are now over 50% occupied. Data 
centre revenues increased by 20.3% 
in the period, to £8.0m (2014: £6.6m), 
however this was driven by lower 
margin equipment sales as a result 
of new customers entering GDC 1.
We have seen a trend towards co-
location data centre business and our 
focus is to secure more managed service 
business to better utilise our investment.

Global solutions
The Global Solutions business generates 
revenue from services which run 
on our domestic mobile technology 
platform and utilise our international 
roaming agreements. This enables 
us to offer a variety of products to 
UK and international partners who 
use our Global Solutions sim cards. 
There are four key revenue areas: 
wholesale SMS and voice, international 
traveller market, M2M and strongest 
signal mobile (branded Chameleon).
As expected, revenues declined in the 
period, with turnover down 15.3% during 
the year to £14.1m, (2014: £16.7m) driven by 
the decline in SMS termination revenue.  
A number of initiatives including 
additional resource, helped to increase 
revenues in the second half of the year 
and generate momentum into 2016. The 
higher margin core revenue from M2M 
and Chameleon, increased by 20% during 
the year, helping to offset some of the 
decline from reducing termination 
revenues and supporting the positive 
long-term outlook for Global Solutions.
Other revenues
Other revenues include the advertising 
revenue from our telephone directory, 
hardware equipment sales, 
interconnection fees and managed 
services.
Other revenue declined by 13.4% during 
the year to £5.4m (2014: £6.3m). This was 
primarily due to lower hardware 
equipment sales and the expected 
decline in directory advertising revenues, 
which accounted for 10% of the revenue 
decline in the period.
Gary Lamb
Chief Executive Officer
We continue to generate strong cash 
flow, which enables us to create value 
for shareholders, while continuing to 
invest in our infrastructure projects at 
an average of £10m per year over the 
last three years.

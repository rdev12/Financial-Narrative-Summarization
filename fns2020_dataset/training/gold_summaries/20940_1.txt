Introduction
I am pleased to report that the Group has had a satisfactory 
year in a challenging market. The profit before tax result of 
£1.5 million should be read within the context of a first-half 
loss before tax of £0.3 million. 
Financial Review
Revenue in the year ended 31 October 2009 was up by 15% to 
£13.1 million (2008: £11.4 million). Underlying profit before 
tax increased by 5% to £2.2 million (2008: £2.1 million). 
Profit before tax, which is stated after charging share-based 
payments, is up 7% to £1.5 million (2008: £1.4 million). Cash 
generation was again strong with balances at the year end of 
£10.5 million (2008: £9.5 million) which represented some 
370% of our regulatory capital requirement.
Underlying basic earnings per share (before charging share-
based payments) increased by 31% to 8.0p (2008: 6.1p) with 
underlying diluted earnings per share increasing by 36% to 
7.5p (2008: 5.5p). Basic earnings per share increased by 65% 
to 5.1p (2008: 3.1p).
Equities Division
Our Equities Division revenue increased by 31% to £8.5 
million (2008: £6.5 million) against an increase in the FTSE All 
Share index of 18% over the same period. Since the year end, 
commission income levels have been satisfactory.
Corporate Finance
During the year we completed sixteen corporate finance 
transactions (2008: twelve) including nine M&A, six secondary 
fundraisings and one IPO. 
Outlook
The current year has started satisfactorily and Arden has to 
date raised some £111 million for corporate clients. We have 
relocated our main office to 125 Old Broad Street which 
provides the space and infrastructure for future growth.
Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our staff 
for their commitment through challenging conditions.

The past financial year has seen 
focus on the following areas:
The core consumer product 
ONSPEED, improving the cost 
of acquisition and focusing on 
customer retention, mitigating a 
reduction in sales as a result of the 
increasing use of Broadband;
ONSPEED Mobile which 
provides a fast, full Internet expe-
rience on a mobile phone, was 
launched last March 2006 and 
the business continues to focus 
on sales both to consumers and 
also to operators; 
The development of the innova-
tive file sharing service OnShare, 
and its underlying technology. 
Beta testing of OnShare was 
concluded in February 2007 and 
is demonstrating encouraging 
signs of success;
Laying the groundwork for the 
release of new products; and
Towards the end of the year, 
the commencement of a cost-
cutting exercise.

The Group’s results for the 12 months 
ending 28 February 2007 show a 
loss before tax of £1.1 million on 
turnover of £2.6 million, compared 
to a restated profit in 2006 of £0.4 
million on turnover of £5.0 million.
Turnover from ONSPEED re-
presents 88% of total turnover 
for the year. The fall in ONSPEED 
turnover from £4.4 million for 2006 
to £2.4 million in 2007 was princi-
pally as a result of the growth of 
competitive, fast Broadband in the 
UK, Europe and the US. 
Net2Roam contributed £0.1 million 
to turnover (2006: £0.4 million) 
and ONSPEED Mobile which was 
launched in 2006 added £0.1 million 
to turnover. 
The loss in the year adjusted for all  
non-cash items was £0.6 million. 
Together with the investment 
in OnShare of £1.3 million, 
this has resulted in a net cash 
outflow of £1.9 million, leaving 
cash resources of £2.2 million at  
28 February 2007.
A cost saving plan was implemented 
in January 2007 and we are already 
seeing the benefits in the current 
financial year.

333,172 shares were issued in the 
year on the exercise of share options 
by three option holders.
A further 3,942,134 shares were 
issued to the minority shareholders 
of Onshare Limited to acquire the 
49% minority interest in the business, 
ensuring that the benefits of the future 
success of this service will flow 100% 
to Z GROUP shareholders.
rE viEw Of Op Era TiONS
The primary aims in the past year were 
to maintain good customer retention 
in ONSPEED, while gaining market 
traction for two new products, 
ONSPEED Mobile and OnShare. 
ONSpEEd
In spite of the predicted decline in 
Dial-up Internet access, ONSPEED 
has performed well throughout the 
year in retaining its direct customer 
base whilst gaining additional rest of 
the world revenue through partner-
ships in new territories. Online sales 
continue to account for the majority 
of sales both in the UK and abroad. 
ONSPEED has been a mainstay since the business was 
founded and has provided a valuable Internet service 
for those consumers who have not converted to Internet 
Broadband usage.
“safe”
“(OnShare is) a safe and convenient  
way of sharing files among friends”
Web User
Z GROUP plc ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 We recognise the need for  
local support within international 
markets and have established  
relationships with key local 
partners, which we have found to 
be highly beneficial in supporting 
sales growth. Following the 
success of ONSPEED sales via 
the web and the release of the 
retail version in Europe, we have 
signed a number of additional 
distribution deals for ONSPEED 
in Poland and Russia. In Russia, 
we deployed a retail promotion 
in March 2006 through monthly 
scratch cards, thereby addressing 
low credit card penetration  
and successfully attracting  
direct consumer revenue. In August 
2006, we closed an agreement with 
Voxnet, one of Poland’s leading 
ISPs, to promote ONSPEED and 
ONSPEED Mobile. 
The Group’s retail presence in 
Europe and the US has also been 
strengthened. In April 2006, the 
Group signed a retail agreement 
with Avanquest, a leading global 
publisher of best-selling personal 
and professional software 
marketed in over 100 countries, 
for France and Spain gaining a 
retail presence in key multiples 
including FNAC, Boulanger and 
through select online portals 
such as Bluesquad and Blitzbox. 
In February 2007, we appointed 
Navarre (NASDAQ: NAVR), a 
leading distributor of home enter-
tainment PC software in the US. 
In June 2006, we announced an 
extension to the agreement with 
BT to distribute ONSPEED to BT’s 
512kb Broadband base, giving 
these customers up to 5 times 
faster connectivity with ONSPEED 
Version 5. The Group continues to 
use these high profile relationships 
to further improve its awareness 
and credibility to a wider interna-
tional audience. 
Marketing spend on ONSPEED 
represented 29% of total Group 
indirect costs, representing a 
continuation of the historically 
efficient use of marketing. With 
targeted media buying and 
innovative in-house analysis, cost 
per sale equated to an efficient 
£6.76 compared to £8.04 in 2006. 
To further increase ARPU across 
the ONSPEED base, we launched 
an ONSPEED toolbar in February 
2007, providing more value to the 
ONSPEED product as well as a 
search box powered by YAHOO! to 
capitalise on search revenue from 
the ONSPEED base. The benefit 
of this added capability will be 
reflected in next year’s results. 
ONSPEED Mobile
The ONSPEED Mobile product 
became commercially available  
in March 2006 via Internet 
subscription and through existing 
UK distribution channels, including 
Amazon, PC World, Play and 
Staples. ONSPEED Mobile has 
received wide acclaim in the trade 
press, many of whom believe that 
demand will be triggered by the 
current expense of accessing the 
Internet via mobile devices – the 
same driver behind the original  
success of ONSPEED.

Fifteen publications have 
presented upbeat reviews, 
some granting 5 star awards, 
notably Computer Active, Stuff 
and WebUser. Although direct 
consumer sales have been slow 
to materialise, the Directors 
believe in the size and strength 
of the mobile Internet market 
and feel ONSPEED Mobile is 
well-positioned to benefit from 
longer term consumer take-up. In 
addition, deeper market penetra-
tion will take place via partnership 
with mobile network operators 
as demonstrated by a diverse 
pipeline of potential partners and 
jurisdictions.
OnShare
The Group has continued to 
invest significantly in OnShare, 
the proprietary file sharing 
software. The development of 
OnShare over the last 12 months 
has seen a series of continuous 
improvements to the design 
and functionality of the OnShare 
product, with focus on building 
stability and ease of use. In 
addition, significant R&D has been 
invested in OnShare’s underlying 
protocol, “ActiveStream”. This 
proprietary IP will be re-used and 
is set to become the basis for 
future consumer and corporate 
product development. 
OnShare was launched to a test 
group of users in March 2006, with 
subsequent upgrades through the 
year. This test identified a number 
of required improvements prior 
to launch and in February 2007 
a soft launch was implemented 
providing users with free access 
to the product which included a 
mechanism to encourage viral 
marketing. The growth in users 
has exceeded budget and based 
on this trend, we plan to commer-
cialise the product with marketing 
support around the middle of 
the current financial year. Share-
holders will be informed at the 
commencement of this initiative 
and will be regularly updated as  
to progress.
Net2Roam
Net2Roam continues to provide 
a consistent revenue stream, 
with very little requirement for 
additional resources or marketing 
budget. Relaunched in February 
2007 using iPass (NASDAQ: IPAS) 
infrastructure, Net2Roam added 
76,000 Wi-Fi hotspots in 68 
countries to its offering.

A cost saving plan was imple-
mented starting in January 2007, 
based on a staff redundancy 
programme, continuing focus 
on efficient marketing spend, 
streamlining server use across 
our portfolio of products and 
negotiating better terms with  
our suppliers. 
As a result of these costs  
savings, our unaudited manage-
ment accounts for the first two 
months of the current financial  
year show a 30% reduction in 
administrative costs year-on-year. 
In addition, consolidated sales 
for quarter one of the current year 
are ahead of budget.
OUTLOOk
The extended test launch of 
OnShare, although putting us 
behind our original plan at the 
time of admission to AIM, has 
resulted in a stronger offering to 
consumers. OnShare offers several 
unique features to consumers and 
to SMEs which the Group intends 
to take full advantage of in the

the R&D invested in OnShare’s 
underlying proprietary protocol, 
“ActiveStream” is well-placed 
to be used in other products 
developed by the Group to drive 
future revenue streams. 
Mobile Internet usage is the 
key driver to ONSPEED Mobile, 
our other recent product, which 
uses proprietary compression 
technology to enable more 
efficient access to the Internet,  
and we are confident of the 
conclusion of operator agreements 
and healthy consumer demand in  
the coming year.
The Group has continued to 
identify commercial opportuni-
ties for new technologies and 
to develop products that satisfy 
consumer needs. We have a 
confirmed launch plan for two new 
and exciting software products 
that adhere to our high margin, 
pre-paid criteria.
The sentiment within the Group is 
one of excitement for the current 
financial year, with a focus on 
maintaining our core businesses, 
exploiting the Group’s IP and 
developing a new pipeline of 
products with a more efficient 
cost-base.

Shaft Sinkers Holdings Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013
CEO’s Review
Following a review of the Group’s 
activities last year, we took a 
number of steps to restructure 
the business in the first half of 
2013, cutting costs and reducing 
operating overheads by 17% and 
ensuring the optimal mix of skills 
across our business. 
Gross margins improved to 13% in 
the year as a result of changes to 
the way in which certain 
engineering costs were allocated 
within our South African business. 
Although the margin 
improvement was offset by a rise 
in operating expenses the 
reallocation process has enabled 
us to identify a number of 
opportunities to reduce costs 
which we will pursue in 2014. 
However, the challenging 
conditions in the mining sector 
continued to affect our financial 
performance. Revenues declined 
by 21% in 2013 with gross profits 
for the year falling by 
approximately 11.5% as a result of 
reduced work load in South Africa 
as well as the deterioration in the 
value of the Rand against Sterling, 
which impacted profits by 
GBP0.2 million. The GBP3.9 
million of legal costs associated 
with the EuroChem arbitration 
processes were well above 
expectations and therefore also a 
significant drag on profitability. 
Operational performance across 
our projects during 2013 was 
mixed. Whilst our work on the 
Kibali project for Randgold 
Resources and our projects for 
Lonmin proceeded well during 
2013 we experienced operational 
problems at Impala, Leuwkop, 
Styldrift and Hindustan Zinc. 
 
Despite a difficult environment, 
the Group won in excess of 
GBP47 million of repeat business 
from existing clients such as 
Lonmin, Afplats and Impala and 
was selected as preferred bidder 
to sink a shaft for Kazchrome 
during 2013. This is testament to 
the continued hard work of our 
teams and the attractiveness of 
our proposition. However, Shaft 
Sinkers was not awarded any 
major new contracts during the 
year, significantly hampering our 
planned profitability.
We remain in discussions with 
Kazchrome having been 
appointed as the preferred bidder 
for the Kazchrome Donskoy Gok 
project in August 2013 and we will 
provide further updates in due 
course. We also expect to be 
awarded extensions of work on 
existing projects in 2014, such as 
Lonmin K3 and Leeuwkop. 
The Group continues to tender for 
a number of significant contracts 
around the world however we 
cannot at this stage predict the 
timing or outcome of these 
processes. 
Cash flow is anticipated to be 
tight until the latter half of the 
year and liquidity issues in South 
Africa have been exacerbated by 
the lack of revenues from the 
strike-affected projects as well as 
poor operational performance. 
We continue to review a range of

options to address this issue and 
will provide further information as 
necessary. 
Strategy
As expected, the current situation 
in the global mining sector 
continues to validate our strategy 
to diversify into different 
commodities, geographies and 
sectors. Revenues from our 
international business rose 
strongly in the year to GBP42.1 
million from GBP16.0 million in the 
prior year and offset some of the 
decline in revenues from South 
Africa. Revenues from our 
International business now 
represent almost 28% of total 
revenues, up from approximately 
8% in 2012 and 19% in 2011. We 
expect this trend to continue over 
the medium term as we secure 
more international business 
through new partnerships. 
During 2013 we also made 
progress in a number of key areas 
with regards to increasing 
diversification through the 
conclusion of collaboration 
agreements with China Nonferrous 
Metal Industry’s Foreign 
Engineering and Construction Co., 
Ltd. (‘NFC’), one of the largest 
Chinese Engineering, Procurement 
and Construction Management 
(‘EPCM’) companies and India’s 
Tata Projects Limited, the EPCM 
subsidiary of TATA Group. These 
two agreements, whilst in the early 
stage, have the potential to deliver 
significant long-term benefit by 
providing improved access to the 
growing markets of India and 
China. Another initiative in its early 
stages is the collaboration 
between the Group and Laing 
O’Rourke, a large UK based 
construction group. We have 
jointly submitted a proposal to 
Sirius Minerals to perform some 
early design work.
As our business internationalises 
we face a different set of risks to 
those which affect our core South 
African operations. The ability to 
operate successfully within 
different legal, regulatory and 
cultural norms is every bit as 
complex as the difficult geological 
or operational challenges we face. 
We are therefore focusing on 
improving our project 
management skills to deal with 
these challenges and to learn from 
operations where we are working 
successfully, such as Kibali 
Goldmines in the DRC.
We also continue to focus on 
changing the nature of our 
contractual arrangements with 
clients. Historically our work has 
been carried out on rates-based 
contracts which expose the Group 
to significant risk in the event of 
unforeseen circumstances relating 
to geological or mine plan 
adjustments which slow the rate of 
progress achieved by Shaft 
Sinkers. When negotiating new 
contracts for existing clients we 
were successful in moving the 
contract type to one which more 
equitably shares the risks in a 
number of instances, notably with 
Lonmin at Karee 3 and Impala 16 
which have changed to an agreed 
target cost basis.
Operations – International
Work at the Kibali Goldmines 
project in the Democratic Republic 
of Congo proceeded well, with a 
number of major operational 
milestones achieved during 2013, 
notably the start of the main 
sinking phase in November. The 
project has performed in line with 
budget and the shaft has recently 
reached a depth of 483m ahead of 
schedule with sinking proceeding 
at a rate of at least 3 metres a day 
for more than 30 continuous days. 
Achieving this high level of 
operational performance in what 
many consider to be a complex 
and difficult operating 
environment, is a significant 
achievement. 
The project for Hindustan Zinc 
Limited (‘HZL ’) at the Rampura 
Agucha mine progressed more 
slowly than expected because of 
problems with a civil engineering 
subcontractor during the first half 
of the year. Having dismissed the 
subcontractor and taken over its 
responsibilities ourselves the 
project operated in line with 
expected rates. However sinking 
progress in the later part of 2013 
was poor and resulted in higher 
than expected costs and lower 
revenues. As the HZL project is 
being conducted on a rates type 
contract, our revenue is linked to 
the number of metres sunk and 
the slow performance meant that 
we failed to meet expected sinking 
rates and thus our revenue was 
lower than expected whilst our 
costs remained relatively fixed.  STRATEGIC REPORT

CEO’s Review continued
The HZL team has since worked 
hard at mitigating the issues 
affecting performance and we are 
currently experiencing a much 
improved performance level.
Operations – South Africa
The Group’s South African 
operations were significantly 
impacted by the difficult operating 
environment in 2013. Contracts 
were cancelled during the year in 
response to declining commodity 
prices and rising operating costs in 
the country. 
Despite this difficult operating 
environment we were awarded a 
number of contract extensions for 
South African clients, with Afplats, 
Lonmin and Impala agreeing to an 
additional GBP47.6 million worth of 
work for the Group. This is 
testament to the vital nature of our 
work for these clients and the 
strong relationships we have built 
with their management teams 
despite the challenging 
environment. 
 
We successfully reduced the level 
of outstanding variation orders 
during the first half of the year, 
however, they began to build again 
during the second half of 2013. 
However, we were successful in 
collecting many of the outstanding 
variation orders in the last quarter 
of 2013 and were therefore able to 
reduce the Group’s debtors’ book 
outstanding, resulting in a small 
improvement in cash before the 
repayment of debt.
As a result of the removal of one 
layer of operational management 
and a range of other cost cutting 
initiatives such as consolidating 
roles, eliminating unrecoverable 
costs and reducing overtime we 
were able to significantly reduce 
operational overheads. Total 
headcount in South Africa has 
now declined from approximately 
7,200 to 3,923 at the end of 2013. 
The Group will continue to 
examine its overhead structures 
and look for opportunities to 
reduce costs in this very sensitive 
period for the mining industry.
 
However, these improvements 
were offset by significant 
operational underperformance at 
a number of operations, with 
performance at the Impala 17 and 
Styldrift projects being particularly 
disappointing. 
Styldrift experienced poor 
operational performance over the 
last two months of the 
measurement period stemming 
from some poor planning. 
Our Impala 17 project was severely 
impacted by safety stoppages as 
a result of Section 54 notices 
during 2013 and a generally poor 
safety record in the year. Under 
Section 54 of the Mine Health and 
Safety Act of South Africa, the 
mine safety inspectorate can close 
all or part of a mine in the event 
that it believes any conditions or 
particular events could impact the 
health and safety of anybody 
working in the mine (see the 
Corporate Responsibility section 
on page 38 for more details). 
Management has taken various 
steps to improve the situation 
including engaging a third party 
health and safety expert firm to 
perform an independent 
assessment of site safety systems. 
The assessment rated the project’s 
safety systems very highly, 
although it found that in a number 
of cases issues which had been 
identified were not dealt with 
effectively. A number of 
recommendations have since been 
adopted in order to improve the 
clarity of the safety reporting and 
ensure issues are fully resolved. 
As a result of the operational 
difficulties at Impala 17 Shaft 
Sinkers lost GBP0.6 million on the 
project in 2013 and has lost a 
further GBP0.9 million since the 
financial year end to March 2014. 
In April 2014, after the year end, 
we reached agreement with 
Impala over a revision to the terms 
of the contract for Impala 17 under 
which Shaft Sinkers will be 
compensated for labour and 
materials based on an agreed rate 
and will have the opportunity to 
be paid an additional bonus 
element based on achieving 
certain performance criteria.
The revised terms, which became 
effective from 15 April 2014, are 
expected to improve the financial 
performance of this contract. The 
new contract runs until to 15 
September 2014, after which date 
it will terminate if not renewed. 
Impala is retendering the contract 
and Shaft Sinkers is participating 
in the retender process. 13

South African Labour situation
After the end of the year, the 
Association of Mineworkers and 
Construction Union (‘AMCU’) 
initiated a protected strike 
affecting South Africa’s major 
platinum producers which had 
suspended operations at Impala 16 
and Lonmin. The current situation 
between the AMCU and the mining 
companies appears deadlocked 
with little signs of movement by 
either side. As a result, there is 
currently little clarity on when and 
how the strike will conclude.
Our employees are not on strike, 
however they have been 
prevented from working at 
affected sites. Shaft Sinkers has 
contractual provisions in place 
which are designed to ensure that 
we will recover certain costs in the 
event that our clients’ operations 
are impacted by strike action not 
related to us. However, even with 
these contractual provisions, the 
Group’s profitability will be 
impacted. 
METS
Our Mining Engineering and 
Technical Services (‘METS’) 
division continues to find new 
opportunities for design and EPCM 
contracts. In 2013 METS managed 
the highly complex project to 
design, engineer, coordinate and 
supervise manufacture of the head 
gears for the HZL project. 
This required the sourcing of more 
than 2,000 tonnes of a certain 
specification of steel across China, 
India and South Africa. We 
successfully met the aggressive 
timetables set and gained 
additional invaluable experience in 
international project management 
which will be of significant long-
term benefit to the Group. 
Furthermore, in 2013 our METS 
division designed a new and 
progressive main sinking 
methodology in collaboration with 
our Indian and Russian offices. The 
new method promises a safer and 
more cost effective sinking 
operation especially for shallower 
ventilation type shafts. The Group 
will be implementing this new 
sinking methodology at HZL. 
Health, Safety and Environment
There were a number of 
significant positive achievements 
during the year with regards to 
health and safety. Notably, we 
achieved zero fatalities for the 
year and the Group has yet again 
recorded 2 million fatality free 
shifts across its operations. 
However, due to a number of 
incidents the Group’s Lost Time 
Injury Frequency Rate rose to 
4.75 from 4.08 in 2012, compared 
to our target of 3.5. As previously 
disclosed, a new safety and 
behaviour campaign has been 
introduced across the Group with 
the aim of creating greater 
awareness of safety standards 
and procedures. We have 
reintroduced a behaviour based 
system whereby all staff, 
whatever their level, are required 
to report unsafe practices or site 
conditions. All reports are 
compiled on a daily basis in a 
central database which produces 
trends that are analysed and 
create recommendations and 
mitigating steps. This system has 
been used successfully in Shaft 
Sinkers in the past and its re-
introduction has already started 
yielding measurable trends that 
management can recognise and 
respond to in a timely manner.
The Group recorded no significant 
environmental incidents at its 
operations during the year.
As most of the Group’s work 
takes place underground, impacts 
upon the environment are limited. 
Nevertheless, we are committed 
to achieving the highest 
standards of performance and 
the Group’s projects have 
ISO14001 compliant 
environmental management 
systems. During 2013, our sites 
were all audited and retained their 
ISO compliant status with only 
minor comments.

Employees
I would like to thank all of the 
Group’s employees for their efforts 
in 2013. The difficult environment 
the Group is operating in has 
required a number of tough 
decisions about the shape of Shaft 
Sinkers’ business. Despite this 
uncertainty, I am appreciative of 
the commitment our teams have 
shown in continuing to work 
together to make Shaft Sinkers a 
more efficient and competitive 
company. I am convinced that the 
Group will emerge from this 
challenging environment as a 
stronger business, ready to 
capture the significant long-term 
opportunities which exist. 
Outlook
The outlook for 2014 is mixed. 
Whilst prospects for the Group’s 
international business are positive, 
the continued uncertainty in South 
Africa is likely to significantly 
impact our operations there. 
Our work for Kibali Goldmines in 
the DRC is progressing well and 
we expect to meet operational 
and financial targets in 2014. 
Meanwhile, operational 
performance has improved at 
HZL over the first quarter of 2014 
and we have authorised a work 
acceleration programme that will 
reduce delays and potentially 
create further opportunities 
outside the current scope. 
Furthermore, I believe that we will 
finalise terms for the Kazchrome 
project in Kazakhstan in 2014 and 
that the new alliances with Tata 
and NFC will begin to bear fruit 
during the year. 
In South Africa whilst work 
continues at a number of our 
unaffected operations we are 
constantly working on plans to 
mitigate the impact of the ongoing 
strikes by redeploying some of our 
affected work force and assisting 
our clients to reduce cost impacts. 
Although the Labour strike is 
negatively affecting the South 
African platinum and associated 
industries, we believe it will be 
resolved. As a result we continue to 
compete for new projects in the 
country as well as potential 
additional work from existing 
clients. 
Management assess the new 
business pipeline to still be at a 
healthy level with a committed 
order book of GBP238 million at 
year end and outstanding tenders 
worth GBP 970 million.
The Group’s cash position remains 
tight currently, however, we are 
undertaking numerous initiatives 
with clients and suppliers to 
improve short term liquidity as well 
as converting unutilised assets into 
cash. We expect the cash position 
to improve in the second half of the 
year as the benefit of these 
initiatives is felt.

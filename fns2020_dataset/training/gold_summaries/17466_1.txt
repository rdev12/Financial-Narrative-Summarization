 18 Xchanging plc Annual report 2011
Chief Executive Officer’s report
‘ 201 1 has been a 
challenging year and  
a year of progress for 
Xchanging.’
Stopping the bleeding –  
stabilising the business
In the first quarter, it was clear our 
business had stumbled. We had to 
address some key issues. Our workers’ 
compensation claims operation in the 
United States was incurring accelerating 
losses and absorbing cash, our cost base 
was too high, our revenue growth had 
stalled and the cash generation of our 
business was inadequate.
The Four Part Action Plan was launched 
to address these issues. It was designed 
to stop the bleeding and stabilise  
the business:
Part one: Strategic review
We performed a strategic review 
to identify our good businesses and 
those which were underperforming.  
We aimed to unlock value through 
operational improvement, business 
disposal and improvement in the 
economic value of our contract portfolio. 
This resulted in the disposal of our 
loss-making US workers’ compensation 
business and the introduction of a 
number of improvement actions. We 
stabilised our loss-making business in 
Italy, restructured our 76% owned listed 
business in India and facilitated the 
acquisition of the outstanding equity in 
our Broker Services business when Aon 
exercised the put option in the  
Enterprise Partnership. 
We will continue to hone our portfolio of 
businesses to unlock value if we believe 
disposal provides a better opportunity to 
enhance the intrinsic value of the Group. 
We will also examine contract renewals 
diligently and will not renew contracts on 
unprofitable terms even if this involves 
contraction in overall revenue of 
the Group.
Part two: Operational improvements 
and cost reduction
We established a new Executive Board 
structure and a Chief Executive Officer 
Support group. The new Executive Board 
is shown on page 48. It includes the 
business sector heads that have revenue, 
profit and cash flow responsibility and 
accountability together with our Chief 
Financial Officer and our Chief Human 
Resources Officer. 
The Chief Executive Officer Support 
group includes the senior executives with 
functional responsibility for sales and 
marketing, technology, operations, 
implementation, communications, 
corporate and strategic development, 
and legal and corporate governance 
compliance together with the executive 
responsible for the interface with the 
London Insurance market. This structure 
has provided a basis for greater 
collaboration and coordination of 
activities across the Group as well as a 
sharp focus on value creation. Since the 
year end we have appointed 
Subramanian Gopalaratnam as the Head 
of Innovation. He will coordinate the 
development of services and innovative 
ideas around the Group.
We introduced a number of cost cutting 
measures. These resulted in the 
elimination of a number of management 
positions, delivering annualised savings  
in the order of £16 million, of which  
£8 million has benefitted 2011. Savings  Company

will be offset to some extent in 2012 by 
investment in our insurance growth 
strategy and potential expansion into 
Spain. We exited our Head Office and 
relocated the corporate staff into an 
existing, lower cost operational site in 
the City of London. 
We also focused on reducing complexity 
in our business by starting to simplify 
internal company structures and operating 
units, and by eliminating processes and 
methodologies which were burdensome 
for a Group of our size.
We improved our processes for 
forecasting by introducing rolling 
18-month forecasts so that we are more 
aware of developing trends in the 
business and can take corrective action 
as necessary. 
Part three: Revenue growth
The sales and marketing strategy was 
reconfigured. Rather than focusing only 
on developing Enterprise Partnerships 
with large organisations, we chose  
to compete more widely in business 
processing, technology and procurement 
services markets by engaging more 
actively with third party advisers and  
also more aggressively pursuing smaller 
opportunities which we believe will  
grow in time.
Part four: Cash management 
and funding
We successfully re-negotiated our 
banking arrangements with all of 
our existing banks to provide security  
of funding for the foreseeable future. 
Greater focus on investment and better 
management of working capital resulted 
in an improved cash performance.  
The details of the renewed banking 
arrangements are included in the 
Operating and Financial Review.
Getting fit again – building our 
ability to compete effectively  
across the board
As the business stabilised we moved into 
the ‘getting fit’ phase – building our 
ability to compete effectively in our 
markets and to win new business. 
Here we have redefined the strategic 
direction of our business. We have 
clarified our capabilities and our service 
offerings and further developed and 
refreshed the marketing strategy. 
We have reassessed our position in 
our key markets and identified those 
relationships we want to defend 
and those which we believe we can 
grow. We are also focusing on the 
opportunities we believe we can win. 
As a consequence, we have started to 
rebuild our pipeline of opportunities. 
We have also launched an internal 
programme of change management to 
ensure that, as an organisation, we are 
less inward-looking and process-driven 
and more outward-looking and 
customer-focused. This programme is 
aimed at ‘Changing Xchanging’ and  
has a focus on four primary areas –  
see the box above. 
Through this programme we aim to  
have the whole business aligned to the 
challenges ahead of us in 2012. 
A key element of this programme is the 
focus on innovation. We believe that 
inspiring innovation is a key to building 
long-term relationships with our 
customers, helping us to stimulate 
creative change in their businesses and 
so to create value. A great example of 
our approach to innovation was the 
work we performed with YTL during 
2011 in Malaysia, where we supported 
the roll out of the first national 4G 
network and are now supporting the roll 
out of e-learning to 10,000 schools.
Competing to win –  
regenerating growth
So as we move into 2012 we will focus 
on demonstrating our ability to compete 
to win in the markets where we operate. 
We will measure our success in 2012 by 
the momentum which develops from 
our selling effort and the improvement 
in sales and revenue opportunities.

Chief Executive Officer’s review continued
Trading performance
Business Processing Services
Insurance Services has continued to 
sustain steady growth and maintained 
good profitability and cash generation.  
In the UK we saw a steady advance in 
revenue at good margins. Insurance 
Premium Processing and Claims Handling 
continued to be the mainstay of our 
Insurance Services business.
We continued our proactive dialogue 
with Lloyd’s around the Claims 
Transformation Programme. This in due 
course will lead to an increase in choice 
in the market as Lloyd’s no longer 
mandates the processing of claims 
through one service provider. We also 
continue to participate actively in the 
market modernisation programme, 
which should also lead to greater clarity 
around the role of Xchanging in the 
Lloyd’s market in the future.
Our Broker Services business continued 
to progress well and the move to  
100% ownership provides opportunities 
for developing this business further.
In Australia, we successfully renewed the 
workers’ compensation contract with the 
State of Victoria. We also improved the 
financial performance of the contract 
with the State of New South Wales. We 
are planning entry into the US Insurance 
business processing market in 2012.
Financial Services performed satisfactorily 
in Germany but overall financial 
performance was affected by the losses 
in the Italian business, Kedrios. 
In Germany, we saw further expansion  
of our investment account administration 
processing for Independent Financial 
Advisers within Fondsdepot Bank, 
reducing the dependence of that 
business on Allianz Global Investors.  
At Xchanging Transaction Bank, we were 
able to improve margins as a result of 
cost reduction. In Italy we reduced cost 
and improved operating performance  
as we pursued the plan to achieve a 
breakeven position by the end of 2013.
Our near shore facility at Hof in Germany 
and offshore services facilities in India 
continued actively to support Financial 
Services during the year with much of 
the securities processing business and 
the investment account administration 
business being processed in locations.
Technology
The Technology business was 
disappointing. Our investment in 
resources in our Infrastructure 
management services business ahead of 
anticipated revenue growth caused some 
cost recovery issues when the revenue did 
not materialise. However, we continued  
to achieve good results from our major 
customers at the London Metal Exchange, 
Gatwick Airport and Northgate. Actions 
have been taken to reduce cost and to 
improve cost recoverability. The renewal 
of the IT services contract with the 
London Metal Exchange was secured  
at the end of 201 1.
Following on from a strong year in 2010 
our software business only achieved a 
breakeven result as there were no 
additional sales of our newly developing 
insurance application platform. We have 
defined a new go-to-market strategy 
which should lead to a resumption of 
growth in 2012 through a combination 
of conversions from legacy products, 
direct sales and sales through channel 
partners. Annuity maintenance and 
licence fees continued for the other 
insurance software product offerings. 
Actions taken to reduce costs and the 
benefit of the growing relationship with 
YTL in Malaysia have moved the 
Application management business, 
primarily providing application systems 
development and management services, 
into profit.
Procurement and Other BPO Services
This was a transition year for Procurement 
and Other BPO Services. Many of the 
smaller legacy contracts in the UK 
business were renewed and we 
successfully secured the L’Oréal contract 
in Europe and the BAE Systems contract  Company

in the US. These major contract wins have 
provided good momentum for the 
business going into 2012 when it is 
expected these new contracts will 
contribute to profitability. It was 
disappointing that we did not secure the 
renewal of the BAE Systems Human 
Resources contract. We will continue to 
provide services under this contract to 
BAE Systems through 2012 and we will 
actively participate in the migration of the 
service to a new provider. We continue  
to seek new business opportunities in  
HR services.
All our segments are supported by our 
low cost operations in India where we 
have significant depth of expertise. These 
operations saw revenue and profit 
growth as we continued to secure 
incremental accounts and controlled 
costs tightly. We are also seeing 
increasingly encouraging signs of 
growing activity in the local market. 
Recently we have been awarded pilot 
projects in the Indian domestic market 
with L&T Insurance and L&T Financial 
Services. There is much emphasis in this 
business on expanding through proactive 
account management with existing 
customers and growing accounts from 
small beginnings.
Strategic direction
We expect the growth of the Business 
Processing market to continue for some 
time to come (see Market Review on 
page 14). There is no doubt that the 
market is changing. Once the focus  
of very large businesses, outsourced 
business processing and technology 
services are increasingly available to  
lesser sized businesses as developing 
technology makes available ‘everything-
as-a-service’.
As the economies of the developed 
world struggle to show growth we see 
opportunities to provide services that 
enable our customers to reduce their 
cost base through outsourcing and 
innovative management of processes 
and the use of technology. We also see 
the so-called ‘developing’ economies of 
the world offering opportunities for 
growth as new and developing 
businesses seek to secure services 
through a form of service delivery 
framework made available through 
advances in remote and Cloud 
computing technology.
We are aware of the competitiveness  
of the markets in which we operate and 
seek to differentiate our offering through 
technology, our ability to innovate and to 
provide superior service delivery.
The focus of our service offering will be 
procurement services and indirect cost 
reduction; the provision of offshore 
services; Business-Processing-as-a-Service 
(‘BPaaS’), particularly in areas where  
we have industry strength; insurance 
software, complex processing and  
critical technology; and transformation 
services (particularly in the financial 
services market).
Our industry strength remains in 
Insurance Services and Financial Services 
but we operate in a number of other 
industries such as logistics, healthcare, 
manufacturing, real estate and aerospace 
and defence.
‘ We are aware of the competitiveness of the markets in 
which we operate and seek to differentiate our offering 
through technology, our ability to innovate and to 
provide superior service delivery.’
Outlook
We achieved a number of significant 
milestones for the business in 2011 as we 
implemented the Four Part Action Plan. 
Xchanging is on a sound financial footing 
and has made significant progress in the 
reshaping of its business portfolio. I am 
pleased with the progress we have made.
Now that the business is stabilised we 
are building our ability to compete 
effectively in our key markets so that we 
are in a stronger position to win new 
business. 2012 will be the year in which 
we demonstrate our ability to compete 
to win, and as we build momentum, any 
improvement in year-on-year profitability 
will come from the continuing benefit of 
cost savings made in 2011. Our success in 
2012 will be measured by the extent to 
which we turn new sales opportunities 
into contracts to grow profitable revenue 
in 2013 and beyond.

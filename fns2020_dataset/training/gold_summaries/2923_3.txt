Care UK’s strong performance

benefits of investment in the 
emerging healthcare market.

The most notable financial 
performance in the group has been 
in the Health Care division, reflecting 
both the full year effect of the 
Mercury Health acquisition and the 
part year benefit of acquiring full 
ownership of Partnership Health 
Group (“PHG”). Most existing 
services within this division have 
now reached an operational steady 
state and are achieving their targeted 
levels of returns. With revenue and 
adjusted operating profit increasing 
by 73% and 112% respectively, 
the division represented around 
30% of both revenue and adjusted 
operating profit. This share is 
expected to show further material 
increase during the coming years 
from the full year benefit of the 
acquisition of PHG and as new 
services are commissioned 
and reach their planned 
contribution levels.
From its start‑up position in 2004, 
Care UK’s Health Care business 
is now widely recognised as 
the sector’s largest and most 
influential independent sector 
provider of healthcare services 
to NHS patients.
Overall, the aggregate revenue of 
the three Social Care divisions was 
10% higher than the previous year 
(of which 6% was organic) with 
adjusted operating profit being 
4% higher. Solid performances in 
both Residential Care and much 
of the Specialist Care division were 
partly offset by contract start‑up 
challenges in Community Care and, 
within the Specialist Care division, 
the continuing difficulties 
in Children’s Services (which 
represents just 4% of total revenue).
Compensation negotiations
Compensation discussions continue 
with the Department of Health 
(“DoH”) regarding the termination 
of the West Midlands diagnostics 
contract, which ceased providing 
services in February 2008, as well as 
claims for wasted bid costs relating 
to Phase 2 Independent Sector 
Treatment Centre (“ISTC”) contracts. 
As reported at the half year, our 
review of the consequences of 
the termination has resulted in 
certain impairment charges being 
made. Satisfactory resolution of 
these negotiations is expected 
in the current financial year.
Employees and quality
People that are drawn to becoming 
health and social care professionals 
are of a special nature and Care UK 
is extremely fortunate to have a 
workforce that is dedicated to 
providing excellent care.
As a sector leader, Care UK sets the 
highest standards of both care service 
quality and value – whether services 
are purchased by commissioners or 
directly by individuals. The group 
invests extensively in recruiting the 
right people, in training and in 
quality review resources to underpin 
this commitment. Equally important 
is to encourage a culture that is 
both open and honest so that 
any shortcomings are readily 
identified and resolved.
It is pleasing to note that across 
the Social Care divisions, ratings 
by the Commission for Social Care 
Inspection indicate an improvement 
of some 10% in services assessed 
“excellent” or “good” to 80%, 
ahead of market comparators. 
Similarly it is encouraging to note 
that in our Health Care treatment 
centres, independent patient

survey data indicates that all 
patients are satisfied with their 
experience, with 95% reporting 
this as excellent or very good. In 
the most recent patient satisfaction 
surveys undertaken, the PHG centres 
have out‑performed the top 20% 
of NHS hospitals on every one of 
over 20 measures. All Care UK 
and PHG centres have continued 
to maintain their record of having 
zero hospital acquired infections 
for the “superbugs” MRSA and 
clostridium difficile.
Care UK is committed to 
developing an organisation 
that reflects the UK’s diversity. 
Our aim is to attract and develop 
talented people who relate to the 
needs of our patients and service 
users, who aspire to develop 
optimal solutions and who will 
drive continual improvement.
Dividend
The board is recommending 
a final dividend of 3.10p per 
share (2007: 2.80p), an increase 
of 11%, which will be paid on 
18 February 2009 to shareholders 
on the register on 23 January 2009. 
This increase is consistent with the 
Brand 
development A
A review of branding started in 2007 culminated 
in the launch of a revised Care UK brand this year. 
The revised branding, featured for the first time in 
this report, emerged from extensive research into 
the attitudes and opinions of staff, service users, 
patients, commissioners and opinion leaders. 
It will enable us to signal that our market proposition 
has changed significantly in recent years in response 
to a fast changing market, with consumer choice 
a major driver of change. 
It is a bolder, more consumer friendly brand 
and tested well in market and staff surveys. 
The brand is communicated through a new 
visual identity, the proposition: “fulfilling lives” 
and revised brand values. A new group website 
was launched in parallel.

previously stated policy of growing 
dividends ahead of inflation whilst 
maintaining a level of earnings 
cover appropriate to the group’s 
growth objectives. Dividend cover 
in 2008 is 6.3 times, measured 
against adjusted basic earnings 
per share (2007: 6.5 times).
Outlook
The group’s Social Care and Health 
Care businesses benefit from high 
levels of contracted revenue and 
the non‑discretionary nature of 
our services offer relative market 
stability. The group is benefiting 
from its well managed funding 
arrangements. The group’s core 
debt facilities are fully committed 
until February 2015 with material 
headroom of over £80m to facilitate 
further growth. In addition, the 
group’s balance sheet is further 
supported by the market 
valuations of its property assets 
being substantially higher than 
their book values, even in the 
prevailing market conditions.
Our immediate focus is on 
the continuity of service at the 
two Wave 1 ISTC contracts, in 
Plymouth and Barlborough Links, 
that are due to complete their 
initial contract term during 2010. 
We are encouraged by the level 
of engagement with both local 
Primary Care Trusts (“PCTs”) and 
the DoH and we are optimistic 
that Care UK will be able to 
continue operating these centres, 
with acceptable financial returns, 
beyond their initial contract periods. 
Of equal importance to the group’s 
strategy is the continuation of our 
success in our well established 
Social Care services and the recovery 
of operational performance where 
it has fallen short of our own high 
expectations. For some time, 
Care UK has considered care 
home acquisition valuations to 
be stretched and we have chosen 
not to participate in recent market 
consolidation as a consequence. 
However, the board perceives 
that over the coming period 
valuations are likely to become 
more realistic and that a modest 
acquisition plan, targeted at single 
homes or small groups of homes, 
might become a part of the group’s 
strategy in this area.
Both the current Government 
and the Conservative Party have 
reaffirmed their strategies for the 
evolution of a competitive market 
for NHS services and we anticipate 
further growth in both our Health 
Care and Social Care businesses as 
a consequence. We are currently 
bidding for selective opportunities 
in the NHS’ “Equitable Access” 
procurement for primary care 
services, and we anticipate a 
further substantial range of 
opportunities to flow from 
the NHS strategy to outsource 
and introduce competition for 
PCT Provider Arms, that represent 
expenditure of around £10bn per 
annum. Services provided range 
from community healthcare 
services and hospitals to mental 
health and learning disabilities.
Having successfully created 
competencies strongly aligned 
with the integration of secondary 
and primary healthcare and 
with social care services, 
Care UK is strongly positioned 
to benefit from further service 
and market reform, offering 
good opportunities for delivering 
exceptional long‑term value 
to shareholders.

 GROUP
the financial y ear ended 28 april 2013 (“the year”) was a 52-week year. in order 
to make a comparison to the previous period, which was a 53-week year, all 
references to financial performance in respect of the income statement, cash 
flow and business reviews are made by reference to a pro-forma 2012 52-week 
basis unless otherwise specified.
for the y ear we increased group revenue by 20.9% to £2,186m. this was 
primarily due to the r etail division, where we grew revenues by 22.7%, including 
a 17.6% growth in total sports r etail coupled with the premium lifestyle 
division, which contributed revenues of £128m.
group gross margin in the year increased by 40 basis points from 40.5% to 
40.9%. total sports r etail division gross margin increased by 20 basis points to 
41.4% (fy12: 41.2%), while brands division gross margin increased to 44.9% 
(fy12: 41.2%).
group operating costs increased 22.5% to £607.9m (fy12: £496.2m). sports 
r etail and brands division operating costs were £491.0m (fy12: £400.0m) and 
£66.6m (fy12: £58.8m), respectively.
OvERvIEW OF FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 
i am pleased to report a further year of strong profit growth for sports direct. the results for the year have benefited from the uefa 
european championships and the london olympics, but have been achieved in a retail environment that remains challenging.  
the group has grown consistently, and the resilience and flexibility of our business model continues to allow us to offer an 
unparalleled product range at the best available prices. w e will continue to be the consumers’ champion.
56 new sports r etail stores opened during the year in the uk and europe, with 
the group continuing to put the consumer at the forefront of our business by 
offering the best combination of product range and value for money. whilst we 
are the clear market leader in the uk sports r etail sector, we are also pleased to 
have broadened our customer base in new areas, such as lifestyle and f ashion, 
and built on our strong retail infrastructure and systems.
our p remium lifestyle division has continued to expand, having acquired 114 
r epublic stores from the administrator in february 2013. the division offers its 
customers an enhanced shopping experience, following the previous acquisition 
of companies including usc, flannels, cruise and v an mildert.
following the success of our 2009 employee bonus share scheme, the group 
launched a new four-year scheme in 2011, covering the period fy12 to fy15, 
with challenging underlying ebitda targets of £215m, £250m, £260m and 
£300m respectively. w e are delighted to inform you that both the first and 
the second of these targets have been achieved and we would like to take 
this opportunity to thank our colleagues for their outstanding contributions 
over the past year. there is no doubt that the schemes continue to be a major 
contributing factor in improving the group’s staff retention. those employees 
that were involved in the 2009 scheme received their first share rewards in 
august 2012 and we are pleased that august 2013 will see the second part of 
the 2009 bonus share scheme vest and we look forward to seeing our fellow 
colleagues well-rewarded for their efforts.

Sports Direct plc Annual Report 2013
18  r eflecting the success of our approach – balancing revenues and gross margin, 
while maintaining a tight focus on operating costs – we grew group underlying 
ebitda (pre-scheme costs) for the year by 22.1% to £287.9m (fy12: £235.7m). 
within this underlying ebitda , we increased the total r etail division ebitda by 
23.8% to £260.9m (fy12: £210.7m) while the brands division ebitda increased 
by 8.0% to £27.0m (fy12: £25.0m).
excluded from underlying ebitda is a £22.1m (fy12: £20.7m) charge in  
respect of the 2009 and 2011 employee bonus share schemes and the 
executive bonus share schemes. this charge has been taken centrally and, 
except in note 4 to the accounts, is not reflected in divisional (r etail and brands) 
numbers in this report. 
for the y ear, group underlying profit before tax increased 39.6% to £208.1m, 
primarily as a result of the £52.2m increase in (pre-scheme costs) ebitda 
and £9.9m decrease in depreciation and amortisation, offset by the £1.4m 
increase in employee bonus share scheme charges. underlying eps for the year 
increased by 43.3% to 26.85p (fy12: 18.74p). 
net debt at 28 april 2013 was £154.0m (29 april 2012: £145.2m), which is 0.58 
times reported ebitda . r eported ebitda includes realised foreign exchange 
gains/losses in selling and administration costs and the employee bonus share 
scheme charges.

UK SPORTS RETAIL 
uk sports r etail revenue growth continues to be primarily driven by our retail and logistics skills – providing the widest choice of 
products at the best value with universal availability.
uk sports r etail sales were up 17.3% to £1,574.9m (fy12: £1,342.4m). sales and gross profit from the former JJb stores are 
excluded from uk sports r etail revenue and margin and are included in uk wholesale and other.
sales in the first half benefited from the uefa european championships and 
the london olympics, although sales in the second half of the y ear were still up 
16.4% to £778.0m (fy12 h2: £667.7m). gross margins for the second half of the 
year improved to 39.9% (fy12 h2: 39.7%). gross margin for the y ear increased 
by 10 basis points to 41.1% (fy12: 41.0%). w e have invested significantly in 
gross margin throughout the year.
uk sports r etail like-for-like gross contribution, which excludes online, increased 
by a record 11.2%, marking the fourth consecutive year of growth in this kpi 
(fy12: +0.7% / fy11: +6.6% / fy10: +3.4%). uk sports r etail like-for-like 
contribution is defined as the percentage change in gross contribution in the 
successive 12-month period. a like-for-like store is one that has been trading 
for the full 12 months in both periods and has not been affected by a significant 
change, such as a major refurbishment. the number of stores included in this 
year’s kpi is 275 (fy12: 290).
operating costs increased by 18.8% to £409.4m (fy12: £344.5m). operating 
costs in h2 increased by 13.9% to £214.5m (fy12 h2: £188.4m). store wages 
were up 18.0% but as a percentage of sales increased only 0.2% to 8.8% 
(fy12: 8.6%), in spite of a substantial investment in store staff. uk sports 
r etail premises costs increased by only 1.5% due to reduced rent following 
the purchase in the prior year of freehold properties previously rented, and the 
ongoing process of store relocations and rent renegotiations. 
other operating costs were up 34.2% to £157.0m (fy12: £117m) which is due 
to increased warehouse and storage costs to support the growth in our online 
business and increased overheads relating to the obligations acquired from 
the administrator of JJb. the majority of this increase came in h1, with other 
operating costs in h2 only increasing by 15.1% to £84m (fy12: £73m).
operating costs were also reduced by a release of the onerous lease provision  
of £14.6m due to the closure of unprofitable stores, the sub-let of previously 
vacant space and a strategic decision to invest in other stores previously 
planned for closure.
underlying ebitda for uk sports r etail was £247.7m (fy12: £207.7m), an 
increase of 19.2% for the year. this increase was driven by a £111.7m increase 
in gross profit (including uk wholesale and other) due to the growth in store 
contribution and online sales offset by the £64.9m increase in operating costs.
the group’s retail businesses performed strongly in a difficult economic 
environment. our retail model, offering outstanding value to our customers, 
remains resilient, both in the uk and internationally. throughout the y ear,  
we continued to focus on offering the customer the most comprehensive 
product range, the best availability and value while reducing our costs  
wherever possible.
Sports Direct plc Annual Report 2013
20  employee training has undergone a significant amount of investment over the 
past few years. this year alone in excess of 40,000 hours have been invested 
into the training and development of our employees. our training courses mainly 
take place at our state-of-the-art national t raining f acility in shirebrook where 
sessions are led by our experienced teams. w e offer a wide portfolio of courses, 
which are continuously being changed and refined, with the ultimate aim of 
improving trainee product knowledge and customer experience.
the nike t raining academy is a key part of our shirebrook national t raining 
f acility and the only one of its kind in the world. w e are also continuing to 
work with adidas and puma to provide training in order to support our in-store 
campaigns and to gain knowledge of specialised products. new p uma training 
rooms at shirebrook were opened during april 2013.
group marketing has continued to be a key part of our growth strategy. 
investment around traditional media channels such as tv and print were intrinsic 
to our marketing plans around the 2012 summer of sport.
the sportsdirect.com brochure was our biggest ever at 1,092 pages, which was 
an increase of 50% on the year before. two million copies were distributed both 
in store and with the delivery of online orders.
online revenue has increased by 52.1% from £174.0m to 
£264.6m in the year and represented 15.0% of total sports 
r etail sales (fy12: 11.6%). 
w e remain focused on the further development of our successful multi-channel 
offer. order fulfilment and information technology solutions are developed 
in-house with full back-up support from our national distribution centre in 
shirebrook, derbyshire. the website has benefited from the group’s investment 
in online product range and availability, the launch of the new online platform in 
november 2012 and a further growth in recognition of the online brand with 376 
of the uk store fascia now branded sportsdirect .com.

UK SPORTS RETAIL continued
our store portfolio remains constantly under review with the performance of 
each store and ways of maximising performance being regularly examined. 
during the year we opened 37 and closed 36 stores. w e have closed 113  
stores since 2008 as the mix of our portfolio continues to evolve. w e increased 
our period end square-footage to c. 4.0m square feet (fy12: c. 3.9m).
in the 12 months to 28 april 2013, rent reviews have been agreed on 33 stores. 
the average increase in rent was 2.48% (0.48% annual equivalent). there are 
currently 42 rent reviews outstanding with a further 40 falling due in 2013-14. 
our lease expiry profile over all core stores (excluding lillywhites p iccadilly)  
is now 6 years, allowing a significant amount of flexibility within our portfolio to 
adapt our format to the rapidly changing multi-channel environment. 
in the current financial year, we are targeting to open 25-30 stores. w e 
anticipate closing more stores than we open in fy14. this is in line with our 
aim of maintaining four million square feet of retail space, but with an increased 
average store size. w e have already opened six in the first quarter, including  
two relocations.

The Business Review management & governance financial statements & notes additional information UK RETAIL - PREMIUM LIFESTYLE 
during the year we have continued our expansion of the premium lifestyle 
division. in July 2012 we purchased a majority stake in the flannels group, 
and in february 2013, 114 stores and certain assets were acquired from the 
administrators of the fashion retailer r epublic. following negotiations with 
landlords, 85 r epublic stores remain open. both acquisitions have expanded the 
breadth of our premium lifestyle offering. p ost year end we have also acquired 
the remaining 20% stake in cruise.
the results of r epublic are excluded from the above analysis as the fascia had 
not been fully integrated into the group by the end of the year. for the nine 
weeks since acquisition, r epublic made a loss of £4.5m ebitda .
the results for fy13 include a full year’s trading for usc, cruise and v an mildert 
and nine months for flannels. the fy12 results included nine months of trading 
for usc and cruise and two months for v an mildert.
sales for the division in the year were £128.4m (fy12: £73.5m), gross margin 
was 43.4% which is 100 basis points lower than the prior year (fy12: 44.4%). 
the divisional ebitda (excluding r epublic) was £5.4m, after the release of an 
onerous lease provision of £2.0m (fy12: loss of £7.8m).
usc online sales increased by 84.7% to £10.9m (fy12: £5.9m), driven by the 
adoption of the group’s fulfilment systems and online platform.
at the year end, the division traded from 74 stores with five targeted fascias:

the group has a 50% shareholding in the heatons chain which operates 14 
sports direct stores in northern ireland and 26 sports stores in the r epublic  
of ireland. during the year we opened a new store in iceland through our  
25% shareholding. 
all of the stores in the previous table are operated by companies wholly owned 
by the group, except portugal, where the group owns 50.1%. as part of the 
accelerated growth programme in our european subsidiary, we opened 19 
new stores in europe and entered four new countries. as at 28 april 2013, 
international r etail operated from a total retail sales space of c. 1.1m sq. ft 
(fy12: c. 0.895m sq. ft).
importantly, with all of our new and existing stores in europe, local management 
are working hard to ensure that all stores are committed to the operational 
efficiencies and standards that exist across the uk sports stores.
our strategy remains to identify partners in new territories while continuing 
to expand our operations in the countries where we currently trade. for fy14, 
and in line with our accelerated european expansion, we are targeting eight to 
12 new stores and two to three new territories. in the first quarter, we have 
already opened two stores in poland and one in spain. in conjunction with the 
acquisition recently announced in austria and the baltic region, we are now 
active in 19 countries across europe.

CHIEF ExECUTIvE’S REPORT & BUSINESS REvIEW continued
Sports Direct plc Annual Report 2013
24  in march 2012 we acquired the firetrap brand and assets from the administrator. 
during fy13 the business underwent a complete customer and operational 
review, resulting in significant cost savings and a more streamlined operation. 
the brands division remained acquisitive during the y ear, acquiring vandanel 
premier, a distributor of football branded clothing and equipment and also 
w aterline, a wholesale fishing business.
licensing revenues in the y ear were up 12.0% to £30.7m (fy12: £27.4m). 
w e signed 87 new licence agreements, covering multiple brands and product 
categories, with minimum contracted values of $53m over the life of the 
agreements. w e remain on track for licence income to achieve a compound 
average growth rate (cagr) of 11%, reaching at least $60m of licensing 
revenues by fy15.
longer term, we still regard licensing as the key driver of brands division 
profitability and crucial for the overall growth of the brands business. the main 
growth areas are expected to be asia p acific and the americas which should 
compensate for a tougher licensing landscape in the uk and europe.
operating costs increased by 19.4% to £66.6m (fy12: £55.8m) which includes 
a £3.0m cost for the firetrap reorganisation. excluding these costs underlying 
ebitda therefore increased by 8.0% to £27.0m (fy12: £25.0m).

wholesale revenues were up 5.8% to £178.3m (fy12: £168.5m), driven by strong performances in our north american businesses. 
brands gross margin increased by 370 basis points to 44.9% (fy12: 41.2%). wholesale gross margin rose to 35.4% (fy12: 31.7%).
w e continue to focus on developing world-class products that 
are endorsed by leading athletes on the field of play. a recent 
addition to our team of key brand ambassadors is r obson 
green. r obson, the face of channel 5’s extreme fishing, is the 
ambassador of the fishing range developed under our iconic 
dunlop brand. 
the group recognised that fishing is a sport which involves 
significant mass participation and therefore developed 
product ranges of superior quality and great value, to suit the 
needs and value expectations of our customers.

The Business Review management & governance financial statements & notes additional information
dunlop brand ambassador - r obson green EMPLOYEES
sports direct has made great progress and a large proportion of this is due to 
the hard work and loyalty of our c. 24,000 staff throughout the business.  
i am overwhelmed by the contributions that have been made by our employees 
towards achieving an exciting future for the group. i believe that the dedication 
of our employees has placed us in an extremely strong position in the market in 
what is most definitely a difficult time for most retailers. the past contributions 
from our employees make me confident that we can replicate our successes as 
we look forward to the future.
the employee bonus share schemes have been a fundamental tool which 
the group has used to promote, incentivise and motivate its staff. sharing the 
responsibility of achieving these targets was matched by the potential benefits 
to employees if the targets were met. the schemes have been crucial to 
influencing staff behaviour and maximising the group performance. 
the 2009 employee bonus share scheme was the first scheme which we 
trialled, vesting in august 2012 and august 2013. all of the elements of the 
scheme were met and the first awards were successfully vested for eligible 
employees in 2012. the second award of shares will vest for eligible employees 
in august 2013 amounting to approximately 21 million shares. the second 
awards were to the value of 75% of base pay for the majority of employees, and 
25% of base pay for those employees who joined the group later but still within 
the rules of the scheme.
to the extent that a significant number of eligible employees elect to sell 
some or all of their shares, whilst the company has no obligation to buy back 
the shares, the board will consider a number of options open to it, including 
whether to: (i) implement an on-market buy back of shares pursuant to the 
authority given by shareholders at the company’s agm in 2012; or (ii) fund the 
company’s employee benefit t rust so as to allow it to acquire shares in the 
market to replace those shares transferred to eligible employees pursuant to  
the vesting.
a further incentive for our employees has been the introduction of the 2011 
employee bonus share scheme. the 2011 scheme has been developed 
to incentivise and motivate our current employees in pursuit of our shared 
group objectives. the on-going growth and performance of the group may be 
attributed to the successful adoption of the 2009 and 2011 employee bonus 
share schemes. employees who have received bonuses under the 2009 scheme 
could be eligible for further awards under the 2011 scheme, and we hope to 
retain our valued employees by offering such rewards. this year 15.5% of our  
uk employees left the business, down from 17% in fy12.
the underlying ebitda targets (before the costs of the scheme), of £215m in 
fy12 and £250m in fy13, have been achieved. the targets for fy14 and fy15 
are £260m and £300m respectively. these further targets, coupled with the 
individual employee’s satisfactory personal performance, must all be met in 
order for the scheme to vest in august 2015 and 2017. with approximately 6m 
shares due to vest in 2015 and approximately 17m shares due to vest in 2017,  
it is important that we continue to work together towards these shared goals.
2011 Employee Bonus Share Scheme
ebitda targets of:
• £215m in fy12 (achieved £235.7m)
• £250m in fy13 (achieved £287.9m)
• £260m in fy14
• £300m in fy15
all four targets have to be met. maximum award of 23m shares, to include  
c. 3,000 employees.

26  OUR STRATEGY
Objective So Far What Next?
Identify
In-Store the group focuses on its stores to ensure the best presentation of our product 
range. our product collections provide a ‘good/better/best’ presentation to 
ensure our customers find the right product at the right price. our specialist 
collaborations with sherunsheruns and soccer scene @ the boot r oom 
provide a high level of customer service. our multi-channel approach also 
gives flexibility to our customers.
the group continues to enhance its in-store offering with further dedicated 
areas for specialist product collections:
• european golf
• swimshop.co.uk
• w aterline
• dragoncarp direct
• field & t rek
Acquisitions in fy13 the group acquired the key assets of JJb including the distribution 
centre in wigan and the slazenger golf brand. the group also acquired a 51% 
stake in the flannels group for the p remium lifestyle division and added used 
tackle and w aterline to expand the fishing product offering. 
in february 2013 the group acquired various assets of the fashion retailer 
r epublic including the stock, 114 stores and the website.
the group continues to identify suitable opportunities to expand the product 
range, our specialist collaborations and the premium lifestyle division.
Invest
Store Portfolio since april 2012, uk sports r etail has opened 28 core stores and closed 10 
core stores. the group also opened nine and closed 26 non-core stores. 
during fy13, international r etail opened 19 new stores and closed five. as at 
28 april 2013, international r etail operated wholly owned subsidiaries in nine 
countries and a 50.1% partnership in portugal.
the group also opened a new store in iceland as a joint venture and has a 50% 
stake in the heatons chain in northern ireland and r epublic of ireland.
the group intends to continue to enhance its store portfolio in both the uk and 
internationally. the group will continue with the strategy to identify strategic 
partners in new territories while expanding operations in those countries 
where we currently have a presence. plans are in place to expand international 
r etail operations into all countries that have adopted the euro.
People our employees have contributed substantially towards our growth and 
success. w e are consistently investing in the training and development of 
our employees to ensure that they are incentivised and recognised for their 
contribution. the 2009 and 2011 employee bonus share schemes are an 
important contributor to employee motivation and group performance. the 
targets of the 2009 employee bonus share scheme were achieved and the 
second award is due to vest in august 2013. the 2011 employee bonus share 
scheme has been embraced by our employees and they have worked hard to 
contribute towards the ebitda targets to date. if the additional group targets 
are achieved, members of the 2011 scheme will be rewarded with shares in 
the group.
due to the success of the first bonus share scheme, we continue to 
encourage and motivate employees with the 2011 employee bonus  
share scheme. 
Develop
Website online r etail sales currently represent 15.0% of total sports r etail revenue, up 
from 11.6% in fy12.
aided by the new platform launched in november 2012, our monthly unique 
visitors have risen 50.9% on fy12 and the average basket size has risen 4.6% 
to £59.50.
our conversion ratio of unique visitors who go on to make a purchase has 
risen from 5.4% to 5.7%.
online revenue continues to be an area of significant growth and the group 
continues to look at opportunities to develop this revenue stream further. the 
website has benefited from the group’s investment in online product range and 
availability, and from recognition of the online brand now that 376 stores have 
the sportsdirect .com fascia.
the launch of sportsdirectnews .com in november 2012 provides a further 
opportunity to drive incremental visitors to our website.
Promote
Brands the group’s portfolio includes a wide variety of world famous sport, fashion 
and lifestyle brands. the group’s r etail division sells products under these 
group brands in its stores, and the brands division exploits the brands through 
its wholesale and licensing businesses.
the brands division wholesale business sells the brands’ core products,  
such as dunlop tennis rackets and slazenger tennis balls, to wholesale 
customers and distributors throughout the world. this results in far wider 
distribution of the products than would be the case if their sale was restricted 
to group stores.
the wholesale business also wholesales childrenswear and apparel. the 
licensing business licenses third parties to apply group-owned brands to 
non-core products manufactured and distributed by those third parties. w e 
currently have in excess of 300 licensees in over 100 countries. the brands 
division manages these licensees to ensure global brand consistency and the 
international success of our group brands.
the brands division is closely involved in the development of licensed products 
and monitors licensees and their manufacturers to ensure product quality, 
presentation and consistency with the appropriate brand strategy. the brands 
division continues to sponsor a variety of prestigious events and retains a 
portfolio of globally-recognised, high-profile athletes.
the brands division strategy includes further expansion into asia, as well 
as the americas. such expansion will provide us with more opportunities to 
expand the global presence and international appeal of our group brands.
in order to maintain brand awareness and authenticity, the brands division 
will continue to invest in the development of core products for wholesale 
customers and distributors throughout the world.

The Business Review management & governance financial statements & notes additional information MAIN TRENDS AND FACTORS LIKELY TO AFFECT THE FUTURE 
DEvELOPMENT AND PERFORMANCE OF THE GROUP ’S BUSINESSES
the group’s retail businesses will undoubtedly be affected by the economic 
climate and changes therein. movements in interest rates and exchange rates 
affect the businesses directly and consumer confidence and spending is affected 
by a wide range of factors including employment, tax and interest rates, house 
prices and the general ‘feel-good factor’; factors beyond the group’s influence. 
all of the above apply equally to our brands businesses, both wholesale and 
licensing. r eduction in customer demand is reflected in the wholesaling and 
licensing business, as orders and royalties are affected. moreover, in difficult 
economic times, suppliers come under increasing pressure to reduce their prices 
to their customers and all suppliers run the risk of their customers ceasing to 
trade or reducing demand for their products. 
difficult economic conditions can also make it difficult for suppliers to obtain 
credit insurance in respect of some customers, leaving the supplier with a 
difficult question of whether or not to supply and, if they do, with the attendant 
risk of bad debts.
later in this report, we comment on risks and uncertainties that relate to the 
group’s businesses and while we manage to reduce risks, where possible, the 
likelihood of their occurring and their impact if they do, are factors that could 
influence the group or part of it.
the group applies hedge accounting, which is in line with other major retailers. 
this reduces an element of potential volatility in reported profit.
CHIEF ExECUTIvE’S REPORT & BUSINESS REvIEW continued
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES RELATING TO THE GROUP’S BUSINESS 
Internal Controls and Risk Management  
the board has a responsibility to govern the group in the interest of the 
shareholders. the board is responsible for setting strategic objectives and part 
of this involves assessing the risks involved. risks are an inherent part of the 
business world and, due to the nature of the business, the group is exposed to 
a wide variety of these. in order to minimise the effect of potentially damaging 
effects to the group, the board ensures these are managed and monitored 
effectively via a framework of controls and robust procedures.
The Group’s Approach to Risk 
the identification and management of risk is a continuous process, and the 
group’s system of internal controls and the business continuity programmes are 
key elements of that. the group maintains a system of controls to manage the 
business and to protect its assets with the development of contingency plans 
and rapid response to changing circumstances and does much to mitigate the 
risks facing the group. the group continues to invest in people, systems and in 
it to manage the group’s operations and its finances effectively and efficiently.
executive management teams are responsible for the identification, analysis, 
evaluation and mitigation of the significant risks applicable to their areas of 
business. these comprise of directors as well as of senior managers.
the teams meet regularly to discuss the identified risks, and how these 
should be reviewed and monitored. the board ensures that the appropriate 
arrangements are in place under which employees can raise concerns about 
possible financial or other impropriety, which are then appropriately investigated. 
these arrangements include formal grievance procedures and employee 
confidential hotlines.
the board is assisted by the audit committee in fulfilling its overview 
responsibilities, reviewing the reporting of financial and non-financial information 
to shareholders and the audit process, satisfying itself that appropriate systems 
of internal control and risk management are in place and are serving to identify 
and manage risk.
the group operates a r etail support unit which provides strong operational 
internal audit services in the r etail division, and there are procedures in place in 
the brands division to monitor and control licensees.
the external auditors are invited to attend all meetings of the audit committee, 
save for those parts of any meeting when the committee reviews the 
performance of the auditors and when the committee is having separate 
discussions with the group finance director.
with the exception of heatons, who are the group’s only material associate,  
the group’s system of internal control and risk management and its 
effectiveness is monitored and reviewed by the board, the audit committee  
and management, and the board believes that the group has maintained 
throughout the year and up to the date of approval of the annual report and 
accounts an effective embedded system of internal control and has complied 
with the turnbull guidance.
the systems of internal control and risk management are designed to manage, 
rather than eliminate, the risk of failing to achieve business objectives.
Risk Policies and Procedures 
business plans and budgets for each business include financial and strategic 
targets against which performance is monitored. monitoring includes the 
examination of and changes to rolling annual and quarterly forecasts, monthly 
measurement of actual achievement against key performance targets and plans, 
and weekly reviews of performance.
the group has clear procedures for the approval and control of expenditure. 
strategic investment decisions involving both capital and revenue expenditure 
are subject to formal detailed appraisal and review according to approval  
levels set by the board. operating expenditure is controlled within each  
business with approval levels for such expenditure being determined by the 
individual businesses.
the group has a formal whistle-blowing policy for employees who wish to raise 
any issues or concerns relating to the group’s activities on a confidential basis.
1. the risks are identified
2. the risks are evaluated

Sports Direct plc Annual Report 2013
28  Key Risks 
Control environment 
the group’s operating procedures include a comprehensive system for reporting 
financial and non-financial information to the board including:
• preparation of three years of strategy plans for business development;
• preparation and review of annual budgets; and
• review of the business at each board meeting, focussing on any new risks 
arising (for example key changes in the market).
Control procedures 
detailed operational procedures have been developed for each of the group’s 
operating businesses that embody key controls. the implications of changes in 
law and regulations are taken into account within these procedures.
Financial reporting process 
the group has in place internal control and risk management systems in 
relation to the group’s financial reporting process and the group’s process for 
the preparation of consolidated accounts. these include clearly defined lines 
of accountability and delegation of authority, policies and procedures that 
cover financial planning and reporting, preparing consolidated accounts, capital 
expenditure, project governance and information security.
the audit committee is responsible for overseeing and monitoring these 
processes, which are designed to ensure that the group complies with 
relevant regulatory reporting and filing provisions. as at the end of the period 
covered by this r eport, the audit committee, with the participation of the chief 
executive and group finance director, evaluated the effectiveness of the design 
and operation of disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that 
information required to be disclosed in financial reports is recorded, processed, 
summarised and reported within specified time periods.
Monitoring Process 
the groups’s approach to monitoring the system of key controls is set out in this 
section of the chief executive’s r eport.
Principal Risks Affecting the Group 
the group has identified the following factors as potential risks to, and 
uncertainties concerning, the successful operation of its business. the group is 
however exposed to a wider range of risks than discussed below but these are 
the principal risks, that have recently been discussed by the board and audit 
committee and are of primary concern.
Area Risk Mitigation
Supply Chain
the group operates internationally so is reliant on 
the successful distribution of goods from when 
they are distributed by the manufacturer to when 
they are sold in the stores.
the group is reliant on manufacturers in 
developing countries as the majority of the group’s 
products are sourced from outside the uk .
the group is therefore subject to the risks associated 
with international trade and transport as well as 
those relating to exposure to different legal and other 
standards. risks including cost increases, energy 
shortages, natural disasters, working practices and 
product safety could all cause significant problems.
the group requires all suppliers to sign up to the group’s code of ethics/supply p olicy which enables 
the group to monitor and benchmark the performance of the supplier. it allows the group to carry out 
inspections of premises to ensure compliance with the group’s codes for continuity and quality of 
supply. this is an on-going process and inspections occur on a random basis.
many risks relating to the supply chain, reliance on non-uk suppliers, and to the reputation of the 
group’s brands are managed and mitigated by the implementation of these policies. strong service 
level agreements and maintaining relationships with all parties involved in the supply chain also 
mitigate these risks.
Key Suppliers
the group is reliant on good relationships with 
its major manufacturers, key brands or brand 
suppliers.
a failure to replace any of its major manufacturers 
or suppliers on commercially reasonable terms could 
have an adverse effect on the group’s business, 
operating profit or overall financial condition. it may 
mean that customers shop elsewhere if stores cannot 
supply the required product.
the group follows policies of forging long term relationships with suppliers and of utilising two leading 
supply chain companies to procure much of the group’s own branded goods. this close relationship 
brings a better understanding of the supplier’s resources enabling the group to react quickly to changes 
in the international supply market. 
Treasury and Financial Risk
the group operates internationally. the majority of 
foreign contracts relating to the sourcing of group 
branded goods are denominated in us dollars 
and the euro, thus leaving exposure to foreign 
exchange risk.
the group has net borrowings, which are 
principally at floating interest rates linked to bank 
base rates or libor .
the group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising 
from various currency exposures and a strengthening 
of the us dollar or a weakening of the pound sterling 
making goods more expensive.
foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial 
transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are 
denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s 
functional currency, as exchange rates move. this 
could significantly reduce profitability.
the group seeks to mitigate the expenses and fX fluctuations by hedging via forward foreign currency 
contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges.
the group also holds assets overseas in local currency, and these assets are revalued in accordance 
with currency movements. this currency risk is not hedged.
the group is cash generative and is now targeting its debt levels to mitigate interest rate risk and 
currently has debt levels of less than 1 x underlying ebitda .
Credit and Liquidity Risk
the group, primarily the brands division, provides 
credit to some of its customers.
f unding and liquidity for the group’s operations 
are provided through bank loans, overdrafts and 
shareholders’ funds. 
the group could have a credit risk if credit evaluations 
were not performed on all customers requiring credit 
over a certain amount.
the group’s objective is to maintain sufficient funding 
and liquidity for its requirements, but the availability 
of adequate cash resources from bank facilities and 
achieving continuity of funding in the current financial 
climate could be a risk to the group in future years.
the group may not be able to purchase  
essential acquisitions.
the group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
the group’s key suppliers also face credit risk and as such the group regularly assesses the viability of 
its suppliers and ensures there are plans to source from alternative businesses should key suppliers fail.
rigorous procedures are in place to mitigate this credit risk. the group has a credit policy in place and 
the exposure to risk is monitored on an on-going basis.
credit evaluations are performed on all customers requiring credit over a certain amount, and 
concentration of credit risk is managed.
investment of cash surplus, borrowings and derivative investments are made through banks and 
companies which have credit ratings and investment criteria approved by the board.
the group mitigates liquidity risk by keeping debt levels low and the current finance facility is held with 
a club of 10 banks, thereby spreading the risk.
the group works with a number of trusted advisors.

The Business Review management & governance financial statements & notes additional information CHIEF ExECUTIvE’S REPORT & BUSINESS REvIEW continued
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES RELATING TO THE GROUP’S BUSINESS continued
Area Risk Mitigation
Investment Risk
the group holds shares in  
publicly-listed companies.
fluctuations in publicly-listed companies’ share prices will have a financial impact on 
the business or results.
the group has chosen to limit further purchases of publicly-listed company 
shares in order to reduce the potential risk to the business, although current 
investments are in known business sectors and are not deemed to be in 
volatile companies.
Succession Planning
the group’s directors and key management 
employees ensure that the current level of 
success is maintained.
illness, injury or resignation of key individuals could change the whole dynamic  
of the group.
succession plans in place where appropriate.
key individuals working ”on the ground” to assess the strengths of  
fellow employees.
r egular appraisals to ensure that employees are developing and training is 
given when necessary.
Market Forces
the sports r etail industry is highly 
competitive and the group currently 
competes at national and local levels with a 
wide variety of retailers of varying sizes who 
may have competitive advantages, and new 
competitors may enter the market.
the competition continues to place pressure on the group’s pricing strategy, margins 
and profitability.
the group has a discount pricing policy to help reduce the risk of increased 
competition in the industry. the group has an incredibly strong property 
portfolio and owns a very large number of key brands. external suppliers often 
consider the group as a very large account.
Pensions
some subsidiaries in the group make 
contributions to certain occupational defined 
benefits pension schemes.
an increase in the schemes’ funding needs or changes to obligations in respect of the 
schemes could have an adverse impact on its business.
although the group is unable to mitigate any change in legislation regarding 
contributions, the schemes are historical and closed to new entrants. the 
group does not intend to enter into any further final salary arrangements 
going forward.
Operational
the group is reliant on the divisional head 
offices and the national distribution centre 
at shirebrook operating without disruption, 
along with the uninterrupted running of the 
group’s fleet of vehicles.
the majority of the group’s revenue is derived 
from the uk .
any disruption to the head offices, the national distribution centre and the fleet 
of vehicles might significantly impact the group’s ability to manage its operations, 
distribute products to its stores and maintain its supply chain.
any long term interruption of the group’s it systems would have a significant impact 
on the group’s operation, particularly in the r etail division.
terrorist attacks, armed conflicts, government actions or adverse weather affecting 
the road networks within the uk could result in a significant reduction in consumer 
confidence, which would in turn have an adverse affect on sales in stores.
the group has a strong business continuity plan that is regularly reviewed 
to address operational risks. the last review and testing of this took place 
during the most recent financial year (fy13).
the board is confident that as far as it is practical, the risks and uncertainties 
that face the group are being monitored and managed and that, where 
required, appropriate action is being taken.
the group constantly monitors the business environment and the nature  
of the business model allows for the group to act swiftly under  
extraordinary circumstances.
the group ensures that health and safety, maintenance and staff training is 
actively monitored and enforced.
Health & Safety
health and safety is key to the group as 
the implementation of policies in this regard 
protects our employees and customers.
f ailure to create and maintain environments which are safe for both employees and 
customers. incidents leading to injuries, trauma or fatalities could result from poor 
compliance with essential health and safety regulations.
health and safety is a priority for the group. incidents are recorded and steps 
are put in place to minimise the risk of these recurring.
as health and safety requirements vary from country to country, we  
ensure that each company in the relevant countries are fully trained in the 
standards required.
Legal
the group’s trade marks, patents, designs 
and other intellectual property rights are 
central to the value of the group’s brands.
the group believes that its licensees, suppliers, agents and distributors are in 
material compliance with employment, environmental and other laws. the violation, 
or allegations of a violation, of such laws or regulations, by any of the group’s 
licensees, suppliers, agents or distributors, could lead to adverse publicity and a 
decline in public demand for the group’s products, or require the group to incur 
expenditure or make changes to its supply chain and other business arrangements to 
ensure compliance.
the group may need to resort to litigation in the future to enforce its intellectual 
property rights and any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion  
of resources.
third parties may try to challenge the ownership or counterfeit the group’s  
intellectual property.
the group has an in-house specialist trade mark and license legal 
department that administers all registrations and regulations. this in-house 
expertise is vital in mitigating any or all such issues.
Sales
the group’s retail businesses are subject 
to seasonal peaks. the incidence and 
participation in major sporting events  
will have a particular impact on the uk  
r etail business.
prolonged unseasonal weather conditions or temporary severe weather during peak 
trading seasons could have a material adverse effect on the group’s businesses. the 
group are dependent upon the store portfolio and consumers’ spending habits.
although unable to mitigate environmental conditions the group are able to 
influence the retail portfolio and therefore constantly monitor development  
of stores and the group’s aim to increase the square footage through 
viable new retail space. by monitoring stock levels correctly through sales 
forecasting the group can manage the peaks in demand and trading profiles 
can be predicted.
Sports Direct plc Annual Report 2013
30  Area Risk Mitigation
Consumer
the group’s success and sales are 
dependent, in part, on the strength and 
reputation of the brands it sells, and are 
subject to consumers’ perceptions of the 
group and of its products, which can fall  
out of favour.
adverse publicity concerning any of the group’s brands, manufacturers or  
suppliers could lead to substantial erosion in the reputation of, or value associated 
with the group. 
the dedicated legal department monitors usage of the group’s own brands to 
ensure they are used in the correct manner.
specific individuals in the media are chosen to promote brands.  
the group carefully selects individuals who will fit with the products and  
the target market.
Environmental
the group is subject to the negative effects 
that environmental disasters can have on the 
business environment.
environmental disasters have highlighted how it is impossible to predict how an 
environmental occurrence will affect businesses.
the group constantly updates systems to mitigate any delay or loss of goods 
in transit or the absence of any employee or large numbers of employees that 
may or may not be altered by acts of nature.
CONTRACTS ESSENTIAL TO THE BUSINESS OF THE GROUP
the group has long-established relationships with nike and adidas, the major 
suppliers of third-party branded sporting goods, particularly footwear, and 
considers that continued supplies from these companies are critical to the 
business of the group.
ENvIRONMENTAL MATTERS 
the corporate r esponsibility r eport is on pages 52 to 55 and a review of 
the assessment of the group’s impact on the environment is included in the 
corporate r esponsibility r eport on pages 53 and 54.
RESEARCH AND DEvELOPMENT
the group’s success depends on the strength of the group brands and, to a 
lesser extent, the licensed-in brands. the group’s efforts to continually develop 
or obtain brands in a timely manner or at all may be unsuccessful. 
OUTLOOK
the start of the fy14 has already been busy with the acquisition of majority 
stakes in two leading european sporting goods retailers in austria and in  
the baltic region. this means that the group is now active in 19 countries across 
europe. while management is focused on the successful integration  
of these businesses, we also expect to see more opportunities to grow the 
group internationally.
the group has witnessed a strong start to the year with trading ahead of 
management’s expectations. this performance is attributable to a number of 
factors including the investment in gross margin made last year, increased 
operating efficiencies and the exceptional quality and unbeatable value sports 
direct continues to offer to its customers. however, recent out-performance 
versus management expectations may not continue for the full year. fy14 is a 
non-tournament year, which will make fy13 a tough comparator following the 
uefa european championships and the london olympics. 
with this performance in mind, we remain focused and driven to achieve our 
internal stretch underlying ebitda target of £310m (before the charge for the 
2011 employee and executive bonus share schemes).

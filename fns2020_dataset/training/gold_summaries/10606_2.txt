and the month of March has seen an upturn in bookings compared to last year. It is too early to say

transactional	website	launched	in	November	2013	is	recording	site	traffic	above	expectations.		
commenting on the results and outlook, Brian Brick, chief executive Officer, said:
“We	enter	the	new	financial	year	with	a	strong	balance	sheet	and	a	commitment	to	a	significantly	
increased dividend. The ongoing cash generation of the business will support the continued investment in 
store	refits	and	develop	our	multi-channel	capability.	2014	will	see	an	increase	in	marketing	to	support	the	
opportunities	identified	in	the	findings	of	the	customer	insight	project,	conducted	in	2013.	We	will	adopt	
“Moss Bros” as the master brand and will launch Moss branded sub brands in Autumn 2014.
The business is on track to achieve market expectations in 2014/15.”

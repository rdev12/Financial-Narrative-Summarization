Camellia Plc is an international Group – a global family of diverse companies with a 128-year heritage employing
approximately 76,000 people worldwide. Our operating divisions include Agriculture, Banking and Financial
Services, Engineering, Food Service and Investments. From the start, Camellia’s ethos has been based on the
highest moral and professional integrity, and a commitment to doing the right thing – ethically and commercially,
globally and locally. Profits are our lifeblood but not our soul.
Our business is built on two fundamental principles:
� Long-termism. We see ourselves as custodians, holding our businesses in trust for future generations. We
believe we have a responsibility to ensure the stability, security and continuity of all our businesses, so they can
be passed on to the next generation as enduring operations. We recognise that people and businesses take time
to establish and grow to their full potential and we are happy to wait for that to happen. We are deeply
committed to improving the long-term stability and well-being of our businesses, the communities and the
environments in which we are involved.
� Sustainability. We are committed not only to the ultimate welfare of our employees but also to the
communities in which they live. We believe our businesses can and should grow with respect and care for the
environment rather than at the cost of it. We proactively invest in ensuring that the environments where we do
business are continually protected and improved, and seek to minimise any damage our activities may cause.
Our business is made up of five divisions:

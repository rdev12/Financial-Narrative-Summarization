Parkdean Holidays plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2004
Chairman’s Statement
Graham Wilson
Chairman
The financial year ending 31 October
2004 marked Parkdean Holidays’ 
fifth anniversary and the Group’s third
Annual Report as a public company.
During the year under review Parkdean
has continued to successfully deliver
on its key strategic objectives resulting
in increased shareholder returns, 
both in terms of capital growth and
dividend payments.
The Group continues to invest in the
holiday parks under its stewardship and
to improve their financial performance
whilst acquiring additional holiday parks
and maintaining an appropriate balance
of personnel and systems resources
required for the management of an
expanding portfolio of parks. The Board 
is also mindful of its responsibility to
shareholders to maintain a satisfactory
financial balance between the use of
bank debt and shareholders’ equity.
Results
Group turnover increased from £51.91 m
in 2003 to £60.38m in 2004. Turnover
from acquisitions made during 2004
accounted for £3.23m of this increase,
primarily from Southerness. Turnover at
the 14 parks owned for the whole year
increased by 10.1% to £57 .15m.
Group operating profit for 2004
increased to £12.87m including £0.66m
from acquisitions. Operating profit from
the 14 parks owned for the whole year
increased from £12.02m in 2003 to
£12.21m in 2004. This increase in
operating profit arises despite winter
costs for White Acres and Sea Acres
impacting for the first time in 2004 – 
both parks were acquired in May 2003 
– and incremental costs for the new
reservations and administration centre 
in Newcastle upon Tyne.
The increase in 2004 pre-tax profit 
of £0.07m to £9.05m understates the
significant improvement in performance 
in the 14 parks owned for all of 2004
where like-for-like operating profit 
grew by 10.2% as described in the
Financial Review.
Earnings per share and dividends
Basic earnings per share amounted to
15.25p; fully diluted earnings per share
amounted to 14.70p.
An interim dividend of 2.20p per share
(2003: 2.00p) was paid to shareholders
on 22 September 2004. The Directors
are recommending a final dividend of
3.30p per share on all ordinary shares in
issue to shareholders on the register at 
4 March 2005, payable on 31 March 2005.
The total dividend of 5.5p per share is a
10% increase over 2003 and is covered
2.4 times.
Acquisitions and development
The Group began the year under review
with 14 parks covering 871 acres with 
a total of 6,546 pitches.
During the year £9.96m was invested 
in the existing estate, continuing our 
hire fleet improvement programme and
developing new pitches and recreational
and leisure facilities as well as investment
in IT systems and hardware.
Southerness Holiday Village was
acquired for £5.30m in March and 
Cherry Tree, Warmwell, Torquay, Pendine
Sands and Wemyss Bay holiday parks
were bought for £41.75m immediately
prior to the year-end.  03
At 31 October 2004 the estate of 20
parks covered 1,315 acres with a total 
of 9,189 pitches. 
The Group is beginning 2005 with total
pitch numbers 40% higher than 2004.
There are correspondingly 40% more 
hire fleet, 63% more private pitches 
and 10% less touring pitches. Clearly,
operating profit for 2005 will be
significantly enhanced by this expansion
in the estate.
Capital resources 
The acquisitions referred to above 
have been substantially funded by the
draw-down of the acquisition facility 
of £32.90m available to the Group. 
In addition the Company successfully
placed 10.35m new ordinary shares 
at £2.00 each to raise £19.83m net 
of expenses, on 20 October 2004.
The directors are currently well
advanced in discussions with a
syndicate of banks to put in place 
a new agreement providing increased
debt facilities to the Group. 
People
The directors continue to strengthen 
the management team as and when
appropriate. The directors wish to record
their appreciation of the efforts of all 
our staff in the achievement of a good 
set of results in 2004 and in the wider
development of the Group.
Outlook
Parkdean Holidays’ 2005 brochure was
launched in late November 2004 with all
20 parks featured. The directors intend 
to provide shareholders with an update
on holiday sales at the Annual General
Meeting on 4 March 2005.
The primary task for 2005 is to ensure
the satisfactory performance of the
existing portfolio of 20 parks, with 
special emphasis on the five new parks
integrated into the Group since late
October 2004. The directors will
continue to seek appropriately priced
acquisitions whilst simultaneously
pursuing organic growth opportunities 
to further enhance shareholder value.

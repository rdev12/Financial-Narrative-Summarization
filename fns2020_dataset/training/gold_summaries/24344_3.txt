 GLOBALWORTH TOWER
BUCHAREST’S LANDMARK 
OFFICE TOWER
STRATEGY IN ACTION 
The idea for the development of Globalworth Tower, was conceived at the 
same time as when Globalworth (the Company) was in the process of being 
established.
The Idea
We believed that the city was missing a new modern, high-rise landmark, Class “A” 
office building which would demonstrate the same characteristics found in Western 
Europe. Mainly a multi-floor, high-rise, energy-efficient, Class “A” office property, 
with a large floor plate and a high utilisation coefficient, that would be easily 
accessible by both public and private transportation. 
We believed that this product would be very attractive to large multinational tenants 
operating in Romania, who were looking to replicate international trends and 
practices for their activities in the country. At the same time, offering a high quality 
work space, which is easily accessible to employees, further incentivises 
performance and work ethic.
A building demonstrating all the aforementioned characteristics did not exist in 
Bucharest and as such we decided to develop it ourselves as Globalworth!
The Implementation
Key in every real estate investment is the location of the property to be acquired / 
development and when the site on 201 Barbu Vacarescu Street became available we 
acted quickly to secure it. The property displays all the key characteristics we were 
looking for:
 ¡ Accessibility: located next to the metro station (max 5min walk to all other public 
transport)
 ¡ Visibility: the site is located at the corner of three main road arteries
 ¡ Shape: the site has a rectangle shape
 ¡ Building coefficient: allowing the development of a c.54,700sqm GLA above 
ground
 ¡ Height coefficient: allowing the development of a 120 meter tower
As we secured the site to be developed, we initiated the design and permitting 
process for the project. Considering the overall size of the development, we were 
looking to have mainly restaurants and commercial uses on the ground floor and 
offer premium Class “A” office space on all other floors above ground.
The restaurants and coffee shops, together with the development of the  
Mega Image concept store offer multiple options for the people working at 
Globalworth Tower, and allow them to socialise, have business meetings and find 
alternative culinary options.
On the 26 floors above ground, we offer premium Class “A” office space, with above 
average height (2.85m) and great views to our tenants.

Area & Access
Globalworth Tower is centrally located in one of Bucharest’s 
most “dynamic” business hubs to the north of the city. The 
northern part of the city, due to its excellent infrastructure, 
close proximity to the airport and availability of land plots 
has attracted significant investment by both landlords and 
(mainly international) occupiers in recent time, and has 
evolved to become the New CBD of Bucharest.
The property is strategically positioned at the entrance of 
the new CBD and enjoys a direct opening to three main 
streets (Barbu Vacarescu Street, Pipera Road and Calea 
Floreasca Road), which in conjunction with its great height 
(c.120m), results in a high level of visibility. 
Globalworth Tower is easily accessible by public transport 
as the Aurel Vlaicu Square subway station, three bus stops 
and two tram stations are located within a 5 minutes’ walk 
from the property. In addition Globalworth Tower is also 
accessible by car from the three aforementioned streets, 
namely Barbu Vacarescu Street, Pipera Road and Calea 
Floreasca Road.

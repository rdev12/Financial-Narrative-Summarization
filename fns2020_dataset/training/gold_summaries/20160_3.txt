 Chairman’ s statement
“This has been an exceptional year for 3i. The Group 
has delivered a high return on shareholders’ funds
and a strong cash flow and, most importantly of all, 
has taken important steps to develop the business 
for the longer term.”

3i has had another year of strong financial
performance. A number of our strategic
initiatives have contributed to our growth
and it has been a very productive period for
business development. The Group’s total
return of £1,075 million for the year to 
31 March 2007 represented 26.8% on
opening shareholders’ funds. 
Realisations were again very strong. 
The quality of our portfolio, favourable
merger and acquisitions markets and the 
skill of our teams around the world have
delivered realisation proceeds of 
£2,438 million, with an uplift in value 
on sale of 52%. 
3i’s strategic position in both high growth 
and more mature markets also enabled the
Group to increase investment by 42% to
£1,576 million. Growth was especially 
strong in Asia, which accounted for 16% 
of investment in the year.
During the year the Buyouts business raised
its latest 15 billion mid-market buyout 
fund, Eurofund V, and we extended our
international reach with new Growth Capital
teams in Beijing and New York. We also
established two new business lines, with the
£700 million launch of 3i Infrastructure
Limited on the London Stock Exchange, and
the establishment of our “Quoted Private
Equity” team. 
Progress on so many fronts would not, 
of course, have been possible without the
commitment and experience of many 
people to whom I offer my thanks: our staff
world-wide; the management teams and
advisers of our portfolio companies; and
above all our Chief Executive Philip Y ea and
his Management Committee. 
The strength of the Group’s cash flow 
has meant that we have been able not only
to grow investment levels and invest 
in a number of strategic initiatives but 
also to return capital to shareholders.
Following approval at our Extraordinary
General Meeting (“EGM”) last year, 
£700 million has been returned to our
shareholders. The Group also bought back
£74 million of ordinary shares during the
year. The Board has announced its intention
to return a further £800 million to
shareholders by way of a bonus issue of listed
B shares. Resolutions relating to the return of
capital proposals will be put to shareholders
at another EGM, which is currently expected 
to take place in July.
The Board is recommending a final ordinary
dividend of 10.3p, making a total ordinary
dividend for the year of 16.1p, up 5.9% on 
last year. 
I was delighted to welcome Robert Swannell
as a non-executive Director to the Board in
September 2006. Robert is Vice Chairman of
Citigroup Europe and a member of Citigroup’s
Global Investment Banking Committee, 
in addition to being a non-executive Director
of British Land Company plc. He has
extensive experience of international financial
services and wide experience of business. 
Danny Rosenkranz, who has been a 
non-executive Director of the Group since
2000, retires from the Board at the AGM 
in July. I would like to thank him for the
considerable contribution he has made to 
the Board during a very important period for
3i and especially for his work as Chairman of
the Remuneration Committee. 
As private equity has grown as an asset 
class for investors, so it has attracted more
attention from political and business
commentators. Our track record as a 
FTSE 100 company since 1994, and our
pioneering approach to governance and
corporate responsibility issues in the industry,
stand 3i in good stead as the debate about
responsibility and transparency in the 
industry develops. 
As a member of Sir David Walker’s working
group for the British Venture Capital
Association I am delighted to be involved 
in taking this debate to the next stage.
Meanwhile, in this report you will see that we
have provided further details on our largest
investments and realisations in the year. 
At 3i, we are proud of our record of 
growing businesses. We have always placed
considerable emphasis on the quality of our
relationships with investee companies, and on
corporate responsibility, as endorsed by our
high ranking in the Dow Jones Sustainability
Index for 2007. I would like to congratulate
our Corporate Responsibility Committee, led
by the Company Secretary, T ony Brierley, 
on winning this year’s Investor Relations
Society Best Practice Award for the
Corporate responsibility section of our 
2006 Annual report.
In summary, this has been an exceptional
year for 3i. The Group has delivered a high
return on shareholders’ funds and a strong
cash flow and, most importantly of all, 
has taken important steps to develop the
business for the longer term.

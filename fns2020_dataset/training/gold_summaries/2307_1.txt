Booker Group plc
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2008
Booker has improved considerably in 
the past couple of years.  In September 
2005 net debt was £361m, sales were 
dropping at 6%, proﬁ ts had slumped 
and our pension liability was £125m.  
Supplier and customer conﬁ dence in 
the business was very low.  In November 
2005 the senior management team 
was changed.  At that time we outlined 
a three phase Recovery Plan which 
explained how we would ‘Focus’ the 
business, then ‘Drive’ it and then start to 
‘Broaden’ Booker.  The plan is working.  
Today our net debt is £47.2m, sales 
are up 2.3%, operating proﬁ t is up 29% 
and our pension is in surplus.  Despite 
these improvements we still have a lot 
to do to fulﬁ l our ambition of becoming 
the UK’s best and biggest supplier to 
small business.
FOCUS
(commenced November 2005) 
Although most of our ‘Focus’ activity 
was completed between November 
2005 and March 2006, we continue 
to improve business efﬁ ciency.  
Colleagues in branches, the distribution 
centres and the centre are improving 
cash and cost efﬁ ciency.  For example, 
we are moving more products ‘by the 
pallet’ so that there is less wasted 
effort in taking the sales.  Throughout 
the business we are seeking to ‘stop, 
simplify and standardise’ work so that 
we enhance customer service whilst 
improving efﬁ ciency.  As a result of a 
tight operational management our net 
debt in 2007/08 was cut by £29.3m.
DRIVE
(commenced April 2006)
We now survey over 40,000 customers 
per annum to see how each branch 
and product category is performing.  
Most branches and categories made 
signiﬁ cant progress during the year 
which reﬂ ects our efforts to improve 
choice, price and service:
Choice Up
In May 2007 we introduced ‘First � 
for Pubs’ range.  We now sell over 
2,000 kegs of beer per week.
In July 2007 we launched � 
Euro Shopper, a range of 33 
lines which allow the independent 
retailer to beneﬁ t from the growth 
of discount retailing.  Euro Shopper 
sales are now over £300k per 
week.  Over 18,500 customers 
purchase Euro Shopper every 
week and the consumer response 
has been excellent.  Euro Shopper 
complements Booker Basics, our 
entry price range for caterers which 
sells over £400k per week.
In November 2007 we launched � 
price marked packs of fruit and 
vegetables for retailers.  We also 
introduced Butcher’s Market – a 
range of price marked fresh meats 
which are selling very well.
 Prices Down
In March 2007 we introduced � 
‘cheaper by the case’ deals on 
33 lines.
In April 2007 we launched ‘every � 
day essentials’, very competitive 
pricing on milk, bread and other 
essentials.
In May 2007 we offered ‘season � 
long’ pricing for caterers, where prices 
were ﬁ xed for the entire season.
During the year we have seen � 
product cost inﬂ ation in several 
product sectors including cooking 
oil, rice, pasta and bread.  Despite 
this challenge our prices have 
remained competitive.

Better Service
In October 2007 we extended � 
branch opening hours.
In January 2008 we launched free � 
delivery and removed charges 
for handling credit and debit cards.
All branch staff have been trained � 
on PRIDE.  How we can improve 
the Parking, Reception, Internal, 
Delivery and Exit experience for 
customers.
We now have 2,106 customers trading 
as Premier.  Premier won several 
awards for its excellent standards 
and was Symbol Group of the Year 
in 2006.  In 2008 we will improve 
the scale and execution of Premier in 
partnership with the Premier retailers.
The combination of improved choice, 
price and service has enhanced overall 
customer satisfaction.  Improved 
customer satisfaction has allowed 
Booker to increase sales in 2007/08 
despite the cooling in the economy and 
the ban on smoking in public places.
BROADEN
(commenced April 2007)
We are now seeking to ‘Broaden’ 
Booker.  To achieve this we are:
Improving the cash and � 
carry experience
In January 2006 we converted our 
ﬁ rst ‘Extra’ branch.  This has now 
been rolled out to 34 of the 172 
branches.  The key features are a 
lighter, brighter branch environment, 
an improved layout, signage and 
ranges. Our Stoke branch is typical 
of the new format (see below).
The ‘Extra’ format is a big move 
forward.  Caterers, retailers and 
small business customers much 
prefer the environment and the 
payback on reformatting the branch 
is less than 12 months.
Internet � 
For the last 30 years multiple 
retailers and caterers have beneﬁ ted 
from their superior use of technology.  
We believe that the internet will 
help transform the outlook for small 
business. In June 2007 we 
launched the improved booker.

on the site have increased from 
£44m per annum last year to 
£109m (includes £17m Blueheath) 
per annum this year.  However, this 
is just the start.  Over the next year 
customers will have internet over 
their mobile phones, community 
sites and a lot more.
 Booker Direct � 
Booker distributes £500m of 
products from our branches to 
the customer’s premises.  We 
recognised the opportunity to 
improve this service and identiﬁ ed 
Blueheath Holdings Plc as having 
technology and expertise that would 
accelerate this.  In May 2007 we 
announced the reverse take-over 
of Blueheath.  We have achieved 
the cash and cost beneﬁ ts outlined 
last Summer.  We have moved 
Blueheath’s biggest customer to 
the Booker Hatﬁ eld distribution 
centre.  We have started to win 
new business such as Rippleglen, a 
chain of convenience stores in the 
Midlands.  Booker will now increase 
deliveries from regional distribution 
centres and branches to caterers 
and retailers.
The Focus, Drive, Broaden plan 
is facilitated by improving staff 
development and by improving their 
sustainability of the business:
 People � 
The Group is an equal opportunities  -
employer.
Branch colleagues have been  -
trained in PRIDE (Parking, Reception, 
Internal, Delivery, and Exit).  This 
programme was designed by 
branch colleagues to help improve 
customer service.  
The role of the branch General  -
Manager has been clearly deﬁ ned 
to focus on the customer and 
cash proﬁ t.
In 2007 the majority of colleagues  -
received a bonus.  The ﬁ rst time 
this has happened since 2000.
We updated our health and safety  -
standards and in February 2008 
held a ‘Health and Safety Week’ 
to increase awareness.  We are 
committed to making Booker a 
better and safer place to work.
Sustainability � 
Booker has saved over 10,000  -
tonnes of CO
2
 (10% of our total 
carbon ‘footprint’) in the past year 
due to driving less food miles, 
using less electricity and improved 
product packaging.
The Group fulﬁ ls its duty to minimise  -
adverse environmental impacts by 
ensuring efﬁ cient use of materials and 
energy, recycling wherever possible, 
minimising waste and ensuring 
compliance with relevant legislation.
We have pioneered a supplier  -
distribution carbon model which is 
starting to optimise the distribution 
efﬁ ciency for suppliers and 
ourselves.
Of our private label sales 79% of 
packaging can be recycled, which 
is better than many of the multiple 
retailers.
In summary, it has been a year of 
steady delivery for Booker.  Customer 
satisfaction has improved, sales have  
increased, operating proﬁ ts are up 
29%, net debt is down 38% and we 
integrated Blueheath.  We made good 
progress, but there is a lot more to do.

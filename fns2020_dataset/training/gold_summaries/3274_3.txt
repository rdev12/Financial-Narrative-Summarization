Chairman’ s Statement
At the half year stage, we were pleased to announce that 
Chamberlin had returned to profitability. We expected 
revenues and profits in the second half of the financial 
year to continue to build and this was the case, with 
operating profit in the second half at £682,000 against 
£222,000 in the first half, a 305% increase. For the year as a 
whole the Group delivered an underlying profit before tax 
of £804,000 (2010: underlying loss of £1,028,000). This is 
slightly ahead of market forecasts, which were upgraded in 
November 2010, and represents a turnaround of over 
£1.8m over the prior year.
Results
Demand recovered throughout the year, with revenues for the year ended 
31 March 2011 rising to £39.8m (2010: £28.5m), a 40% improvement. 
Increased activity in our established customer base underpinned this 
recovery but I am encouraged to note that new business made a strong 
contribution, especially in the second half of the year, leaving Chamberlin 
well placed for the current financial year and beyond.
The rise in gross profit margins of 3.0 percentage points to 18.7% from 
15.7% is noteworthy and the Group delivered an underlying operating 
profit of £904,000 against an operating loss of £895,000 in the prior year. 
The underlying profit before tax was £804,000 (2010: underlying loss 
before tax of £1,028,000) and underlying earnings per share were 6.7p 
(2010: underlying loss per share of 12.8p).
The statutory results show operating profit of £508,000 (2010: loss of 
£1,049,000), statutory profit before tax of £333,000 (2010: loss before tax 
of £1,421,000) and statutory earnings per share of 1.3p (2010: loss per 
share of 16.4p).
The business continues to remain very cash generative. Chamberlin 
generated net cash from operations throughout the downturn and 
growing profitability in the second half year has accentuated this trend. 
Cash from operations was £1.41m in the second half, bringing the total 
cash generated from operations for the year to £1.79m (2010: £0.50m). As 
a result, during the year we reduced net borrowing by over £0.5m and at 
31 March 2011, net debt stood at £2.88m (2010: £3.45m) the lowest 
point since March 2008. We remain well financed, with an overdraft 
facility of £5.0m with HSBC, which has recently been renewed with a 
reduced interest rate.
Dividend
In view of the Group’s return to profitability and our belief that we will 
see Chamberlin’s performance continue to strengthen, I am very pleased 
to announce that the Board proposes to return to the payment of 
dividends. The Directors are recommending the payment of a final 
dividend of 1.0p per share, to be paid on 14 July 2011 to shareholders on 
the register at 1 July 2011.
In the future our dividend policy will be progressive and we will seek to 
pay regular dividends at a level covered adequately by earnings.
“We expect Chamberlin to continue to make good progress over the new financial 
year and, with demand for our products linked to global engineering activity, we see 
powerful long term trends favouring our business. We view prospects for the year 
very positively.”

Business performance and growth strategy
It was very pleasing to see business volumes in our three foundries 
recover strongly over the course of the year. We closed the year with our 
light castings foundry at Walsall operating at 100% of pre-recession 
volumes and our heavy castings foundry at Scunthorpe exceeding 
pre-recession levels. Our medium castings operation at Leicester was at 
85% of pre-recession production but is continuing to recover.
Looking forward, we see very good growth opportunities across all our 
foundries and our engineering operations, Exidor and Petrel, which 
contribute about 20% of Group sales are also well positioned.
With return to growth firmly established and Chamberlin in good 
operational shape we are, as I noted in my previous statement, again 
looking at the expansion of the Group. In February 2011 we acquired 
certain assets from the administrators of Jebron Ltd, a door closer 
manufacturer. This is an excellent fit with Exidor, extending the product 
offering, and it should add over £1.0m of profitable sales on an 
annualised basis.
As we look for acquisitions, we are considering businesses which meet 
our theme ‘difficult things done well’ and which will complement our 
existing operations. Potential targets include foundry operations which 
add to the capabilities already in the Group.
The Board
I have been very pleased to lead the Board as Chairman since 2004, 
after joining as a Non-Executive Director in 2003. Having overseen 
Chamberlin through both a modernisation programme and a severe 
recession, and now with the Company restored to profitability and 
dividend payments and entering a new phase of development, I have 
decided that it is an appropriate time for me to consider retiring from the 
Board. I intend to do this in due course once the Board’s succession 
planning has been finalised.
Outlook
The financial year to the end of March 2011 marked a turning point for 
Chamberlin, with the Company returning to profit and recommencing 
the payment of dividends. Chamberlin has come through recession very 
robustly, helped by the modernisation and investment programme 
completed prior to recession. We have continued to seek process 
improvements during the downturn and also maintained our skill base 
and output capability. These factors stand us in good stead as volume 
recovery continues. In addition, Chamberlin’s very high level of technical 
skills means that we are very well positioned in our target markets.
We expect Chamberlin to continue to make good progress over the new 
financial year and, with demand for our products linked to global 
engineering activity, we see powerful long term trends favouring our 
business. We view prospects for the year very positively.

“Charter’s results for 2010 were an 
improvement over 2009, with revenue, 
adjusted operating proﬁt and adjusted 
earnings per share all increasing.  
These results were achieved against  
an economic backdrop that was better 
than that experienced in 2009, but 
which remained varied with some 
regions and end-user segments 
continuing to be weak.
Despite the continuing economic 
uncertainties in Europe, we expect 
further progress in 2011 as a result  
of the ongoing investment and 
improvements made in both 
businesses, with a faster pace  
in emerging markets.”

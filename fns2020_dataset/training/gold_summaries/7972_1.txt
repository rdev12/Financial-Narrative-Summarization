Group Chief Executive’s review
André Lacroix
Group Chief Executive
Inchcape is a leading independent,
international automotive distributor and
retailer,with scale operations in Australia,
Belgium,Greece,Hong Kong,Russia,
Singapore and the UK as well as operations
in 19 other markets.We represent some of
the world’s leading automotive brands with
whom we have long-standing relationships.
During 2008,the car industry faced
unprecedented challenges as the economic
downturn spread rapidly across the world.
While Inchcape is not immune to the
downturn,I believe we are well placed to
ride it out successfully,based on the intrinsic
strengths of our business together with the
prudent and decisive actions we are taking,
so that we will be well positioned to capitalise
on market recovery.
We have more than 160 years of successful
international trade experience based on
a pioneering spirit that has seen us at the
forefront of every industry in which we have
participated.Our focus today is squarely
on the car market where we have been
an industry leading retailer and distributor
for many years.We continue to owe this
pre-eminence to two fundamental factors:
the resilience of our business model,and
the clarity of our vision and strategy.
In addition,we have an exceptional senior
team with an in-depth knowledge of the
automotive industry and local markets and
who share a collective record of decisive,
successful management in the face of
economic upheaval.
We are a proven
industry leader,
solidly positioned
for market recovery. 7

A diversiﬁed and resilient business model
We believe our business model has a number
of key strengths including a diversity that
ensures resilience and provides a balanced
portfolio of income streams.
First,we have a broad geographic spread
with scale positions and a presence across
both mature and emerging markets.We
beneﬁt from a decentralised organisational
model which enables us to stay close to
changes in the marketplace and react
quickly to ﬂex our operational focus.We
enjoy a leading market share in many
markets thanks to our ﬁrst-hand experience
and hard-won knowledge of different buying
preferences and our relentless focus on
superior customer service.
Second,we have long-standing relationships
with strong brand partners who outperform
the market,giving us access to a pipeline
of attractive new models.Our brand strategy
is market speciﬁc,enabling us to ﬁt the right
brand with the right market to pursue our
core purpose of creating the ultimate
customer experience for our brand partners,
whilst aiming to maximise market share.
Third,we have a multi-channel structure,in
which our Distribution businesses – where we
represent every aspect of a brand partner’s
presence in a speciﬁc national market –
have historically delivered stable,strong cash
generation and our Retail businesses provide
access to diversiﬁed and resilient sources of
revenue through,for example,aftersales
service and parts.
Inchcape’s history of outperformance is due
to the key strengths of our business model
and the clarity of our vision and strategy.
These diversiﬁed income streams (our value
drivers) give us both the growth opportunities
that drive our business forward (new and used
car sales,third-party ﬁnance and insurance
products) and defensive income (aftersales
service and parts) that becomes increasingly
important in times of economic difﬁculty.
Aftersales represents approximately 50% of
our gross margin.This is an area on which
we are focusing greater resources than
ever before as an integral component of
our Customer 1st strategy,emphasising the
quality and value beneﬁts for car-owners
in staying with their franchise retailer after
the expiry of their warranty period.
It is a signiﬁcant area of opportunity for
us as even during times of declining new
vehicle sales,the total population of cars
on the road (the car parc) continues to
grow and more motorists concentrate on
maintaining rather than replacing their
existing vehicle.
Our focus on maximising the economic
contribution of all our value drivers by
constantly driving new efﬁciencies has
enabled us historically to deliver strong
margins.We seek to continue to improve our
performance throughout 2009,when difﬁcult
market conditions mean that maximising
returns will be particularly important.
A clear vision and strategy
Meeting our vision of being the industry’s
most customer-centric retailer anywhere in
the world is fundamental to the success of
our business model.
To be the world’ s
most customer-
centric automotive
retail group
A clear vision and strategy
Our goal of creating and delivering the
ultimate customer experience is a key
differentiator for Inchcape in our industry
and provides the basis of our long-standing
relationships with many of the world’s
leading motor manufacturers.Our passion
for superior customer service reﬂects directly
on the reputation of our brand partners,
making this a compelling reason for them to
select Inchcape as their partner of choice.
This Customer 1st approach is central to our
business and drives decisions taken at every
level of the organisation.Understanding the
customer’s view of our performance is vital
and we continue to invest strongly in
mystery shopper and customer feedback
programmes and leading technologies
to support our activities.These combine to
give us a constant view of our performance
from the customer’s perspective and help
us identify opportunities the moment
they emerge.
The combination of our unique business
model and our differentiating customer
focus has underpinned Inchcape’s success
for many years.Today,it is enabling us to
outperform our competitors in the most
difﬁcult trading conditions to affect our
industry for more than a generation.

Our ﬁve key priorities
Managing the downturn
We have responded swiftly to the economic
downturn with decisive management action
to make our business even sharper,more
effective and more efﬁcient.We believe
this will help us both minimise the negative
impact from the current downturn and
prepare us to emerge stronger when
the market recovers.We have narrowed
our management focus to the ﬁve basics
of our business,our‘ﬁve key priorities’:
growing market share whilst protecting
margins; growing aftersales; reducing costs;
managing working capital; and reducing
uncommitted capital expenditure.
Focusing on these priorities now,means
that we will be well-placed to take
advantage of the growth opportunities
that come with recovery.
Market share growth
Growing market share whilst protecting
margins in our Retail businesses springs
directly from our Customer 1st strategy,with a
focus on trafﬁc conversion through rigorous,
disciplined sales processes and outstanding
levels of customer service.Further,in today’s
market,our ability to help customers gain
access to the ﬁnance credit they need to
buy a car is a clear advantage.In our
Distribution businesses we will grow our
market share through disciplined marketing
effectiveness,taking full advantage of our
brand partners’new product launches and
offering strong value for money propositions
to our customers.
Aftersales growth
Growing our aftersales business will come
from focused service and parts marketing,
a strong emphasis on retaining customers
and providing outstanding levels of customer
service through,for example,our‘Vehicle
Health Check’.The key for us today is to
recognise and respond to every transaction
as an opportunity to build a long-term
customer relationship that delivers value
to both parties.This is central to our
Customer 1st strategy.
Further,in our aftersales workshops,we
continue to apply ourselves to driving
productivity enhancement and therefore
gross margin.
Cost reduction
In terms of cost saving,we already have
a major restructuring programme under
way that will deliver an annualised beneﬁt
of approximately £58m,based on 2009
exchange rates.This includes a 12%
reduction of our global workforce,tight new
restrictions on travel and a retail site and
ofﬁce rationalisation which by the ﬁrst half
of 2009 will have resulted in the closure of
24 less proﬁtable sites,comprising 16 retail
centres,one used car centre and one
PDI centre in the UK,two retail centres in
Greece and four in the Baltics.The Group
has implemented a general hiring freeze
and a policy of no salary increases in 2009
or management bonuses for 2008.
Additionally,we are negotiating harder
than ever before on everything we spend
and successfully taking advantage of
reduced advertising media costs.
Working capital management
Managing our working capital as efﬁciently
as possible is a top priority right across the
business.Unsold stock on forecourts is a
major expense for any motor retailer and
we have set stock reduction targets across
the Group.We have the support of our
brand partners to match our inventory
levels to the new market demand,which
is successfully helping us to contain our
working capital levels.
Capital expenditure reduction
Our forward capital expenditure programme
is largely driven by the agreements we have
in place with our brand partners,some of
which commit us to building new retail
centres in an agreed expansion timetable.
The excellent relationships we have with
our brand partners however,mean we
have been able to defer some projects.
In addition,we are slowing some aspects
of the implementation of our new SAP
system across the Group,while streamlining
its adoption in our Retail business to beneﬁt
as rapidly as possible from its main
commercial advantages.

Confident
We are planning for the future,so that when
the recovery comes we will be uniquely
positioned to take advantage of the growth
opportunities and emerge stronger.
Solidly positioned for market recovery
We are conﬁdent that taking these
proactive steps now will prepare us for the
best possible performance once the market
recovers when,we believe,opportunities
will be signiﬁcant.We see a number of
structural and economic factors that will
help shape the future of our industry.
It is likely that,when it comes,recovery will
take place faster in the emerging markets,
where the current low levels of car ownership
means that there is greater potential for
the demand for new and used vehicles to
increase.We will be able to use our existing
presence in those emerging markets to
full advantage.
However,there will be signiﬁcant opportunities
in the mature markets too,stemming from the
need for vehicle replacement as the car parc
ages,combined with technological innovation
which will both stimulate demand and drive
down the cost of ownership.
Industry consolidation means that we
will face a reduced number of competitors
in some of our markets,so that when the
recovery comes it is likely that we will be
growing from a position of higher market
share,providing the opportunity for improved
throughput and economic performance of
our retail centres.
Further,we believe vehicle manufacturers will
address the current oversupply of vehicles
by rationalising their production to create
a better balance between supply and
demand,which should lead to enhanced
margins on both new and used cars.
For all these reasons,we are excited by
our future prospects,while recognising
the medium-term challenges that we face.
And we have a number of Inchcape-speciﬁc
factors that give us great conﬁdence.
We operate as market leader in many
markets with a scale position and with
brand partners who continue to outperform
the industry and who have the resources
to innovate and stimulate demand.We will
beneﬁt from a pipeline of new products
which are set to deliver better value,better
performance and lower CO2 emissions.
Following a period of integration,our aim
is to have established scale operations in
emerging markets,enabling them to make
a growing contribution to the Group.
Our decentralised organisational model
gives us a signiﬁcant advantage as we
are capable of responding rapidly to the
changes in our industry.
Superior levels of customer service based
on our differentiating Customer 1st strategy
and leading retail operating systems will
help us grow share in many of our markets.
As an organisation,we will be leaner and
more efﬁcient which will provide us with
leverage when the market returns.
Further,I am constantly impressed by
the quality of our employees across the
Group.Despite the economic downturn,
I see our people displaying a true
‘Inchcape spirit’and a real passion for
delivering exceptional customer service.
In short,our proven business model and
strategy,allied with the ﬁrm and prudent
actions being taken by our experienced
management teams today,mean that
Inchcape is set to emerge from the
current downturn leaner,stronger and
more successful than ever.
We are conﬁdent that we will emerge
a winner.

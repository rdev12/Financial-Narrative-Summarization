 Chief Executive’s Statement
Strategy Overview
I am delighted to confirm another excellent year for the Southern
Cross Group. 
During a year in which we have successfully listed the Company’s
shares on the London Stock Exchange, we have continued to grow
our market presence, by adding volume to both of our principal
business streams and expanding our development pipeline. Our
funding strategy and business model ensures that we can continue
to increase shareholder returns without recourse to additional
shareholder equity, as the last 12 months’ activity has demonstrated.
Strategically, the Group remains committed to the long-term care
market, targeting further growth in both core and specialist divisions.
The demand for long-term care services is anticipated to increase
substantially over the next 25 years. On the basis that the
percentage of elderly people currently living in residential 
care homes in each of the age groups 65 years to 74 years, 
75 years to 84 years and over 85 remains unchanged, then the
application of those percentages to forecast census figures from
2006 to 2031 suggests a need for an average of 14,000 new beds
per annum just to satisfy emerging demand. 
Given the ongoing contraction of supply in the marketplace – as 
a consequence of small providers selling their properties to realise
the land value which is often greater than the care home business
value, occupancy levels over the next few years are likely to reach
capacity in excess of the current level of 91%, a figure which
includes a portfolio of immature development homes.
We believe that the typical dependency levels of persons living 
in care homes today are such that 24-hour care is required to 
meet the range of social and nursing care needs presented. 
Whilst supportive of Government’s strategy of ensuring elderly
people have options for home care if possible, we remain
convinced that with a reducing pool of taxpayers due to an ageing
population, the residential care model continues to offer “best
economic value” for 24-hour care services. At current average
weekly fee rates, of £465 for Elderly Care this equates to a price 
of just over £2.75 per hour.
We will therefore continue to pursue our strategy of increasing
capacity via acquisition and organic growth programmes in
anticipation of the growing demand for our services. 
As the UK’s largest provider, we still have only a 6% share of a 
£12 billion revenue market, and consequently have resourced our
development and acquisition teams to ensure that we continue 
to add capacity and increase our market penetration over the next
five years.
Group Branding
With two business streams (elderly care and specialist services), 
we have redefined our marketing strategy this year to create an
additional brand, targeted specifically at clients who are funding
their own placement. Rather like the hotel sector, we now offer –
via our Ashbourne Senior Living brand – facilities with higher
accommodation standards and those additional services often
requested by self-funding residents.

During another excellent year, we have continued
to consolidate the long-term care sector to become
the UK market leader, as well as successfully listing
our business on the London Stock Exchange.
Philip Scott Chief Executive The Southern Cross brand will continue to predominantly cater for
residents who are funded by local authorities. Those placements
are generally procured on an agreed service specification linked 
to client dependency and price. Active Care Partnerships is our
specialist services brand providing younger people with as much
support as required to maximise their ability to lead active and
independent lives. 
Acquisition Activity
During the year we acquired the Ashbourne Group adding a further
193 leasehold care homes and over 10,000 beds to group capacity.
Integration of that portfolio is now complete and I am pleased to
report that occupancy has increased in that portfolio by 2% since
acquisition in November 2005.
In addition to the Ashbourne purchase, we added a total of 950
beds via small bolt on transactions.
This includes, post-flotation, the “United A” portfolio that added 
270 beds to the Group. All beds, except for the “United A” portfolio,
were funded utilising landlord facilities in line with our current
funding strategy. We will shortly exchange contracts for the on-sale
of the “United A” freeholds to one of our landlord funds.
Development Pipeline
Our development pipeline has expanded significantly and we
currently have in excess of 2,000 beds in various stages of planning
and construction. A further 1,000 beds will be delivered and open
for business by the end of December 2007. Particular areas of focus
continue to be Northern Ireland (NI) and Scotland (SC) where
demographic pressure is increasing demand for elderly care services.
During the year we have opened a 64-bedded facility in Enniskillen
(NI), 90 beds in Wishaw and 85 beds in Renfrew (both SC). We
have also added an 80-bedded unit in York and a further 66 beds
by way of extensions to existing facilities.
In addition we have added two specialist units in Scotland under
the Active Care Partnerships brand. 
Disposal Programme
The Group continues to review the long-term sustainability of
particular homes acquired as part of material acquisitions. In the
last 12 months we have assigned the leasehold interest for three
homes that did not meet our trading performance expectations and
were unlikely to do so in the long term. As part of the Ashbourne
acquisition, we acquired a number of unencumbered freeholds. 
Two of these have been sold and a further five will be marketed
for sale given the age and limitations of the properties. We are
likely to achieve a small profit on the disposal of these businesses.
Sale and Leaseback Financing
The Group has funded its growth using sale and leaseback financing
since incorporation in 1996. That funding mechanism remains at
the core of our financing strategy and I am delighted to report that
we have secured £300m of landlord funds available for a two-year
period at a fixed initial yield, to enable us to continue our
acquisition plan unabated. These funds give us real visibility over
forward rents and over the last year we have as a consequence of
our covenant strength, continued to access new funding sources
with relatively low yield expectations.

Market Outlook 
With the anticipated demographic pressures compounded by the
continued contraction in supply and the ongoing burden of legislation
(such as the Care Standards Act and National Minimum Wage)
pushing up operating costs, we expect that fee rates will continue to
rise in excess of inflation. That is essential to reduce the number of
beds leaving the market, to encourage new development to meet
the anticipated emerging demand and to provide full cost recovery 
in respect of increased legislation. 
Given the quality of our modern, well-invested, purpose-built portfolio
and the fact that we are now compliant with most of the legislative
requirements that required material capital expenditure, we expect
our operating costs to remain relatively stable. Home payroll costs
account for the largest proportion of our operating cost base. However,
we have a recognition agreement with the GMB union and 
therefore continue to have real visibility over likely cost increases, 
as negotiation and agreement of pay awards precede fee reviews. 
In addition, we continue to recruit personnel directly from overseas
and as a consequence our reliance on agency personnel has
continued to reduce during the year.
Acquisition and development opportunities continue to present
themselves and we expect to participate in the ongoing
consolidation of the sector. We are on course to exceed our annual
target of adding 1,200 beds in 2007 and therefore our efforts are
now focused on adding to the 2008 development pipeline.

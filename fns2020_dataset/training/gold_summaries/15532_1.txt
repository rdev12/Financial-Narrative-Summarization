 The Board is pleased to report that profit before tax for 
the year to 31 March 2011 is in line with expectations at 
£3.0 million after exceptional items (2010: £7.3 million). 
Although the number of open market properties 
completed in the year is lower at 281 (2010: 389) the  
Group has experienced strong demand for early sales 
of its future developments, particularly from purchasers 
in the Far East, such that the number of sales secured 
by contracts exchanged in the year has increased to 
368 (2010: 253). As a result of this and continued sales 
of affordable housing to our housing association partners, 
the Group has revenue secured by contracts exchanged 
of over £135 million to flow into the business over the  
next three years.
Sales and completions
Telford Homes is in the middle of a two year period 
during which the number of open market homes being 
finished is lower than capacity. The Group refrained from 
investing in new land during the recession and, given the 
average construction period for a development is two 
years, this is affecting the number of homes available  
for sale and legal completion up to the middle of 2012. 
Therefore the decline in the number of open market 
completions in the year to 31 March 2011 is caused more 
by the reduced supply of finished homes than by market 
demand or the ability to make sales. Overall sales 
performance has been better than expected due to the 
successful off-plan marketing of developments that are 
due to be finished between mid-2012 and mid-2014.
Profit margins in the year to 31 March 2011 have been 
affected by changes made during the recession to 
favour affordable housing and by impaired open market 
developments that were acquired by the Group in 2006 
and 2007. As expected this combination of reduced 
supply of finished open market homes and lower profit 
margins has brought total profits in the business down. 
The impact of both will continue into the year to 
31 March 2012 such that the Board expects profit 
before exceptional items to be similar year-on-year. 
Almost all of the developments that switched to 
affordable housing and those impaired by prices falling 
during the recession will have worked through the 
development pipeline by the end of the new financial year.
The rate of sales of finished homes to UK buyers  
has remained steady and visitor levels to the Group’s 
sales centres have been consistent during the year. 
Construction of the third and final phase of Queen 
Mary’s Gate in Woodford finished towards the end  
of 2010 and we now have fewer than 60 homes left  
to sell out of nearly 500 across the development. In 
September 2010 the Group acquired The Royal Bank  
of Scotland’s 50 per cent interest in Telford Homes 
(Creekside) Limited, the joint venture set up to develop 
Greenwich Creekside. This development is undergoing  
a period of phased handovers and over half of the  
121 open market homes in the first phase have now 
been handed over to their purchasers.
The availability of mortgage finance for new build 
properties remains the most significant restriction  
on demand in the UK and this is particularly true for first  
time buyers. Bank of England statistics show mortgage 
approvals have been continuing at a steady rate, albeit at 
just 40 per cent of the long term average. Whilst there 
have been some signs of improvement in the number 
of mortgages available, the Council of Mortgage 
Lenders expects gross lending for housing to be 
unchanged in 2011.

Alongside a steady UK market, overseas launches 
including Matchmakers Wharf, E9, the Hawksmoors, E1 
and, in April and May 2011, Avant-garde in Shoreditch 
have been very successful. Avant-garde is located just  
a few minutes from Liverpool Street station and over 
120 off-plan sales have been secured with buyers in 
the Far East, an unprecedented performance for this 
type of development. There has been equally strong 
off-plan demand in the recovering London market 
such that in total over 170 of the 257 open market 
homes have been sold in just two months of initial 
marketing. Construction is underway and handovers  
will take place from late 2013 onwards.
The majority of overseas sales are secured with a 20 
per cent deposit either all paid at contract exchange  
or paid in stages not later than one year before 
completion. This provides the Group with equity to be 
used for further site acquisitions and the repayment of 
debt. The Group will continue to market appropriate 
developments overseas to secure revenue that will  
be recognised on legal completions in future years.
Partnerships and affordable housing
Telford Homes remains a grant partner of the  
Homes and Communities Agency (“HCA”) and has now 
completed the first four developments under its 2008 
to 2011 grant agreement. The Group has received £55.1 
million out of a total grant allocation of £72.9 million and 
the vast majority of the remainder will be received 
by March 2012 as affordable homes are completed in 
accordance with their construction programmes.
The Group has a secured revenue stream contracted for 
the affordable housing on all of its current developments 
and is now developing a greater proportion of open 
market housing such that it is not reliant on future, 
uncertain, grant funding. New opportunities are 
appraised on a conditional basis until the value and 
amount of affordable housing required is clear.
The Spending Review has had a significant impact on 
the new four year affordable housing grant programme 
for 2011 to 2015. Central funding for new projects is 
expected to be around 25 per cent of the total grant 
allocation for 2008 to 2011 and housing associations 
have been invited to close the funding gap by charging 
higher rents to new tenants under the new ‘affordable 
rent’ model. This will only partially substitute for the 
reduction in government funding and therefore less 
affordable housing will be built. 
There remains a housing shortage in London and 
Telford Homes will continue to work with both the HCA 
and the local authorities to address the need for new 
housing developments to be brought forward and to 
provide affordable housing whilst ensuring that each 
new development remains financially viable.
l and acquisition
The developments in the Group’s ownership during 
2008 and 2009 were in good locations and were flexible 
in terms of housing mix such that write downs were 
less than three per cent of total assets and profitable 
development could proceed with increased levels of 
affordable housing. However the impact of not investing 
in new sites during the recession, albeit a necessity at 
the time, is now being felt in terms of reduced output.
In February 2010 Telford Homes raised £7.2 million  
of equity through a placing of new shares to bolster  
the Group’s ability to purchase land. In addition to this 
the Board was delighted to sign a three and a half year 
£70 million banking facility with The Royal Bank of 
Scotland, HSBC and Santander on 31 March 2011.  
The process to secure this finance involved a year of 
extensive investigation of every aspect of the business 
and its financial position. It is great credit to Telford 
Homes that at the end of this process these three major 
banks are prepared to support the Group to this extent.

TEF2681 - AR11 front AW02.indd   13 13/06/2011   10:49 The new banking facility provides significant headroom 
for future investment but even without this finance 
the Group has been acquiring land. The successful 
partnership with Eastend Homes to develop new homes 
across several estates in Tower Hamlets continues and 
during the last twelve months the Group has exercised 
options to purchase eight sites to provide 141 new open 
market homes. The Group’s partnership with Poplar 
HARCA also resumed in the year with contracts in place 
for the development of four sites.
The Group’s development pipeline is the total number 
of properties not yet legally completed that are to be 
constructed on land in its ownership or held under 
option contracts. A significant number of affordable 
homes, 400, have been completed during the year 
with revenue and profit having been recognised over 
the entire construction period. The total number of 
properties in the pipeline was 1,904 at 31 March 2011 
(2010: 2,370) with finance in place to significantly add to 
this over the next few years. On 27 May 2011 the Group 
exchanged contracts with Eastend Homes to develop 
209 new homes on the Holland Estate on Commercial 
Street, E1, increasing the number of properties in the 
development pipeline to over 2,100.
All of the Group’s developments have planning permission 
and the Group is careful to limit its exposure to planning 
risk, especially given uncertainty over future planning 
policy and the impact of ‘localism’. The New Homes Bonus 
introduced by the coalition government is valuable to local 
authorities and it is hoped that this will encourage a more 
pragmatic approach to planning policy where appropriate. 
Telford Homes is working with several landowners to 
secure planning for developments that are not yet 
under the Group’s control. 
Operations
Few developers possess the expertise and experience 
of Telford Homes in East London. The quality of the 
Group’s developments both in design and construction 
has been recognised by many awards in the last year 
including two special commendations from the London 
Evening Standard 2010 Homes and Property Awards 
and two National House-Building Council awards.
An independent survey of the Group’s customers 
throughout 2010 resulted in a 97% customer 
recommendation rate, a record high. The reasons 
include the quality of the finished apartments, the lack  
of defects and the high level of customer service 
provided. Once again the Board extends its gratitude 
to each of the Group’s employees, without whom the 
excellent standards maintained across every part of 
the business would not be possible.
Board changes
I am standing down as Chief Executive with effect  
from 30 June 2011 and I look forward to returning as 
Executive Chairman in 2012. At that time I will take on 
special responsibility for land acquisition alongside the 
normal responsibilities of the Chairman. I look forward 
to remaining with Telford Homes for many years to 
come working alongside Jon Di-Stefano as he steps into 
the role of Chief Executive. I would like to thank David 
Holland for his significant contribution to the business  
in his ten years as Non-Executive Chairman and I am 
pleased that he will also remain on the Board as the 
Senior Non-Executive Director. 
I am also delighted to announce the appointment of 
Katie Rogers as our new Financial Director with effect 
from the Annual General Meeting on 14 July 2011. Katie 
has been with Telford Homes for three and a half years 
and is currently the Group’s Financial Controller. She has 
been instrumental in securing the new banking facility 
and is well known to the Group’s bankers.

TEF2681 - AR11 front AW02.indd   15 13/06/2011   10:49 Current trading and outlook
A high level of sales has been maintained throughout  
the last year due primarily to overseas pre-sales. Since 
1 April 2011 this trend has continued and, with the 
successful launch of Avant-garde, the Group has already 
sold 200 open market homes in the new financial  
year of which over 130 have been secured by  
exchanging contracts.
Profits are expected to remain at a similarly reduced 
level in the year to 31 March 2012 but the developments 
that switched to affordable housing or were impaired 
during the recession will be finished by the middle of 
2012 and significant growth both in output and margin 
is expected in future years. The number of pre-sales 
being achieved on developments that will be completed 
from 2012 onwards gives the Board confidence in this 
expectation and as such the dividend being paid this 
year has been increased by 25 per cent to 2.5 pence.
The Group has finance in place to add to the development 
pipeline and the market in East London remains robust 
and the subject of significant and ongoing undersupply. 
The 2012 Olympics in London are just over a year away 
and East London can only benefit from the anticipation 
and excitement that this major event brings to the area, 
let alone the substantial investment already made. The 
longer term prospects for Telford Homes remain strong.

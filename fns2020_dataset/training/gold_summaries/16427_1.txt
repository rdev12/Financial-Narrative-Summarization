Performance
We are pleased to have 
delivered another year of 
good performance in what 
remains a difficult economic 
environment for customers 
in the North West of 
England. Underpinning all we 
do is our vision of becoming 
a leading North West service 
provider and one of the best 
UK water and wastewater 
companies and we have 
made progress against this 
objective on a broad front.
High levels of customer satisfaction 
remain our core objective. We have 
again delivered a year of improvement 
as measured by our regulator, Ofwat’s, 
Service Incentive Mechanism (SIM). 
This places us as one of the most 
improved companies for customer 
satisfaction over the last three years. 
Whilst comparison with other 
water and sewerage companies is 
an important benchmark for us, we 
recognise that customer expectations 
are often set by standards of service 
delivered by other companies 
operating in the North West. So 
we conduct a brand tracker survey 
and we are happy to ﬁnd ourselves 
consistently ranked third out of ten 
leading companies, just behind the 
respected brands of John Lewis  
and Marks & Spencer. 
Even so, we don’t always get it right, 
and customer satisfaction will remain 
an area of focus for us – reducing 
service failure beneﬁts both customers 
and shareholders.  
Targeted investment in our people, 
assets and processes is delivering 
results and we are ahead of 
schedule in delivering our regulatory 
outperformance targets.
Asset serviceability has again been 
stable or improving over the last twelve 
months and we have met our leakage 
target for the eighth consecutive year. 
Water quality over the year reﬂects our 
best performance for many years. The 
Environment Agency assessed us as 
an  upper quartile company in 2012/13, 
and we have made more progress over 
the last twelve months.
Much of our capital programme of over 
£3.5 billion for the period 2010–15 
supports renewal and upgrade of our 
asset base to maintain serviceability 
but a signiﬁcant proportion also 
delivers our capability to meet 
new environmental standards. We 
delivered our largest annual capital 
programme for a decade, investing 
£836 million – £49 million more than 
the previous year – in areas that 
included contributions to river and 
bathing water quality and inspecting 
the Haweswater aqueduct for the 
ﬁrst time since it was built in the mid 
1900s. We measure the effectiveness 
of our investment using our Time, Cost 
and Quality index, TCQi, and we scored 
98 per cent for the year – ahead of our 
targets and a signiﬁcant improvement 
on our performance of three years ago.
Our good performance in this ﬁve-
year regulatory period, AMP5, has 
created the ability for us to re-invest. 
We are investing around £200 million 
of capital savings into projects which 
improve service to customers or 
beneﬁt the environment. 
Around £40 million of our ﬁnancing 
outperformance is supporting our 
private sewer network and we have 
committed a £75 million cash tax 
refund from HMRC to assist customers 
struggling to return to regular 
payment. We believe that this reﬂects 
a responsible approach to sharing the 
beneﬁts of outperformance between 
customers and shareholders. 
The North West remains a region 
with the highest proportion of 
disadvantaged households in England 
and reducing customer indebtedness 
continues to be a major challenge 
for us. Our collection teams have 
worked hard in another difﬁcult year 
to hold bad debt levels at 2.2 per 
cent of revenue, with over 30,000 
customers taking advantage of our 
many assistance schemes. Containing 
bad debt at this level will remain a 
challenge as beneﬁt reforms continue 
to roll out across our region.  
“ Our good performance 
in this ﬁve-year 
regulatory period has 
created the ability for 
us to reinvest. ”

3rd
out of 10 leading North 
West service providers,

Shareholder information Financial statements Governance Strategic report
Strategic report > Business overview > Chairman’s and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s statement We are grasping the opportunities 
presented by reform of water 
regulation. We welcome the opening of 
the competitive business retail market 
for water and United Utilities Scotland 
has rapidly secured a proﬁtable 
position as the largest new-entrant 
business retailer in Scotland, second 
only to the incumbent, Business 
Stream. The lessons learned in 
Scotland will be applied in the English 
market, delivering better customer 
service in the run-up to market opening 
in 2017 and beyond. In mid 2013 we 
launched a range of on-site water and 
wastewater services to add value to 
non-household customers in our region.
Strategy
During the last year, we updated our 
Strategic Direction Statement, ‘Playing 
our part to support the North West’ , 
and this document reﬂects extensive 
consultation with customers and other 
stakeholders to generate our best view 
of what the next 25 years holds for the 
region. This includes economic, social 
and environmental developments such 
as the increasing impact of climate 
change.
Our business plan, published in 
December 2013, sets out our plans for 
the 2015-20 period. We sought the 
views of over 27,000 customers, as 
well as consulting with our regulators, 
to deliver a plan which we believe 
strikes the right balance for all our 
stakeholders. 
The North West is home to some of the 
most beautiful rural areas of the UK, 
supporting a diverse and productive 
agricultural sector. These areas of 
natural beauty, combined with a long 
coastline, mean that tourism is an 
important sector in the regional 
economy, contributing some £3.2 
billion per annum. The EU’s Water 
Framework and Bathing Water 
Directives target the protection and 
enhancement of this environment and 
our plans set an appropriate pace for 
implementation of new environmental 
legislation, balanced against the size 
of bill that customers are prepared to 
pay.  
Our plans recognise that as a lone 
agent United Utilities could not deliver 
the scale of required environmental 
improvement at an acceptable level 
of cost. Instead, we are committing 
to partnering with others who can 
support the achievement of the 
required outcomes. This includes 
our ‘Turning Tides’ partnership with 
the Environment Agency, Local 
Authorities, the Marine Conservation 
Society and others to improve bathing 
waters in the North West. 
Our updated Water Resources 
Management Plan describes the 
expected pattern of water resource 
availability in our region until 2040.  
The majority of the North West 
is in surplus, beneﬁtting from an 
integrated network that supports 
movement of water across the region 
to accommodate its changing supply 
and demand balance. Our business 
plan focuses on maintaining existing 
levels of service across the region, 
whilst acting to improve the security of 
supply to West Cumbria by connecting 
it to our integrated network. This is 
necessary because the need to protect 
the local environment puts West 
Cumbria’s future supply and demand 
balance at risk.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 A fair deal for customers
We have continued to invest heavily 
in schemes designed to mitigate the 
risk of ﬂooding of our customers’ 
homes. This includes incidence based 
targeting on areas more likely to 
experience ﬂooding and more use of 
CCTV sewer surveys to identify issues. 
For 2015–20 we are targeting a further 
reduction in the risk of sewer ﬂooding 
inside customers’ properties, seeking 
opportunities to work in partnership 
with others to deliver cost-effective 
joint schemes and promoting the use 
of more sustainable drainage systems. 
Our wastewater network will continue 
to beneﬁt from signiﬁcant investment 
going forward as we adapt to weather 
patterns likely to result from climate 
change. 
We are developing a new business 
operating model for our wholesale 
business area, embracing innovation 
in control technology and work 
processes. Delivery of this business 
model is critical to our future ability 
to offset the growth in bills arising 
from new environmental regulation 
whilst continuing to deliver our target 
return for shareholders.  Our progress 
over the current regulatory period, 
combined with our plans for further 
improvements in the next ﬁve years, 
will mean average household bills will 
have grown by less than inﬂation in the 
decade to 2020.
Attractive deal for shareholders
Good underlying operational 
performance, effective capital 
programme delivery and improving 
levels of customer satisfaction are 
delivering value for our shareholders. 
Revenue increased by 4.2 per cent to 
£1.70 billion and underlying operating 
proﬁt was up 6.1 per cent to £641 
million in continued difﬁcult economic 
conditions. Underlying earnings per 
share increased by 16 per cent to 44.7 
pence. We remain on track to deliver 
operating expenditure outperformance 
and to meet Ofwat’s allowance on our 
capital programme, after reinvesting 
our outperformance.   
We plan to continue with high levels 
of investment for 2014/15. This 
includes bringing forward some of our 
scheduled 2015-20 spend to ensure 
a smoother investment proﬁle. We 
have now invested over £2.9 billion in 
the ﬁrst four years of the 2010–15 
regulatory period, and we remain on 
track to deliver our planned ﬁve-year 
investment programme.
We intend to continue with our 
dividend policy of targeting growth of 
RPI+2 per cent per annum through to at 
least 2015 while delivering signiﬁcant 
improvements for customers and the 
environment. In line with this policy, 
the board is proposing a ﬁnal dividend 
of 24.03 pence per ordinary share 
making a total of 36.04 pence per 
share for the 2013/14 ﬁnancial year. 
This represents an increase of 5.0 
per cent compared with last year. The 
ﬁnal dividend is expected to be paid to 
shareholders on 1 August 2014. 
Responsible business 
We continue to listen to the views of 
all our stakeholders and endeavour 
to develop, manage and operate 
in an environmentally sustainable, 
economically beneﬁcial and socially 
responsible manner. In recognition 
of the company’s continued focus on 
responsible business, we retained both 
our ‘World Class’ rating, as measured 
by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index 
and our ‘Platinum Big Tick’ ranking in 
Business in the Community Corporate 
Responsibility Index. We are proud 
that we are one of only seven FTSE 
100 companies (and the only water 
company) to hold both accolades.
The communities where we operate 
are where our customers and 
employees live and work and are vital 
to our business.  We have continued to 
support these North West communities 
both ﬁnancially and in terms of 
employee time through volunteering.  
For example, our ‘Beachcare’ employee 
volunteering scheme, working in 
partnership with the Environment 
Agency and others, helps to keep our 
region’s beaches tidy.
Through our role as a major employer, 
training provider and wealth creator, 
we help to keep the North West’s 
economy turning. Between 2010 and 
2015, our activities will generate an 
estimated £7 billion for the region’s 
economy, supporting 9,000 jobs, and 
securing a legacy for the future.

Strategic report > Business overview > Chairman’s and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s statement Our employees
The people in United Utilities are key 
to the delivery of the highest levels 
of service to our customers and we 
would like again to thank them for 
their dedication and continued hard 
work during the year. Notwithstanding 
the amount of change our business is 
undertaking, employee engagement 
sits at 79 per cent, well above the  
UK transitional norm and close to the 
norm for high performing companies 
in the UK.  
We strive to continuously improve 
our safety culture and we have 
implemented a number of initiatives 
throughout the year. We launched a 
managers’ guide for health and safety 
responsibilities and our transformation 
project, covering 13 key areas of focus 
across our business, is progressing 
well. These initiatives helped reduce 
the number of employee accidents 
in 2013/14 and this will remain a 
signiﬁcant area of focus for us.
A committed, capable and motivated 
workforce is central to delivering our 
vision and we remain fully focused on 
maintaining high levels of employee 
development and engagement.  We 
are always on the lookout for the 
best and brightest talent and we 
recruited a further 24 graduates and 
32 apprentices in 2013/14 and we 
have plans to recruit a similar number 
in 2014/15.
Our board
As a board we are responsible to our 
shareholders, customers and other 
stakeholders for the performance and 
long-term success of our company. The 
way in which we operate, we believe, 
already reﬂects the highest standards 
of corporate governance. Our plc 
structure and governance standards 
ensure that our board and non-
executive directors continue to provide 
sound and prudent governance in full 
compliance with the principles of the 
UK Corporate Governance Codes.

United Utilities Group PLC
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2014 “ A committed, capable 
and motivated 
workforce is central to 
delivering our vision. ”
On behalf of the board, we say thank 
you and farewell to Nick Salmon, who 
will stand down at this year’s annual 
general meeting after over nine years 
as a non-executive director. We wish 
Nick all the best for the future. We 
are pleased to welcome Mark Clare to 
the board following his appointment 
last November as a non-executive 
director. Mark is a member of the 
audit committee and the nomination 
committee and will replace Nick as 
senior independent director. Mark 
is Group Chief Executive at Barratt 
Developments PLC and his expertise 
will be an asset to the board.
Outlook
We believe that our sustained focus on 
operational performance, combined 
with continued substantial investment 
in our assets, is delivering beneﬁts 
for customers, shareholders and 
the environment. We are on track to 
exceed our regulatory outperformance 
targets, with substantial ﬁnancing and 
operating outperformance already 
secured. Our capital structure remains 
robust and we intend to continue with 
our dividend policy of targeting real 
growth through to at least 2015.  
Looking ahead, our focus remains 
centred on driving further customer 
satisfaction, alongside operational and 
environmental improvements and we 
believe there is still plenty of scope to 
achieve this. We have now submitted 
our business plan for the 2015–20 
period, as we aim to strike the right 
balance between all our stakeholders. 
We will continue constructive 
engagement with our regulators, ahead 
of the draft and ﬁnal determinations 
from Ofwat later this year.

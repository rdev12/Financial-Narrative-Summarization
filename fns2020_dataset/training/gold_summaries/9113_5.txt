QUESTION
Kentz has achieved another strong 
year of growth. How have your 
operations performed? 
ANSWER
Our target coming into 2013 was to 
deliver double digit earnings growth* 
and I’m delighted to say our adjusted 
earnings* grew by 17.3% in the year. 
Our TSS business unit has had a 
particularly strong year as we 
continue to offer our services to 
more clients in more locations. 
Revenue from our Construction and 
EPC business units have fallen in 
2013 but we expect to see an 
improvement in 2014. For 
Construction, slower progress in a 
couple of projects in the first half of 
2013 meant lower than expected 
revenues but we expect this will 
catch up in 2014. We are seeing 
more bidding activity in EPC in 
recent months with a number of 
awards being made to Kentz which 
provides confidence for this year and 
beyond. Of course, Valerus who we 
acquired on 3 January 2014 will also 
add significant revenues to the EPC 
business in 2014. 
QUESTION
The acquisition of Valerus is a 
significant addition to the Group. 
How will this new business change 
Kentz?
ANSWER
The acquisition of Valerus satisfies 
the strategic initiative of building out 
EPC. Valerus adds to our engineering 
capability and provides us with 
process engineering expertise to 
allow us to provide EPC for small to 
medium onshore process facilities. 
Valerus also provides material entry 
into the US and Latin American 
markets where Kentz’s exposure 
to date has been limited. We don’t 
plan to integrate Valerus into Kentz 
right away but we see great business 
development opportunities for the 
combined entity as there is little 
overlap in our respective 
client bases. 
QUESTION
You have worked in this industry for 
20 years and have now been CEO of 
Kentz for two years, what do you 
believe makes Kentz different?
ANSWER
I think it is important for us to 
continue to differentiate ourselves as 
our sector has disappointed many 
clients and investors in the past 
couple of years. Showing why we are 
different and not going to disappoint 
is key and mainly due to the 
following factors: 
1 We have developed strong client 
relationships through a proven 
track record of successful project 
execution over the past three 
decades. Fundamental to this 
success have been the 
outstanding contributions made 
by our highly skilled and 
motivated workforce and retaining 
this talent throughout the 
business cycle. The collaborative 
efforts of the projects teams 
create significant value in project 
execution and explains why 80% 
of our work is from clients that we 
have served in the past.
2 We have operating flexibility 
through a differentiated service 
offering across the entire project 
value chain so we can provide 
many services to one project. 
3 Our operations have geographical 
diversity which allows for global 
positioning to support projects 
worldwide.
4 Although we operate largely in the 
oil and gas sector, we are a service 
provider and work in other sectors 
such as mining, power and 
infrastructure which provide 
flexibility and further 
opportunities.
QUESTION
Many companies in this sector are 
experiencing delays or cancellations 
in projects which seems to be 
impacting their growth plans. How 
has Kentz been affected by changes 
in client behaviour?
ANSWER
To date, we have not seen any 
significant delays or cancellations  
to our projects. Delays to projects 
occur for a host of reasons, but our 
decentralised operating model 
ensures that frequent, meaningful 
communications with our clients 
provide us with the ability to foresee 
delays and respond before it seriously 
impacts our earnings.
There continues to be a huge 
opportunity for Kentz to provide its 
broad service offering to our clients. 
This is evident by the growing pipeline 
of prospects that has increased 18% in 
2013 and has grown steadily in the 
past five years. This is a metric we 
place a lot of emphasis on internally 
along with monitoring our clients’ 
investment plans.
QUESTION
Where will the focus be over the 
next 12 months?
ANSWER
During 2014, we will continue what 
we do best: to deliver projects for our 
clients ensuring that safety is always 
our greatest focus, enabling our and 
our clients’ staff to go home safe and 
well. We have grown strongly since 
we listed six years ago and I believe 
we will continue to grow and expand 
our operations, services and client 
base. We are making great strides in 
delivering our strategic initiatives and 
we are always looking to the future to 
ensure we have growth plans that will 
continue to create shareholder value.

CHAIRMAN’S
ST A TEMENT
Peter Bertram
Chairman
We are also delighted that David Simpson has joined the
Board as Group Finance Director. David had been the Group
Financial Controller at Phoenix since 2001. David replaces
David Taylor who, since 2004, was the Group Finance
Director and had been instrumental in the Group’s
development and its successful listing on the London Stock
Exchange. The contribution he made to the Group is greatly
appreciated and he leaves Phoenix with our best wishes.
In addition, Steve Neville was promoted to Managing Director 
of Phoenix IT Services in January 2006, having been with the
Company since 1998 in a variety of senior management roles.
Steve previously held senior positions in Olivetti UK. Dennis
Thomas joined NDR as Managing Director in August 2005,
having previously been a senior executive at Synstar Group.
EMPLOYEES
The Group’s progress made this year could not have been
achieved without the excellent efforts of all our staff. Phoenix 
is a service business and so commitment to our customers 
is key to the Group’s success. I would like to thank all of our
staff for their dedication and efforts during the year.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Annual General Meeting will be held at the Group’s head
office, Technology House, Hunsbury Hill Avenue, Northampton
on Thursday 3 August 2006 at 10.30 am. Formal notice of
the meeting together with the necessary proxy forms is
enclosed with these financial statements.
OUTLOOK
Market conditions remain competitive with customers
demanding a high standard of service with a keen focus 
on price. This is particularly the case in the increasingly
commoditised desktop services market.
We continue to deliver a high quality of service as evidenced
by the renewal of our largest contract in January 2006. 
The effect of the reduction in revenues and returns from 
this contract will take full effect in the current financial year. 
There are no major contract renewals scheduled for the next
three years.
We are also pleased to see the benefits of our strategy of
focusing on niche markets coming through in these results, 
in particular from the focus on smaller, more complex, and
higher margin IT service contracts and our NDR business
which continues to perform strongly.
The Board is confident of the continuing long-term organic
growth of the Group. In addition, we will continue to explore
opportunities to expand the Group’s range of services and
markets via selective acquisitions.

REVIEW OF THE YEAR
I am very pleased to report an excellent set of results. The Group
has made significant progress during the year, has benefited
from the acquisition of NDR (Holdings) Limited (NDR) in April
2005, and is well positioned to take advantage of the large and
growing IT services market.
Revenue grew by £20.6m (23.3%) to £108.9m (2005:
£88.3m) and operating profit before share option charges,
amortisation of acquired intangibles and flotation expenses
(see page 19) grew by 38.3% to £22.0m (2005: £15.9m).
Profit from operations (after share option charges, amortisation
of acquired intangibles and flotation expenses) increased by
48.9% to £19.4m (2005: £13.0m) and profit before tax
increased by 61.9% to £17.9m (2005: £11.1m).
A review of the year’s trading and results is given in the 
Chief Executive’s review and in the Financial review.
DIVIDEND
The Board recommends a final dividend of 2.76p per share
which, together with the interim dividend of 1.38p per share
paid in February 2006, makes a total dividend of 4.14p 
(2005: 2.4p). If authorised at the Annual General Meeting, 
the dividend will be paid on 8 September 2006 to
Shareholders on the register at the close of business on 
18 August 2006.
BOARD AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT CHANGES 
During the year we announced a number of Board changes
which, together with senior management changes, have
strengthened the management team to help drive the 
business forward.
The Board was very pleased to welcome Brian Sellwood as 
a Non Executive Director on 1 April 2006. Brian brings a
wealth of experience to Phoenix after a successful career at
IBM where he held a range of senior mangement positions. NDR

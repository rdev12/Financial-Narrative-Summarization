Completed five new production 
wells on the Uzenskoye field in 2009.
First full year of production, 
averaging 1,267 barrels of oil per day.
Field facilities upgraded in 2009 to 
improve field uptime.
Russian C1/C2 recoverable reserves 
of 13.5 mmbbl with 32% upgrade of 
C1 reserves to 9.7 mmbbl.
Water injection study on the field.
Maintain/enhance production profile 
and maximise extraction of oil.
Spudded Grafovskaya #1 on the 
Yuzhny Ershovskoye prospect on 
28 August 2009.
Successfully drilled through the 
salt layer to 3,900 metres depth.
Encountered light oil in a carbonate 
sequence between 4,000 and  
4,300 metres. Estimated 
permeability is low but will be 
subject to further evaluation.
Grafovskaya #1 reached total depth 
of 5,379 metres in April 2010.
Further shows of hydrocarbon in 
deeper horizons. The commercial 
significance is yet to be established.
Evaluation and testing of potential 
reservoirs is to be conducted.

`
Completed seismic commitment 
on the licence. 
Acquired, processed and 
interpreted new 3-D seismic data.
Large sub-salt exploration 
structure confirmed.
 
Preparation to meet target for 
exploration drilling by 2011.
Completed acquisition, processing 
and interpretation of 340km 
 
of  
2-D seismic.
Planning for a commitment well  
in 2010.
Drill a step-out appraisal/
exploration well close to the 
existing oil discovery well.
First two development wells 
completed and wellhead facilities 
constructed ready for production.
Intra-field flow lines installed.
Negotiations with Trans Nafta on 
gas processing unit.
Russian C1/C2 reserves approved.
Aim to commence test production 
from the initial two wells.
Our assets are located in a proven  
area of large oil and gas finds. The area 
benefits from the existing rail, road and 
pipeline infrastructure and proximity 
to Russiaâ€™s main energy markets.
Successful development drilling 
on the Uzenskoye field enabled 
the Company to achieve positive 
operating cash flow and EBITDA 
in 2009. With eventual 
completion of the Vostochny 
Makarovskoye project and 
further potential developments, 
the Company aspires to further 
growth in production in the 
medium term. 
Meanwhile as we evaluate the 
resources encountered and 
identified in the sub-salt 
structures in the Karpenskiy 
Licence Area and the Pre-
Caspian Licence Area, the 
Company has the potential  
to deliver material growth  
in reserves.

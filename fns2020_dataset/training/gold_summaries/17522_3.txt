 2 Xtract	Energy			 Annual	Report	2007
Highlights Chairman’s	Statement
The past eighteen months 
have proven both exciting and 
challenging for Xtract Energy and 
the results achieved during this 
period now place the company in 
a sound and promising position to 
create wealth for its shareholders.
We now hold a diversified and 
strong portfolio of energy assets 
and technologies which, with the 
addition of significant holdings 
in MEO Australia Ltd and Elko 
Energy Inc, now includes five key 
areas of interests.  
We achieved very positive results 
from the initial validation tests of 
Xtract Energy’s oil shale extraction 
technology. These results indicated 
the potential of doubling crude oil 
recovery from our shale oil deposits 
in Australia.
We have also announced several 
new additions to the Board, 
strengthened with individuals who 
have both mining and business 
development experience.  
The company finalised two major 
acquisitions during the period, 
including the acquisition of 
Cambrian Oil & Gas Plc by way of 
scheme of arrangement in mid 2007 
and the purchase of the remaining 
78.3 per cent. of Xtract Oil Ltd in 
February 2006.  A placing of close 
to 110 million ordinary shares 
raising approximately £5.5 million 
cash was finalised in November 
2006 and at this time Xtract Energy 
acquired significant holdings in 
Wasabi Energy Ltd (Wasabi) and 
Aviva Corporation Ltd (Aviva). Both 
of these companies are listed on the 
Australian Stock Exchange (ASX).
In order to simplify our corporate 
structure, it was proposed during 
the financial period to exchange 
Xtract Energy’s Aviva shareholding 
together with an interest in a steel 
making technology, to Wasabi 
for 175 million new shares and 
25 million options in Wasabi. 
This transaction was approved 
by Wasabi shareholders on 2 
August 2007. As a result of this 
transaction, Xtract Energy now 
holds 34.5 per cent. of Wasabi, 
which in turn holds approximately 
18 per cent. of Aviva. 
MEO AustrAliA l td 
MEO Australia Ltd (MEO) is an 
Australian listed company that 
is focused on off-shore gas 
exploration and developing gas-
to-liquids (GTL) projects in the 
Australian waters of the Timor Sea, 
in an area of shallow water known 
as Tassie Shoal. It has secured 
Commonwealth Government 
environmental approvals for two 
large scale (1.8 million tonnes per 
annum (mtpa)) methanol plants 
(50 per cent. interest) and a 3 
mtpa Liquefied Natural Gas plant 
(100 per cent. interest). Tassie Shoal 
is adjacent to the Evans Shoal gas 
field. MEO has successfully farmed 
out some of its interest in NT/P68, 
a nearby exploration permit, in 
order to help fund a critical drilling 
campaign which has commenced 
on schedule in the fourth quarter of 
2007. From a timing perspective, 
we view this as the most advanced 
project in the Xtract Energy portfolio. 
As in any drilling activity there is a 
range of possible outcomes, but 
the existence of 3D seismic and 
the interest of farm-in partners is 
promising. As at 19 October 2007, 
Xtract Energy holds an interest in 
approximately 71.4 million shares in 
MEO, representing approximately 
21.3 per cent. of the issued capital. 
ElkO ENErgy iNc.
Elko Energy Inc. (Elko) is a privately 
held oil and gas exploration company 
which has an interest in a 5,370 km2 
exploration and production licence in 
the Danish North Sea, an interest in a 
gas-bearing block in the Dutch North 
Sea and a majority holding in Dragon 
Energy Inc, a private Canadian 
company, with a 30 per cent. share 
in a producing field in Canada and 
a development project in Gansu 
Province, China. Subsequent to the 
end of the reporting period, Xtract 
Energy increased its interest in Elko 
to 21.8 million shares, representing 
approximately 36.5 per cent. of the 
issued capital.
WAsAbi ENErgy l td
Wasabi is an Australian listed 
company that has a portfolio of 
early-stage energy assets and 
technologies where the upside 
potential is significant. Wasabi’s 
portfolio includes both traditional 
and clean energy investments with 
interests covering coal, uranium, 
biodiesel, geothermal power and 
industrial waste heat recovery. Its 
interests in geothermal and waste 
heat recovery are founded on its 
position as the major shareholder 
of Exergy Inc., the developer and 
owner of patents for the Kalina Cycle 
technology. We see our interest in 
Wasabi as both valuable in its own 
right and as an additional source of 
opportunities for Xtract Energy.

interests include a production

Kyrgyzneftegaz to instigate a water 
injection project on the Beshkent- 
Togap oil field. Xtract Energy 
also holds interests in several 
exploration licences in the Tash 
Kumyr area and in the Toktogul 
exploration licence.
Oil shAlE 
Xtract Energy has oil shale 
and related petroleum product 
exploration rights over mining 
tenements in the Julia Creek area 
of Queensland and has recently 
been granted an exploration permit 
which gives the right to explore for 
oil shale in an area in South Island, 
New Zealand. In conjunction 
with Australian research group 
Commonwealth Scientific and 
Industrial Research Organisation 
(‘CSIRO’), the company’s wholly 
owned subsidiary Xtract Oil 
Ltd has continued to develop 
the Xtract technology, being a 
method of processing oil shale 
in the presence of hydrogen and 
solvents, known as supercritical 
solvent extraction. The initial 
validation tests, comprising small 
scale batch extractions of oil from 
the shale, have demonstrated 
that recovery from Xtract Energy’s 
Julia Creek deposits may be much 
higher than could be achieved 
using conventional retort recovery 
techniques. This has resulted in 
a doubling of the oil potential and 
an estimated in situ oil resource of 
over 1.6 billion barrels of oil.
bOArd ANd MANAgEMENt
Xtract Energy continued to 
strengthen the Board with 
individuals who possess significant 
experience in the energy sector. 
I became Executive Chairman 
in July of this year following the 
appointment of Andy Morrison as 
our new Chief Executive Officer. 
Andy has over 25 years experience 
in the energy and related services 
sectors, most recently with The 
BOC Group as a Group Director for 
New Business Development. He 
has an excellent track record in the 
energy sector and we believe he 
can help the company develop and 
implement its future strategy. John 
Conlon joined as a non-executive 
director in January 2007. John 
has a depth of mining experience 
in various locations throughout 
the world, where he has taken 
projects through from feasibility to 
construction and production. 
FiNANciAl rEsults
The Group reported a net profit 
after tax of £7.5 million (2005: loss 
of £0.2 million) and basic earnings 
per share of 1.49p (2005: loss 
per share 0.21p) for the eighteen 
month period. 
Other gains totalling £6.0 million 
resulted from the fair value 
assessment of options held in MEO 
and realised gains from MEO option 
sales during the period. The value 
of these options is now reflected 
in the carrying value of the MEO 
associate investment following their 
conversion into ordinary shares 
in April 2007 at A$0.25. Negative 
goodwill of £5.7 million arose on 
the acquisition of Cambrian Oil & 
Gas plc (COIL) during the period as 
detailed in note 21 to the financial 
statements. The negative goodwill 
is primarily attributable to the 
increase in the fair value of COIL’s 
MEO shares between the date of 
initial investment in MEO, and the 
effective dates of Xtract Energy’s 
business combination with COIL 
(November 2006 and April 2007).
The Group’s net asset position 
increased significantly during the 
period to £32.4 million as a result 
of acquisition activity during the 
period. This strong balance sheet 
position is further supported 
by cash of £1.6 million and an 
MEO investment market value of 
£45.3 million at 30 June 2007.
OutlOOk
During the forthcoming year the 
Board will continue to identify and 
invest in early stage energy sector 
technologies and businesses 
with significant growth potential. 
We aim to work closely with the 
associated management teams to 
achieve critical project milestones, 
to finance later development stages 
and to build and crystallise value for 
all shareholders and partners. 
We believe that the company 
has now invested in a strong 
and promising portfolio with the 
necessary balance between short 
and longer-term growth positions. 
With this platform in place we are 
looking forward to a rewarding and 
successful future.

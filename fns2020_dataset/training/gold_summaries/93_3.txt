 UBC MEDIA GROUP PLC 2
Chairman’s Statement
This reinforces my belief that UBC has at its core a 
resilient mix of businesses capable of delivering strong 
revenue growth in the face of adverse trading conditions, 
whilst being positioned to beneﬁt from the growth in a 
digital future.
Financial Performance
Revenues grew 21.8% to £19.44 million (2005:  
£15.96 million). Adjusted operating proﬁt* for the year 
increased to £1.56 million (2005: £1.08 million) and 
our total investment in the year developing a music 
downloading service on digital radio was £396,000 
(2005: nil.), of which £326,000 was capitalised. 
Operating loss for the year was £193,000 (2005:  
£1.09 million loss) and loss before taxation for the  
year was £234,000 (2005: £1.16 million loss).
Strategy
UBC’s strategy continues to be to invest the returns from 
our traditional businesses to ﬁnance the Group’s digital 
expansion. Our strong performance in the last year has 
enabled us to build on our vision of how the growth in 
digital radio is changing the way the radio industry will 
operate in the future. The Board proposes to continue  
its investment in digital radio.
During the year, UBC successfully completed the 
ﬁrst stages in the development of its innovative music 
downloading service on radio. The results of our early 
investment have been as good as we hoped and we 
have recently commenced ﬁeld trials of the service.
The outcome of the trials are as yet unknown. However, 
if the next stages in the development programme are 
successful, we plan to launch a full music downloading 
service using DAB digital spectrum within the next  
12 months.
The Team
On behalf of the Board I would like to thank every 
member of our management and staff at UBC for their 
commitment, enthusiasm and hard work. Our business 
depends on creating the very best in radio content.  
To deliver this we have built a talented and dedicated 
team. None of the achievements of the past year would 
have been possible without the creative ﬂair of everyone 
at UBC.
Prospects
I believe UBC starts the new ﬁnancial year in a stronger 
position than at any time in its history. While the business 
has set itself ambitious targets as we raise the level of 
our investment in digital radio, the potential rewards are 
considerable. Guided by a creative and entrepreneurial 
management team, I am conﬁdent of producing another 
good performance for the year ahead.
I am pleased to report another year of progress for UBC. The 
robust performance of the Group is particularly satisfactory as it 
was delivered in spite of a harsh market for radio advertising for 
much of the year.

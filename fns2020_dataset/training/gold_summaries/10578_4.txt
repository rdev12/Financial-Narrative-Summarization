Division 
Fit Out
The Fit Out division delivered the UK’s largest refurbishment 
in-occupation for PwC at Embankment Place in London 
which achieved a landmark Building Research Establishment 
Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) Outstanding 
score. This complex refurbishment has in fact surpassed all 
other buildings’ BREEAM achievements to date in both new 
build and existing structures.
The ambitious refurbishment programme set out to revitalise 
the dated, lightless and inefficient workspaces while around 
2,000 staff remained in occupation. The end product is a 
modern, multi purpose, intelligent, flexible and collaborative 
workplace that reflects PwC’s market -leading brand position 
by completely transforming the perception, performance 
and reality of the 450,000 sq ft building.

POLYOLEFIN
Lightweight AZOTE
®
 polyolefin block 
foams produced in Croydon, UK, and 
Kentucky, USA. The most common resin 
used is low-density polyethylene. Foams 
are typically produced in dimensions of 2m 
x 1m at various thicknesses and sold to  
a wide variety of applications globally. 
Capacity improvements in UK and a 
significant investment in our Kentucky, 
USA, site to increase global capacity by 
approximately 20%, are aligned with our 
strategic objective to grow sales by twice 
global GDP. Sales in Asia are managed 
through a 50:50 JV company with INOAC 
Corporation of Japan, our largest 
customer in the region.
Revenue
During 2015 Total Revenue from Polyolefin 
foams increased 8%, with a volume 
increase of 10% offset by slightly less 
favourable foreign exchange rates. Sales 
volumes increased in all major markets.
AZOTE
®
There are many grades of AZOTE
®
 
foams, manufactured using varieties of 
polyethylene polymer. These varieties of 
polymer, combined with colour, additives 
to enhance properties such as fire 
resistance, block size and foam density, 
allow the AZOTE
®
 polyolefin foams range 
to be utilised in a hugely diverse range  
of applications.
HPP
High-Performance Products. A portfolio  
of foam products that exhibit certain key 
properties, such as chemical, flammability 
or temperature resistance, due to the 
resins on which they are based. The 
manufacturing process uses the same 
unique, high-pressure nitrogen gas 
process as our AZOTE
®
 range and, 
combined with know-how and our 
increasingly recognisable ZOTEK
®
 
speciality foams brand, offers good 
barriers to entry. 
Revenue
During 2015 Total Revenue in HPP 
increased by 25% and now represents 
15% of Zotefoams’ Group Total Revenue.
ZOTEK
®
ZOTEK
®
 is the brand name for a family of 
HPP block foams. There are a number of 
foam variants manufactured from three 
main categories of polymer. ZOTEK
®
 F 
fluoropolymer foams are made from 
PVDF resin while ZOTEK
®
 N is the brand 
for nylon foams. There is increasing 
interest in our ZOTEK
®
 PEBA range of 
foams for kinetic energy management, 
particularly in the sports industry.
T-FIT
®
 
T-FIT
®
 technical insulation for cleanrooms 
is made from ZOTEK
®
 F blocks although 
we are evaluating extending this product 
range to insulation parts made from 
some of our other foam products. T-FIT 
is currently sold in the pharmaceutical 
and biotech markets, predominantly  
in Asia. 
BLOCK FOAM TECHNOLOGY
At Zotefoams we focus on producing 
high-performance, high quality foams, 
under the brand names AZOTE
®
 and 
ZOTEK
®
, using technologies exclusive to us. 
At the heart of what we do is a unique, 
environmentally friendly, process that 
uses nitrogen gas to produce a range of 
closed cell cross-linked foams. The 
process comprises three distinct stages:
• High quality extrusion and cross-
linking of solid polymeric sheet
• Impregnation of solid sheet with pure 
nitrogen gas at elevated temperature 
and extremely high pressure
• Final expansion of the impregnated 
solid sheet in the low pressure 
autoclave
This technology, as well as being 
environmentally friendly, is extremely 
flexible. Operating at temperatures up to 
250ºC/482ºF allows us to foam a wide 
range of polymers. Some of the unique 
characteristics of Zotefoams’ products 
come from the combination of foaming 
process and polymer performance, 
giving such attributes as very good fire 
resistance, high-temperature stability, 
toughness and insulation.
Regardless of polymer our technology 
produces foam that is:
• uniform • pure
• durable • lightweight
The separation of the process into the 
three distinct stages allows very accurate 
control of the individual parameters 
governing consistent production of 
high-quality foams.
MEL
Our MEL business model is to license  
our proprietary technology to customers 
who save on polymer usage when 
manufacturing their products. A proportion 
of this saving is paid to MEL as a royalty 
fee. Licence and royalty fees should 
become the largest income stream for MEL 
when our business is more mature, but 
currently machinery sales, which enable 
customers to use our technology, are the 
largest portion of revenues.
Most of MEL ’s focus is on the packaging 
market, where polymer usage is high and 
there is a high degree of commonality 
between potential customers. Our MuCell
®
 
microcellular foaming technology is 
currently used in bottles, sheet and film 
products globally.
Revenue
Total Revenue from MEL increased by 25% 
in 2015 driven by an increase in machinery 
sales and favourable foreign exchange 
rates. In 2015 MEL accounted for 5% of 
the Zotefoams Group Total Revenue.
MUCELL
® 
TECHNOLOGY
MuCell
®
 technology is a remarkable 
patented process that creates ‘micro-
bubbles’ in the core of plastic parts or 
products by injecting gas into them as 
they are manufactured. 
This produces a foamed core bounded 
by a solid skin as one integral material 
that seems indistinguishable from  
a solid product.
A MuCell
®
 extruded part or product can 
be designed to perform like solid plastic, 
but will typically use 15-20% less 
material. These cost and environmental 
benefits are delivered by using inert 
carbon dioxide or nitrogen gas, reducing 
plastic content at source.

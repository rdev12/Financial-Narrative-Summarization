Reported revenues from continuing

continuing operations of £0.8m 
(2014: £7.7m), with profit of £6.1m

Sale of Kurt Salmon business in France 
and related geographies was completed 
on 7 January 2016, the Group receiving 
gross proceeds at completion of 
approximately £65.9m
Loss from discontinued operations 
of £57.8m (2014: £1.1m profit)

“MCG has completed the sale of the French and related operations of Kurt Salmon 
and we have repaid the Group’s bank debt. The Group is in a strong financial 
position, debt free, and well placed to promote profitable growth in its continuing 
operations. Alexander Proudfoot had a very disappointing 2015 and continues 
to be significantly affected by weaker demand from natural resources clients. 
Kurt Salmon is now primarily focused on the global retail and consumer goods 
practice, together with a US healthcare practice. The Board of MCG will remain alert 
to all opportunities to generate value from the Group’s portfolio of businesses.”
Nick Stagg Chief Executive

 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 06
We are disappointed to report a set of results 
for the Group for the year which are below our 
expectations at the start of 2013, although 
they do not truly represent the substantial 
improvements that have been made this year. 
We do believe we have made good progress 
and are laying good foundations to make further 
progress in the years ahead.
We started the year with some challenging, 
and over optimistic goals and objectives, and 
immediately met some head winds that blew 
us off course. Illness, macro-economic and 
market factors, growth pains from the merger 
of several businesses, and the loss of key 
staff all contributed to a slow start to the year. 
The recovery has been challenging alongside 
addressing a number of issues in the business, 
but the strong second half performance attests 
to resolving those issues.
The PSS division started the year slowly but 
gathered momentum throughout the period 
resulting in our most successful year yet in 
market share gains with over 108 new systems 
(2012: 76) won in the year. The challenge in 
2013 which depressed revenues, came from the 
change in mix away from software purchases to 
more managed and hosted solutions. Although 
signed order value was 69% up on the previous 
year, recognisable revenue is only marginally 
up. The division ended the year with over 90% 
market share in its core target markets and with 
encouraging wins in other local government 
departments where we have been asked to assist 
in delivering improved services at lower cost. 
This year has seen the division begin to expand 
into overseas territories, winning its first frame 
work agreement for elections in Norway and 
supplying to 30% of the Norwegian market. 2014 
will see further investment to sow the seeds for 
overseas expansion in 2015. The division has 
continued to improve its operational efficiency 
as well as successfully deliver all its services on 
time, thus building on our goal to be the partner 
of choice for local government.
The EIM division had a challenging year. The 
31% growth in revenues in 2012 which added 
size and complexity to the business, the roll-
out of large contracts, the addition of two 
acquisitions, and the impact of large macro-
economic factors deferring decisions in the 
customer base, caused a few problems which 
it has taken time to respond to. The expected 
growth in Asia and the execution of large 
enterprise deals were delayed due to customer 
nervousness around economic factors and a 
focus to improve return on existing assets, rather 
than to invest in the future. The integration of 
our acquisitions have proven challenging both in 
cultural fit and language issues, but this is close 
to being behind us. We started the year looking 
to strengthen the management team and this 
has taken the whole year to achieve with new 
management in professional services, and the 
appointment of a new divisional CEO. 
In spite of all of this the division still managed to 
introduce new mobile Apps, web-based enquiry 
tools, communication and interoperability 
interfaces between the various systems, 
“ We started the year  
with some challenging,  
and over optimistic goals 
and objectives…”

internationalisation of the products, Building 
Information Management (BIM) compliance 
for Architectural Engineering and Construction 
(AEC) customers, integrated document and 
facilities management, as well as upgrades 
to the customer interfaces, and to broaden 
the ability of the systems to extend from feed, 
design, deliverables, into operations with the 
acquisition of Artesys. Artesys is also close 
to delivering an upgrade to their solution in 
collaboration with Documentum using their D2 
platform. New contract wins were disappointing 
as they were in line with the previous year’s 
activity levels, excluding last year’s two large 
enterprise sales wins.
McLaren also launched its first BPO service in 
the year and it has subsequently expanded this 
by the year end.
The Information Solutions division was merged 
into the PSS division to streamline the business 
and drive further operating efficiencies. Its 
project work continued to be adversely affected 
by government cut backs and it did not manage 
to increase its managed content service 
revenues. The Dutch business grew market 
share but this was offset by the reduction in  
the Dutch government grant rate. 
Outlook 
The focus for 2014 and beyond is on  
improving organic growth, operational 
improvement and innovation. 
We will continue to concentrate on growing top 
line revenue in both parts of the business which 
is now refocused on our two core activities, and 
look to expand our public sector business into 
new areas both in the UK and overseas. We also 
expect to close a large proportion of the EIM 
pipeline deals, now we have bolstered the senior 
management team and improved the way we 
respond to our customers’ requirements.
Our aim is to continue to grow our non UK 
revenues and to invest to strengthen our domain 
specific expertise in our chosen markets.
We believe the Group is well placed to benefit 
from an improving economic outlook and today 
has the technical capability to deliver unique 
solutions to its customers and future proof their 
investment and commitment in Idox’s solutions. 
Financial Review
Group revenues from continuing operations 
grew by 3% to £57m (2012: £55m) due to 
organic growth in the PSS division and the 
impact of the three acquisitions made during 
2012. The Group maintained the geographical 
split of its revenues with 33% generated outside 
of the UK (2012: 33%). Gross profit earned 
was 4% higher at £52m (2012: £50m) and the 
Group saw an increase in gross margin from 
90% to 91% as a result of an increased mix 
of higher margin software business. Earnings 
before goodwill, amortisation, depreciation, 
restructuring, acquisition and share option 
costs (“Adjusted EBITDA”) decreased by 9% to 
£15m (2012: £16.6m) with EBITDA margins of 
26% (2012: 30%).
Performance by segment
The Group made a significant step forward to 
increase the focus of the business with the sale of 
its recruitment business at the half year. Following 
the disposal, the Group has been reorganised 
into two operating segments; Public Sector 
Software, the merger of the original public sector 
business and Information Solutions divisions, and 
Engineering Information Management.
The PSS division, which accounted for 66% of 
Group revenues (2012: 68%), delivered revenues 
of £38m (2012: £37.6m). Product and services 
revenue grew organically by 10% on the previous 
year. Election revenue remained stable at £2.4m, 
reflecting a real decrease from 2012. It benefited 
from the full year impact of the acquisition of 
Opt2Vote election managed services business in 
March 2012, and the expansion of that business 
into Norway, but this was offset by the absence 
of revenue from fewer local elections in 2013. 
Solutions project income fell by 54% (£0.4m) due 
to a lack of tenders in poor market conditions. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 08
Recurring revenues within the PSS division were 
61% (2012: 62%) excluding election revenue. 
The decrease in recurring revenues is due to the 
wind down of the capital value of the managed 
service contracts acquired in March 2010 for 
the provision of land and property information 
solutions. Renewal rates on grant subscriptions 
performed well in poor market conditions and 
remained consistent with prior years. Divisional 
Adjusted EBITDA fell by 5% to £10.6m (2012: 
£11.3m), delivering a 28% margin, a 2% drop 
on 2012 due to the inclusion of the lower gross 
margin e-learning and solutions training and 
information projects business. 
The EIM division accounted for 34% of Group 
revenues (2012: 32%) and had revenue growth 
of 8% to £19.2m (2012: £17.7m). This growth 
represents a full year of FMx and seven months 
of Artesys acquired on 9 April 2013. Visibility of 
revenue in the EIM business has also increased 
during the year with 51% (2012: 48%) of 
revenues coming from recurring maintenance 
and Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) contracts. 
The business is also becoming increasingly 
international within 76% of revenues generated 
outside the UK; 46% USA, 22% Europe and 
Asia, and 8% from Australia.
EBITDA for the EIM business decreased to 
£4.4m (2012: £5.3m), 29% of the Group total. 
The decrease represents the reduction in licence 
deals in comparison to 2012 offset by additional 
contributions from FMx and Artesys plus cost 
synergies. Margins decreased to 23% (2012: 
30%) reflecting the absence of organic growth 
on licence sales and the impact of integration 
costs relating to the acquired businesses. 
Profit before tax
Within the income statement, we present both 
profit before tax and adjusted profit before tax 
which is a performance measure that is not 
defined by GAAP but which the directors believe 
provides a reliable and consistent measure of 
the Group’s underlying financial performance. 
Adjusted profit before tax and adjusted EPS 
excludes amortisation, restructuring, acquisition 
and share option costs. 
Adjusted profit before tax decreased 10% to 
£13.2m (2012: £14.8m). Staff costs increased by 
8% to £28m (2012: £26m). The £2.5m increase 
in staff costs was due to 12 months of the 2012 
acquisitions and 7 months of Artesys. Real 
staff costs fell as a result of cost savings. Other 
administrative expenses increased by 18% to 
£8.9m (2012: £7.5m). 48% of the increase was 
due to a full year of acquisitions and the new 
acquisition in 2013. Travel costs increased due 
to increased revenues in new territories with the 
elections and EIM businesses.
Financing costs reduced from £1.3m to £1.2m 
and includes interest payable of £0.9m (2012: 
£0.9m) and amortisation of the loan facility fees 
of £0.16m (2012: £0.2m). 
Reported profit before tax decreased by 5% to 
£7.5m (2012: £7.9m). Amortisation of intangibles 
increased from £4.6m to £5.3m as a result of 
acquisitions made during the year and a full year 
of 2012 acquisitions. Restructuring charges of 
£0.5m (2012: £0.4m) relate to the integration of 
acquisitions made during the year plus internal 
reorganisations. There was a one off benefit of 
£0.8m included in acquisition costs related to the 
release of earn-out obligations on the Opt2Vote 
acquisition which did not become payable. 
Excluding this £0.8m benefit acquisition costs 
reduced to £0.2m (2012: £1.1m) representing 
£0.64m acquisition costs for Artesys and other 
aborted acquisition fees.

The Group continues to invest in developing 
innovative technology solutions and has 
incurred capitalised Research and Development 
costs of £1.3m (2012: £0.8m). Research and 
development costs expensed in the year were 
£3.8m (2012: £3.2m).
Taxation
The Group’s effective tax rate for the year 
was -12.75% compared to 3% in 2012. The 
reduction in the effective rate of tax is the result 
of recognition of a deferred tax asset in relation 
to previously unrecognised losses within the 
EIM business and recognition of a deferred tax 
asset in respect of share options. Excluding the 
effect of recognising the deferred tax asset the 
effective tax rate was 13%. Unrelieved trading 
losses of £2,652,000 in the UK remain available 
to offset against future taxable trading profits. 
Unrelieved trading losses arising overseas of 
£3,286,000 have been recognised during the 
year. The board believe the Group will benefit 
from these tax losses in the future.
Earnings per share and dividends
Adjusted earnings per share fell 8% to 3.53p 
(2012: 3.83p). Diluted adjusted earnings per 
share fell 7% to 3.38p (2012: 3.63p). 
Basic earnings per share were up 12% to 
2.17p (2012: 1.94p). Diluted earnings per share 
increased by 13% to 2.07p (2012: 1.84p). 
The Board proposes a final dividend of 0.4p, to 
give a full year dividend of 0.7p (2012: 0.675p). 
Subject to approval at the Annual General 
Meeting, the final dividend will be paid on 
25 April 2014 to shareholders on the register  
at 11 April 2014. 
Balance sheet and cashflows
Idox’s balance sheet continued to strengthen 
during the year and at 31 October 2013 net 
assets were £44.7m compared to £38.9m at 
31 October 2012. 
Cash generated from operating activities before 
tax as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA was 
79%, up from 75% in the previous year. 
The Group ended the year with net debt of 
£19.8m (2012: £21.5m) after making acquisition 
related payments (net of cash acquired) of £1.8m 
and after total dividends of £2.4m. The Group’s 
total signed debt facilities at 31 October 2013 
stood at £30.4m, a combination of a term loan 
and flexible working capital and acquisition 
revolving credit facilities. The working capital 
facility of £8m is due to expire during the next 
12 months, however this is expected to be 
renegotiated with the bank on similar terms; the 
Company have not sought written confirmation 
that the facility will be renewed. The board has 
considered the headroom in the bank facilities 
and are comfortable that unless there was 
a substantial deterioration in trading, Group 
budgets do not indicate any covenant breaches 
on the bank facilities currently in place.
Deferred income, representing invoiced 
maintenance and SaaS contracts yet to be 
recognised in revenue stood at £13.9m at 
31 October 2013 (2012: £13.5m), increasing 
visibility of revenue in the new financial year.

Chariot is entering a new phase of 
development with the initiation of its 
drilling campaign whilst continuing to 
develop its portfolio and balance risk. 
Chariot at a glance
Our strategy  
and goals
Chariot’s key focus is to develop its current 
assets through to production, while 
seeking further farm-out agreements and 
introducing other opportunities to the 
portfolio – minimising risk and maximising 
value to shareholders. This can be 
summarised in four points:
PGS farmed into the Central Blocks for a 10% 
interest, in exchange for covering the costs of 50% 
of 3,500km² of a 3D seismic survey (August 2011) 
which was carried out and completed in 
February 2012. Resource update is anticipated 
once the data is interpreted H2 2012.

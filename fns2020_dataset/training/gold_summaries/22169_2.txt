Our Purpose
Delivering innovative social care on behalf 
of local authority and health service 
commissioners throughout the UK, 
CareTech has a long established reputation 
as a provider of high quality and safe 
services. CareTech offers a comprehensive 
outsourcing service to commissioners with 
the experience and commitment to provide 
exactly what is required.
Focusing on the high acuity social care 
population we support children and adults 
through solutions that are both individual 
and tailor made to each of our service users.
Our core services provide for people with 
learning disabilities, individuals who have or 
are recovering from mental illness, people 
with autistic spectrum disorder, people who 
have one or more physical impairments and 
provide care and rehabilitation for men with 
acquired brain injury (“ABI”). We deliver 
support through residential services and a 
wide choice of creative home-based 
options.
Our Children Services cover assessment, 
residential care, education and fostering 
options, including specialist provision for 
very complex young people. We carefully 
and professionally support any child 
irrespective of their reasons for being in 
public care. We can provide the right 
solution for complex and difficult situations 
through our nationally recognised expertise 
in provision for children and young people 
who present with sexually offending 
behaviours or who have emotional and 
behavioural disorders. Our comprehensive 
service includes education in Ofsted 
registered schools of very high quality.
CareTech pioneered transition services for 
young people leaving care and for adults 
who are making the move into their own 
home after a lifetime in residential or 
institutional settings. We remain a national 
leader in the drive to enable people to live 
in a home of their own.
We believe in opportunity and have 
developed an enviable reputation as a 
leading provider and organiser of modern 
apprenticeships within exciting projects 
across the UK.

Our people
Key to the successful operation of
our pubs is our ability to recruit, train
and retain the best people. We offer
comprehensive training, so
experience is not essential; however
personality and a passion for
customer service are critical.

Value and volume strategy
Our operational strategy is to focus
on value and volume: improving the
value we offer our customers leads 
to higher volumes and improved
productivity. These gains, along with
better purchasing terms, enable us 
to reduce costs and then reinvest 
the margin gains in further quality 
and value.

Residential
The majority of our pubs have prime
locations in residential areas and are
therefore well positioned to take
advantage of the growth in eating-out as
well as increasing our drinks market share.

Positioned for success
With 3% of the pubs in the UK, we have 
a 10% share of pub market sales. This 
has been achieved through a strategic
positioning of the estate to attractive 
areas of the market, which has driven 
our growth, particularly in food.

Growth and investment
We have invested a total of £253m in our
pubs over the year. This has enabled us
to develop, evolve and maintain our high
quality estate, with significant returns on
investment, whilst further improving our
relative value proposition in light of the
under-investment in the overall on-trade
pub market.

Our market
The pub market is estimated to be worth
over £19bn per annum. It has benefited
over the last ten years from the growth
in the popularity of eating-out, with
approximately a third of total household
food expenditure now made outside the
home. This is in contrast to the more
traditional pub market of draught beer,
which has declined, down 27% in
volume since 1998.
Against this background, our strategy
has proved exceptionally successful,
driving market share gains in all key
categories.

 Introduction
I am very pleased to report another
year of solid growth and progress 
in financial results.
The sterling translation of Stadium
Asia sales show growth year over
year of 14%, which equates to 23%
expressed in local currency. This
excellent performance results from
a very strong team effort, with a
high conversion rate of enquiries
into sales. The plant at Dongguan 
has benefited from further
investment, and is of a very high
standard.
Our UK electronics factories 
at Hartlepool and Diss continue to
provide an important development
and engineering platform for our
customers, together with production
capabilities for those products
better suited to UK manufacture.
Our Branded Plastics business 
did well in competitive market
conditions, and a number of new
products have been introduced
successfully.
Results
Profit before taxation was £2.01m
(2003: £1.86m), an increase of 8%.
Profit before taxation, goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items
increased by 24% to £2.34m 
(2003: £1.88m).
Borrowings at the year end were
broadly unchanged at £1.58m 
(2003: £1.59m) with an 
improvement in gearing to 11.4%
(2003: 12.0%).
These results have been achieved 
in spite of further weakening of the
US Dollar, which had an adverse
impact on the translation of earnings
from Stadium Asia of 11% at
average exchange rates.
Shareholders
We continue to attract greater
interest as a growth investment 
and this has been reflected in the
positive share price movement
during the year.
Last year, we indicated our intention
to return to a progressive dividend
policy. Following the increase last
year, and in view of the strong
increase in earnings, I am pleased
to announce a final dividend to be
paid on 3 May 2005 of 2.25 pence
per ordinary share, bringing the total
for the year to 3.25 pence; an
increase of 12% (2003: 2.9p)
Employees
I would like to thank the directors
and staff in the UK and overseas.
Their tremendous effort in meeting
the demands of our customers, and
their great commitment to the
company is reflected in our
performance.
Board changes
Professor Kevin Morley announced
last year his intention to resign from
the board at the AGM in 2005.
Kevin joined the board at flotation 
in 1996, and during his nine years
on the board his commercial
experience and judgement have
contributed greatly to the
development of strategy, including
the increasing international flavour
of our manufacturing base. I wish to
thank Kevin for all he has done for
the company, and for his support.
We will all miss his fellowship and
wonderful sense of humour.
On 17 February 2005, we
announced that Nick Brayshaw 
is joining the board as Senior
Independent Director on 27 April
2005. Nick joins the board with an
excellent background in engineering,
and with considerable experience in
manufacturing and sales. We are
delighted to have a director of his
calibre join the board, and believe
that he will make a significant
contribution to future development.

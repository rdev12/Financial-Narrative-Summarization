KBC continued its long‑ term engagements for 
all software and service offerings by providing

industry expertise – critical to the safe and 
reliable operation of their facilities – while also

KBC continues to pursue opportunities in 
the FSU given the refining sector will undergo 
significant expansion in the future but we 
approach this region cautiously with close 
attention to current constraints in this 
market sector.

KBC was engaged by a national oil company 
in South East Asia to lead the content and 
delivery of an Operational Excellence 
Academy (OEA) programme. The OEA 
programme was designed around best

focused on developing plant leaders with 
technical functional leadership capabilities to 
effectively drive operational excellence and 
sustain performance. The OEA programme 
has been rolled out to cover downstream 
operations with an initial contract value at 
over US$3m.

“...the Group achieved further increases in completions, improved margins and
underlying pre-tax profits, our 14th consecutive year of growth”
Hampton Court Mews, East Molesey, Greater London. A select

sought-after riverside village on the outskirts of London.  5
I am again pleased to report that, despite a competitive
market place, the Group achieved further increases in
completions, improved margins and produced pre–tax
profits of £391.4m.  This was our 14th consecutive year of
organic growth.  
The main features of the results for the year ended 30th
June 2006, with comparison to the same period last year
and prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRS), are as follows:-
• Underlying pre-tax profit, excluding a £15.9m one–off
profit from the disposal of freehold ground rents in 2005,
increased by 3.4% from £378.4m to £391.4m.  Profit
before tax was £391.4m compared to £394.3m in 2005.
• Adjusted basic earnings per share, (excluding £11.1m
profit after tax from the freehold ground rent disposal in
2005) increased from 115.2p to 115.3p. Basic earnings
per share amounted to 115.3p against 119.9p.
• A final dividend of 20.69 pence per share will be
recommended, payable on 29 November 2006 to
shareholders on the register on 3 November 2006,
against 17.99 pence the previous year.  This gives a total
dividend for the year of 31.03 pence, an increase of
15%, 3.7 times covered.  This increase reflects our
progress and the Board’s confidence in the future
performance of the Group.
• Net cash at the year end was £34.9m (2005: £276.9m)
with average gearing over the year of 11%.  This was
achieved notwithstanding a £253.3m increase in
investment in land and work in progress.
• Return on average capital employed continued to be
amongst the highest in the industry at 27% (2005:
31%).  
These encouraging results once again demonstrate the
continued success of our growth strategy and the
fundamental strengths of the Group.
The medium and long term fundamentals of the housing
market remain sound, reinforced by a continuing serious
shortage of new homes resulting from the very slow planning
system.  We remain confident that we can continue to grow
the business and create value for our shareholders.
Once again, our experienced management team across the
Group has shown its ability to succeed in a competitive
market place.   I would like to thank all of our people
throughout the Group for all their hard work.  Our continued
success is a result of their teamwork, skills and
commitment.
There have been a number of Board changes this year.
Group Finance Director, Colin Dearlove and Deputy Chief
Executive, Harold Walker both retired on 30 June 2006 after
many exemplary years of service with the Group.  
Mark Pain was appointed an Executive Director on 1 March
2006 and assumed executive responsibility as Group
Finance Director on 1 July 2006.  In addition, on 1 May
2006 we appointed Rod MacEachrane, formerly Commercial
Director of the NHBC, as a Non-Executive Director.
Our Chief Executive, David Pretty, retires at Christmas after
27 years with the Group. David has given outstanding
service to the company at all levels, including 16 years as a
main Board Director and 4 years as Chief Executive. Under
his leadership we have achieved a strengthened land bank
and successive years of record growth in volumes and
profits. He leaves the business well placed for the future and
we wish him a long, happy and well-deserved retirement.
Mark Clare will join us to take over as Chief Executive on 2
October 2006 with David remaining on the Board for a
further three months to ensure an orderly transition.
Looking ahead, we are well placed to continue to progress.
Our wide geographic spread and extensive product range,
together with our urban regeneration and social housing
expertise, all contributed to another good result for the year.
These core strengths, together with our experienced
management team, healthy forward sales, strengthened land
bank and strong finances leave us well positioned for the
future.

Barratt Developments PLC.

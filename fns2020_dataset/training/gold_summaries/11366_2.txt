WHO WE ARE
Nostrum Oil & Gas is a multi-field 
E&P partnership operating in 
north-west Kazakhstan. Our main 
producing asset is the Chinarevskoye 
field located in the northern part  
of the oil-rich pre-Caspian Basin. 
Other assets currently include the 
Rostoshinskoye, Darzhinskoye and 
Yuzhno-Gremyachenskoye fields, 
which are all located in the vicinity  
of the Chinarevskoye field and  
its gas treatment facility (GTF). 
Nostrum has 582 million of 2P 
reserves and has produced over  
16 million barrels of oil equivalent 
during 2013. 
WHAt WE d O
Nostrum Oil & Gas focuses on creating long-term 
shareholder value through the development and discovery 
of oil and gas reserves, as well as the production and sale  
of crude oil, stabilised condensate, LPG and dry gas. We 
have invested over US$1.5 billion in our licence area since 
2004. We have a highly skilled management team, which 
has delivered on numerous infrastructure projects as well  
as significant expansion of the reserve base over the last  
nine years. This expansion is the result of our own appraisal 
work, as well as successful M&A.
Our commercial products
Nostrum’s range of products includes crude oil,  
stabilised liquid condensate, LPG and dry gas. Currently  
all production comes from the Chinarevskoye licence.  
We have invested in developing our own infrastructure to 
control the transportation of our products until they reach 
the final off-taker. This transport serves a wide network of 
destinations and off-takers ensuring we always obtain the 
best possible prices. 
The change of name to Nostrum Oil & Gas during  
2013 reflects the development of the Partnership into  
a multi-asset operation. In addition, it is part of our  
strategy to continue to expand our portfolio of assets 
beyond our current four fields.

The current production from the Chinarevskoye licence 
only represents half of what we are aiming to achieve  
from the field. We are currently working to increase our 
processing capacity, allowing us to double production  
by the end of 2016.

RESERv ES
An update of Nostrum’s reserves report was completed  
by Ryder Scott in December 2013. This report includes  
the reserves at Chinarevskoye and the three additional 
licence areas acquired in 2013. An overview of the  
reserves is provided below.
1P: The Proven reserve base grew from 195 mboe as  
of 31 December 2012 to 199 mboe. Taking into account 
approximately 16 mboe of production during 2013, 
Nostrum enjoyed a reserve replacement ratio of 102%.
2P: Total 2P (Proven and Probable) reserves increased by 
75 mboe to 582 mboe from 31 December 2012. The new 
licence areas account for 98 mboe of the total 2P reserves. 
The total Chinarevskoye 2P reserves were 483 mboe.
3P: Total 3P reserves were 691 mboe, of which 76 mboe  
are located in the Chinarevskoye field and 34 mboe in  
the new licence areas. This represents a decrease from  
the previous 3P estimate carried out in 2009, due to a 
combination of reserves moving into higher categories, 
cumulative production over the period and the additional 
information built over the last four years. This allows for 
more accurate 2P reserves to be calculated and removes 
the possible reserves which are now considered unlikely  
to be suitable for commercial production.

Market positioning

The Company’s front-loaded investment programme has 
meant it is now a leader in terms of infrastructure in the 
region, with the ability to process significant volumes of raw 
gas via its gas treatment plant. In addition, its advantageous 
location in north-west Kazakhstan places it closer to its final 
off-take destinations.

 Chairman’s statement
I am pleased to present to shareholders our first annual report and accounts as an AIM
listed company.  
The Group has delivered another outstanding set of financial results, with operating profit
growing by 114 per cent as a result of a combination of acquisitions, organic growth and
efficiency improvements. 2006-07 was our seventh consecutive year of profitable growth
since incorporation.
Our strategy of building a focused and integrated group under a single brand through
selected acquisitions and organic growth continues to pay off. The results reflect both
earnings-enhancing additions to our operations and the benefits of cross-selling, combined
selling and efficiency gains from integration. Above all, they reflect the continued success
of our entrepreneurial approach to meeting the needs of our markets.
Results
T urnover for the year was £6.54 million (2006: £4.12 million), an increase of 59 per cent
over the prior year as a result of organic growth of 7.7 per cent, a full year’s trading from
the four businesses acquired in 2005/06 and six months contribution from Attenborough
Saffron acquired in February 2007. Revenue (gross profit) increased by 65 per cent to
£4.66 million (2006: £2.82 million). Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation were £1.14 million (2006: £0.58 million). Operating profit margins as a
percentage of revenue increased to 21.8 per cent (2006: 16.9 per cent). Profit before
taxation increased by 111 per cent to £0.92 million (2006: £0.44 million).
Basic earnings per share were 9.66p (2006: 6.10p), an increase of 58 per cent and fully
diluted earnings per share rose by 55 per cent to 9.48p (2006: 6.10p). 
We continue to see strong cash generation by the Group, with net cash flow from
operating activities of £0.81m in the year (2006: £0.60m). This coupled with our other
available funds, makes us well placed to finance growth going forward.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 1.5145p taking the total to 2.98p for the
year, an increase of 22 per cent on the prior year. This is in line with our progressive
dividend policy, and the dividend was covered 2.5 times by earnings. The dividend will be
paid on 10 January 2008 to shareholders on the register on 14 December 2007. 
Financing
On behalf of the Board, I would like to welcome the new investors who showed
confidence in Freshwater’s strategy by supporting the placing which raised £4m before
expenses as part of the Group’s admission to AIM on 16 July 2007. I would also like to
thank those who invested in our final fund-raising as a private company, which raised
£0.44m in January-February 2007 taking the total equity investment prior to joining AIM
to £2.2m.
On top of the aggregate £6.2m in equity investment, we have also negotiated a £2.2m
banking facility with Royal Bank of Scotland.

Board and Employees
I took over the chair midway through the year from David Howell, who held the post for
three years and helped steer the Group through a period of very rapid growth, including
seven acquisitions.  David continues on the Board as a non-executive director. 
Ken Tilley, our vice chairman and also a non-executive director, intends to step down from
the Board at the Annual General Meeting on 24 January 2008. The Board would like 
to take this opportunity to express our appreciation to him for his contribution over 
the last five years.  He will continue to be involved as Company Secretary with effect from
the AGM.  
Baroness Cohen of Pimlico, also a non-executive director of the London Stock Exchange
plc, was appointed to the Board on 1 June 2007 and now chairs our Audit Committee. 
Following the acquisition of Leeds-based Lynx Public Relations on 1 November 2007 and
of Waterfront Public Affairs and the Waterfront Conference Company on 2 December
2007, the Group now employs 118 people all of whom are contributing to the
implementation of our strategy.  
The Board is committed to ensuring they share in the Group’s success through our
progressive approach to rewards including share options, bonuses, pensions and salaries.
Outlook
Since 31 August 2007, we have been trading in line with expectations, and the two latest
acquisitions - Lynx and Waterfront - have added further regional and specialist strength to
the Group.
While we are aware of the potential threats to global economic growth, we are still
experiencing robust market conditions  and  we have an excellent spread in terms of both
business offering and client base, making the Group resilient to the impact of any slow
downs that may occur in the economy. As a result, we are confident of the prospects of
the Group and of making further progress in the year to 31 August 2008.

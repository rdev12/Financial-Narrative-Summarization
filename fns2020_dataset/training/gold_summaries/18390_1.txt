 Chief Executive Officer’s introduction
We are not just in the business of changing 
technology, we’re also in the business of 
changing the culture of healthcare.
 Q What were the highlights of 2015?
There were so many, but to name a few:
Primary care completed the EMIS Web 
roll-out in England and Wales and got ready 
for implementation in Northern Ireland. 
Child, Community and Mental Health (CCMH) 
had many contract wins, increasing its 
market share well beyond our target of 10%. 
We also made real progress in integrating 
primary and community care. For example, 
EMIS Health is now the sole provider 
of primary and community care in nearly 
12% of English Clinical Commissioning 
Groups (CCGs) and over 14% of Scottish 
Health Boards. Patient moved to the .info 
top-level domain, extending its international 
reach, and continuing to help millions of 
patients to have access to their own medical 
records anytime anywhere. Egton supported 
both our Group and customers in a myriad 
of ways. Community pharmacy worked 
behind the scenes on a very lengthy and 
complex procurement that has now reached 
a successful agreement and will make it 
the dispensary management market leader, 
both in terms of product penetration and 
market share. It also secured funding from its 
ﬁrst CCG to closely connect pharmacies with 
primary care. In Secondary care 
an all new management team laid down 
ﬁrm foundations for further growth in 
acute settings, links between urgent and 
emergency care, and moved into new 
premises where everyone could work 
together rather than in physical silos. Finally, 
Specialist care successfully retendered a 
number of its English diabetic retinopathy 
screening services, helping keep millions 
suffering from diabetes safe from blindness 
until 2020 and beyond.

 Q&A
 Q Why rebrand?
EMIS Group has grown signiﬁcantly over 
the past few years. We now work in every 
major healthcare setting from primary care 
and community pharmacy, to community, 
mental health, secondary and specialist 
care. We wanted to simplify the message 
for our customers and other stakeholders, 
and align ourselves to our customers’ needs 
by focusing on integrated care and joining 
up working between all health sectors.
Patient is targeted at patients and 
citizens. With many millions of visitors a 
month, it’s an internationally recognised 
and respected brand that resonates with 
its audiences. Having rebranded as Patient 
at the beginning of June and changed the 
website address to www.patient.info, it is 
perfectly positioned to build its already 
extensive international following.
Egton’s products and services are used by 
the customers of several of our divisions, 
as well as those of our competitors in the 
healthcare market. Egton’s products are 
also used by the legal, education and retail 
sectors. For this reason, we have retained 
it as a separate brand to support its growth 
in all sectors.
Medical Imaging is to be rebranded 
to become EMIS Care, and is the most 
experienced private company in the UK 
in providing ophthalmic imaging services 
to NHS Trusts.

Working more 
productively
 Q  What are the challenges in the 
market and how can you help? 
Funding pressures are expected to be 
pronounced in the NHS, with NHS England’s 
‘Five Year Forward View’ suggesting that 
its £30bn funding challenge will be met by 
£22bn of NHS savings and £8bn of additional 
funding. As a consequence, NHS providers 
desperately need to update their technology 
to help staff work more productively. 
So whether building our own solutions, 
partnering with the best in the world or 
growing through acquisition the Group is 
increasingly able to help the NHS deliver 
integrated care through joined up systems.
EMIS Group is well positioned to deliver 
the integrated technology offering that 
NHS Trusts increasingly seek. We are also 
well placed to support CCGs in delivering 
health and social care integration as we 
not only support NHS commissioners 
but also work with local authorities.
Working with all our key stakeholders to 
join up products including major initiatives 
between primary and secondary care 
(especially in urgent care) and also between 
community pharmacy and primary care will 
continue to be a key focus for us in 2016.
Markets P10
 Q What other opportunities are there?
For clinicians and care professionals, 
being able to offer a 21st century service to 
patients and clients means having access 
to all, but only, the appropriate information, 
from across health and social care services. 
Technology and data helps to improve the 
quality of services available to all of us.
Interoperability has always been 
important to EMIS Group. EMIS Health 
has become the ﬁrst UK clinical systems 
provider to implement new open standards 
for interoperability in the NHS – enabling 
clinicians using its systems to securely 
share data with any other third party 
system across health and social care. 
This milestone puts in place a solid 
foundation for EMIS Health to rapidly 
evolve innovative interoperable services. 
Initially, third party systems will be able 
to securely obtain real-time primary care 
patient information, subject to tight 
information governance controls.
There are opportunities for growth 
particularly in the traditional community, 
pharmacy and secondary care markets 
as well as in the gaps between them. 
Following our success in the provision 
of screening for diabetic retinopathy 
we know there are many more people we 
can help. It’s all about preventative care 
– joining up and striving for efficiency. 
Patients and carers also need better access 
to digital services – including access to their 
own records – to take more control of their 
care and to help them manage their own 
health, wellbeing and treatment.

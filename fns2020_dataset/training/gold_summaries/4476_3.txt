 DCD Media’s vertically-integrated structure
takes advantage of the synergies within the
operating divisions optimizing the value of
current and future intellectual property
rights through its distribution arm.
DCD Media has shifted the weight of the
business towards higher-margin production
(now 75% of total revenues) rather than
distribution, to maximize revenues from the
opening up of the market for independent
producers.
The broader base of production and
distribution both spreads risks and creates
business opportunities.
how the structure works
The group sells rights of both DCD and third-party producers
via its wholly owned international distribution arm.  The
division markets not only to television and DVD but also to
emerging new media platforms. DCD also exploits ancillary
rights such as book publishing tie-ins, newspaper spin-off
features, interactive opportunities and advertiser funding.

74578 DCD PRE 1  15/11/07  15:32  Page 4 Letter from our Chairman
During 2006/7 DCD has fulfilled the board’s
expectations in terms of turnover and profit growth, and
shown that our acquisition and consolidation strategy
is soundly based. We are probably now the most broadly
based of all the UK quoted independent TV companies,
we have an exciting creative core and a strengthened
management team, who together make DCD Media a
key player in the TV production and distribution sector .
The current trading year should show further progress,
with the latest acquisitions bearing fruit.   
On behalf of the board, I am pleased to present the
annual results for the group for the year ended
June 30 2007.
During this financial year, DCD Media has set itself
two key targets: integration of the acquisitions
made in the previous year and preparation for
further enlargement of the group within a rapidly
consolidating sector.
Turnover in 2006/7 was more than double the
previous year, which in turn had seen a significant
increase on 2004/5. What was until recently a
£3.1m per annum turnover company is now a £26.8m
turnover company, and this is before any contribution
from the acquisitions made in the summer .
Each of the production entities within the
group has made significant contributions to
our outcome, and the distribution division has
capitalized on the availability of dramas delivered
by Box, such as The Wind In The Willows, 
Bon Voyage and The Last Enemy, as well as
documentaries from Iambic on Abba, The Beatles
and Boy Bands. Done and Dusted, which
specializes in filming live events, is also
generating opportunities for the distribution
division, with programmes such as T4 on the
Beach. The results reported here embrace the
results of Iambic, Done and Dusted, Box, our 
DVD label and the distribution specialist NBD TV.
Financial Review
With turnover doubling (from £13.3m in 2005/6
to £26.8m in 2006/7), the various measures of
profit reflected the enlarged scale of the business.
Gross profit increased from £3.1m (2005/6) to
£5.8m (2006/7), operating profit from a loss of
£1.0m (2005/6) to a positive figure of £0.4m before
an exceptional item, and adjusted profit before tax
from a loss of £0.3m (2005/6) to a profit of £1.36m
(2006/7). This outcome demonstrates our ability to
absorb new businesses, and encourages us to
continue on this track.
There were a number of one-off costs during
the year, such as moving all operating companies
into one office in order to rationalise the group.
This was also a period when we took a full year of
goodwill amortization from previous acquisitions
(£1.2m charge, compared with £0.7m in the
previous year).
Outlook
As the core of production entities within the
group enlarges, so the benefits of shared
overheads and creative synergy come to the fore.
Further acquisitions, made during August 2007
and described below, will accentuate these trends,
and place DCD Media firmly in the front rank of
listed production and distribution companies.
The UK production industry is a leading player
internationally, and the strategy of steadily
broadening our base whilst carefully controlling
central costs looks increasingly attractive. We
therefore expect to make further progress, on
all key metrics, during the 2007/8 trading year.
I would like to thank all my board colleagues for
their efforts, particularly the executive management
team led by CEO Chris Hunt and CFO John McIntosh.

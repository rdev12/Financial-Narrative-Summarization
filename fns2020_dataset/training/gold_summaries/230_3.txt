December 2006. I am delighted to report 
that the Group has had an extremely 
successful year growing substantially 
both organically and through acquisition. 
In December 2007, we further increased 
our	global	presence	by	opening	an	office	
in India, which complements our Singapore 
and	Chinese	offices.
Results
Our revenue from ship broking 
increased in US Dollar terms by 54% to 
US$39.3 million (2007: US$25.6 million). 
Excluding the effect of the acquisition of 
ACM Shipping Services Limited (ACMSS), 
like for like revenue in Dollars increased 
b y 	 2 2 % 	 o n 	 2 0 0 7 . 	 W e 	 fi x e d 	 a 	 r e c o r d 	 n u m b e r	
of ships and our forward income from 
time charters as at 31 March 2008 is 
at US$24.7 million, up 27% on last year. 
Sale and purchase had an exceptional 
year and the current forward order book 
is valued at US$7.5million. The weakness 
of the US Dollar continued to have an 
adverse effect on our Sterling equivalent 
revenues. Notwithstanding this weakness 
p r o fi t 	 b e f o r e 	 a m o r t i s a t i o n 	 a n d 	 t a x a t i o n 	 w a s	
up 49% to £5.5 million (2007: £3.7 million), 
with adjusted diluted earnings per share 
(at 22.2 pence) up 49% on the preceding 
year. The business has remained extremely 
cash generative. The acquisition cost 
of ACMSS was £9.6 million paid by a mix 
of shares and cash.
Dividend
ACM is committed to a progressive 
dividend policy. The Directors 
are recommending a final dividend 
of 4 pence per share in respect of 
the year to 31 March 2008, making a 
total of 6 pence per share for the year. 
The dividend is payable on 9 October 2008 
to shareholders on the register as at 
12 September 2008.
Employees
Since our inception 26 years ago, the 
Group has developed a very successful 
business with an extensive and loyal 
list of clients. It has been particularly 
encouraging that we have been able 
to expand our teams with a number of 
well‑known senior brokers in the industry. 
We look forward to continuing to build 
on this strong platform. It is appropriate 
to extend our thanks to all members 
of our staff for their wholehearted 
commitment to our continued success.
Strategy
ACM’s strategy is to expand into an 
international	diversified	and	integrated	
shipping services provider, whilst 
maintaining its position as one of 
the	most	profitable	firms	in	the	tank er	
broking business. Our aim is to gain 
market share by continuing to build an 
expert team of brokers to penetrate new 
regional markets and other shipping 
sectors in order to grow the business 
with existing and new clients.
Current trading
The start to the current year has been 
encouraging .	F reight	rates	have	been	firm	
and the number of spot deals contracted 
has continued to rise. Despite the world 
economic problems, the prospect for the 
tanker freight market in the near term is 
good as global demand for transporting 
oil continues to be positive. Given the 
strength of our forward order book and 
the new areas ACM are moving into, the 
Board 	 looks 	 to 	 the 	 future 	 with 	 confidence.

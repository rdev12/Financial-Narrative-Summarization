Chairman’s statement
Introduction
The period under review has been a 
d i f fi c u l t 	 o n e 	 f o r 	 A TH . 	 Th e 	 c o n t in u ed 	 im pa c t 	
of the below market price legacy contracts 
combined with much higher input costs, 
principally gas oil, and unexpected 
geological conditions at a number of the 
Gr o u p ’ s 	 s i tes , 	 h a v e 	 a l l 	 c r eated 	 s i g n ifi can t 	
pressure on performance.
D e s p i te	t h e s e	d i f fi c u l t i e s	t h e	G r o u p	
is committed to satisfying legacy 
contract volumes as quickly as possible 
an d	r e m a in s	o n	t r a c k	t o	f u l fi l	t h e	fi r s t	o f	
these contracts by the end of March 2012 
and the second during 2013. The Group 
has also continued to reduce net debt 
and has delivered a further reduction of 
£3.0 million to £31.5 million in the year.
Results in brief
Sales volumes for the year at 1.67 million 
tonnes were slightly lower than last year 
(1.79 million tonnes) but average selling 
p r i c e s	r o s e	b y	1 5 %	t o	£ 5 0 . 4 3	p e r	t o n n e	
( 2 0 1 0 : 	 £ 4 3 . 7 0 	 per 	 t o n n e ) , 	 in c r ea s in g 	 r ev en u e	
t o 	 £ 8 4 . 2 	 m i l l i o n 	 ( 2 0 1 0: 	 £ 7 8 . 3 	 m i l l i o n ) .	
The Group’s legacy sales contracts continue 
to constrain performance and during the 
year accounted for around 32% of total 
sales volumes. Demand for the Group’s 
products remains strong and the Board is 
c o n fi d e n t	o f	b e in g	ab l e	t o	s e l l	a l l	o f	i t s	
annual production. Pre exceptional operating 
p r o fi ts 	 w er e 	 £3 . 0 	 m i l l i o n 	 ( 2 0 1 0 : 	 £7 . 0 	 m i l l i o n ) . 	
However, as it is now apparent that the 
higher input costs, particularly gas oil, 
will feature for some time to come, it was 
necessary to increase the Group’s restoration 
provisions by £1.5 million. Additionally 
t he 	 d i f fi c u l t 	 g e o l o g i c a l 	 c o n d i t i o n s 	 at 	
Glenmuckloch and Muir Dean required a 
write down of the Group’s work in progress 
p r o vi s i o n s 	 o f 	 so m e 	 £ 4 . 1 	 m i l l i o n . 	 Th i s 	 t og et h er	
with other small exceptional charges 
resulted in a pre‑ tax loss of £5.8 million 
( 2 0 1 0 :	p r o fi t	£ 4 . 0	m i l l i o n )	a n d 	 a 	 b a s i c 	 l o s s	
per share from continuing operations of 
11.5 pence (2010: earnings of 6.3 pence). 
Dividend
Given the impact of the legacy contracts 
and the level of exceptional charges this 
year, the Board will not be recommending 
t h e	p a y m e n t	o f	a	fi n a l	d i v i d e n d .	H o w e v e r ,	
the Board will continue to review the 
situation and remains committed to 
delivering a progressive dividend to 
shareholders in the future.
Carbon Reduction Commitment
The Board maintains its view that the 
Group does not qualify for inclusion in the 
Government’s new Carbon Reduction 
Commitment Scheme (“CRCS”) and 
decided not to register for the Scheme. 
H o w e v e r ,	as	an n o u n c e d	o n	1 4	J u n e	2 0 1 1 ,	
the Department of Energy and Climate 
Change (“DECC”) has subsequently issued 
ATH with an enforcement notice, asserting 
a failure to register as a participant in the 
fi r s t	p h a s e	o f	t h e	C R C S,	w h i c h	t h e	G r o u p	
is appealing. Central to the issue is 
whether or not the electricity consumed 
by ATH’s conveyor, which transports coal 
from its Glenmuckloch site to its railhead 
at New Cumnock some twelve kilometres 
away, is exempt from CRCS. The appeal 
was heard on 7 and 8 November 2011 
and a decision is expected in early 2012. 
The cost to the Group should its appeal 
f a i l	w i l l	b e	in	t h e	o r d e r	o f	£ 1 . 4	m i l l i o n	f o r	
each of the three years from April 2011. 
The Group will update the market 
as appropriate.
Takeover talks
During the year the Group was 
approached by a third party with 
a view to possibly acquiring ATH. 
The Board fully co‑ operated with the 
third party over several months in order 
to achieve the best possible outcome for 
its shareholders but ultimately could not 
agree a basis on which the transaction 
could proceed. Offer talks were 
terminated on 13 September 2011. 
In summary
	 	 De s p it e 	 d i f fi c u lt 	 c o nd it i o n s 	
the Group has delivered 
a n 	 o per a t i n g 	 p r o fi t 	 be f o r e 	
exceptionals of £3.0m 
(2010: £7.0m)
  Net debt reduced for the third 
consecutive year by £3.0m 
to £31.5m
  In light of the loss for the 
year the Board will not be 
recommending a dividend 
but remains committed 
to delivering a progressive 
dividend policy in the future
“The Group expects a continued rise in average 
selling prices and turnover. Bank debt is also 
expected to continue to reduce.”

The year in review
01–13
Banking and restoration 
bond facilities
During the year the Group was able 
to successfully re‑ negotiate its banking 
facilities, increasing the facility available and 
extending the duration to 31 May 2013.
As the Group opens a new site it has 
to provide the local authority with an 
insurance bond to cover the liability of 
restoring the site in the event that the 
Group fails to do so. Recently this market 
has tightened considerably with one of 
the Group’s main providers withdrawing 
from the market and a second provider 
reducing its participation. Maintaining an 
appropriate level of bonding will be one 
of the main challenges facing the Group 
in the coming year. However, the Board 
has recently negotiated additional facilities 
w i th 	 i t s 	 e x i s t ing 	 pro v i de r s 	 an d 	 i s 	 con fi de n t 	
that the necessary bonding facilities will 
be available as and when required for 
both new and exsiting sites.
The Board
I n	J u l y	2 0 1 0	t h e	B o ar d	d e c i d e d	t h at	m y	
position as Non‑ executive Chairman should 
become Executive in order to oversee the 
transition to a new management team 
following the departure of the former 
Chief Executive, Tom Allchurch, and 
Finance Director, Steven Beaumont. Their 
replacements, Alistair Black and Andrew 
Weatherstone, have now been in their 
posts for over twelve months and together 
have conducted a thorough review of the 
business and re‑ negotiated the Group’s 
b an k in g 	 f a c i l i t i e s . 	 T h e 	 B o ar d 	 i s 	 s at i s fi e d 	
that the transition to the new management 
team is complete and that I can resume 
my previous role as Non‑ executive 
Chairman. This change will take effect 
from the date of the Annual General 
Meeting on 29 February 2012.
The Group’s Senior Non‑ executive Director, 
Vaughan Williams, has decided to retire 
from the Board and will step down at the 
Annual General Meeting. The Board would 
like to join me in thanking Vaughan for his 
valuable contribution over the last seven 
years and in wishing him well for the future.
Tim Stokeld will become the Senior 
Independent Director and will chair the 
Audit and Remuneration Committees. 
Outlook
Production is planned to continue at around 
current levels with the Group’s strategy 
focused on delivering as much of the legacy 
contracts as possible whilst continuing to 
comply with its commitments to its banks 
and shareholders, and further reductions 
in debt.
Following the successful re‑ negotiation 
of one of the Group’s remaining legacy 
contracts the Board expects a continued 
rise in average selling prices and turnover. 
However, it recognises that the Group 
is exposed to movements in commodity 
markets and should the recent disconnect 
between rising gas oil prices and falling 
coal prices continue margins will be 
impacted. The new mine at Netherton 
is now in full production as planned 
and Duncanziemere which has recently 
commenced coaling is performing 
satisfactorily and will progressively increase 
production throughout the coming year.
Looking to the longer term, the Group 
continues to develop and invest in new sites 
in order to increase its reserve base and 
to strengthen the business going forward.

 ARM has, for some years, defined itself as being the architecture
for the digital world and in last year’s report I wrote that we were
well on the way to achieving that. What progress have we made
during 2006?
A large number of products in everyday use, from personal organisers
to cars, and from televisions to washing machines, are already likely
to have ARM IP (intellectual property) embedded within them. We are
at the point in the digital revolution where intelligent microelectronics
have made their way out of the workplace – where they have
been transforming technology for a number of years – into people’s
everyday lives.
Our products (our IP) enable companies to design and market their
electronic devices more quickly and more economically and, what is
most important to end consumers, to make them more “intelligent”,
secure and reliable. In my view, we are still only part way through the
digital revolution and we do not really know when we will reach the
end. Therein lie the opportunities for ARM. By enabling innovative
products to be designed and brought to market, our architecture
ensures that the digital revolution will continue to transform our lives.
The digital world
Advances in technology, particularly over the past 20 years, have made
people’s lives more productive and saved them time – man’s most
finite, and therefore most valuable, commodity. People in the developed
world, for example, work approximately 17% fewer hours than they
did in 1950, work itself tends to be more rewarding because many
routine tasks have been taken over by technology, and a huge number
of labour-saving devices at home have removed much of the time-
consuming drudgery traditionally associated with housework. The digital
world not only provides access to hitherto unprecedented levels of
communication, information creation, storage and retrieval, but also
makes life that little bit easier.
The widespread use of ARM processors and technology in mobile
telephony and digital communications is well known, but they
are increasingly permeating other aspects of our everyday lives.
Electronics have, for example, driven more than 90% of the innovation
in the automotive industry. Features which, only a few years ago, were
exclusive to luxury cars are now commonplace: mid-range vehicles now
incorporate up to 70 embedded processors which have improved safety,
added convenience and increased functionality. Our microprocessors
improve braking systems by enabling the wheels to “talk” to one
another; airbags to “read” the size and weight of the person they
are there to protect; engines to start at one turn of the key, no matter

Business review/Chief Executive Officer’s review of operations Business review/Chief Executive Officer’s review of operations/continued
how cold the weather; car interiors quickly to reach a comfortable
temperature; and sound systems to entertain passengers while GPS
(Global Positioning Systems) help find the way. Perhaps most important,
however, in a world in which car use is growing exponentially,
technology has enabled manufacturers to reduce fuel consumption
by as much as 40% and, as a result, to reduce pollution. Safety and
environmental regulations will undoubtedly continue to become more
onerous for manufacturers, and the need to replace expensive
mechanical parts in vehicles with more economical electro-mechanical
and electronic systems will increase. The performance and power-
consumption characteristics of our processors, together with the
unparalleled scope of the design environment we facilitate for the
automotive manufacturers and their semiconductor suppliers, means
that the automotive industry continues to be an exciting growth market
for ARM technology.
There is, however, more to the digital world than making life easier
and more enjoyable for those who live in developed countries.
Advanced technology is playing a leading role in fuelling growth in the
developing world. Its contribution to education, one of the principal
means of lifting people out of poverty, is immense. Equally it contributes
to saving lives, worldwide, by making it possible to predict accurately
natural disasters, such as earthquakes and tsunamis; and plays an
important role in drug research and delivery.
Technology will continue to evolve. ARM’s digital architects are a vital
part of that evolution – they create products that are, and will continue
to be, fundamental to the implementation of the digital world.
Our role in the industry
In any industry progress comes at a cost; in the digital world, this is
because of the significantly increased complexity of the underlying
technology. While consumers (you and I) will be prepared to pay
some premium for new intelligence in a product, they will not pay
significantly more; as a result, manufacturers – and their suppliers –
are under huge pressure to find less expensive ways to produce ever
more intelligent devices. This is where ARM comes into the picture:
our technology makes it easier and more cost effective for companies
to design and make advanced digital products. Our role is not only to
innovate, but also to take structural cost out of the process: we enable
the retail cost of electronic devices to be reduced. Through our licensing
business model, semiconductor companies can effectively share the cost
of the design of our products; they can use our microprocessors at a
fraction of the cost of in-house design. This process applies across our
technology portfolio of microprocessors (the brains of a digital device)
and physical and fabric IP (the bricks and mortar); in the future, it will
also apply to other new products, including graphics, security, and digital
signal processing technology.
8 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006
We estimate that in 2006, 1.5 billion people, a quarter of
the world’s estimated 6 billion population, bought an ARM
Powered product. The IP we sell to our customers enables end users to operate their
devices for long periods without recharging, to connect people more
easily to one another, and to access information whenever and wherever
they want to. I believe it is true to say that without ARM IP , which
balances power with performance and cost, consumer electronics
would not have reached the point they are at today.
When we, our customers, and the other companies which play a part in
bringing digital electronics to the market “get it right”, consumers barely
notice that there is a digital revolution taking place; products quickly
become “must-haves” because of the impact they have on peoples’
lives. It is hard to believe that MP3 players were conceived as recently
as 1991; that the all-in-one Blackberry wireless device was introduced
only seven years ago; and that flat-screen televisions were first available
to the public as recently as 1997. Digital cameras have become so
commonplace that Kodak stopped selling film cameras in North America
and Western Europe in 2004.
The opportunity
The semiconductor industry in which ARM operates is huge – in 2006
it was worth approximately $260 billion, of which IP was approximately
$1.6 billion. We occupy a leading position in the semiconductor market
and expect not only to benefit from the overall growth of the IP
industry, but also to continue to expand our market share by continuing
to bring industry-leading technology to the market. We have already
built a consistently successful business by establishing the world’s
leading microprocessor technology in digital electronic products – now
we are on our way to achieving the same result with physical IP , which
we believe is the next wave of opportunity for optimising structural
costs in the semiconductor industry.
Our future success lies, however, in more than simply seizing the
opportunity to licence technology to our partners; a bigger opportunity
lies in the ubiquity of our technologies in digital products used by
consumers. We estimate that in 2006, 1.5 billion people, a quarter
of the world’s estimated 6 billion population, bought an ARM Powered
product. Approximately 90% of the mobile phones manufactured
today contain at least one ARM product; our goal is for our technology
to penetrate the billions of other products – from washing machines
to printers, and from cars to exercise bicycles – that are bought by the
other three-quarters of the world’s population. The more people who
use our technology in their daily lives, the more benefit we will accrue
from the royalty revenue stream which forms the cornerstone of our
business model and strategy.
During 2006, we implemented and delivered the highest quality
technology to our partners, the industry, and end consumers. I am
confident that we have a bright future as we continue to benefit from
the digital revolution: we are, indeed, well on the way to becoming
the architecture for the digital world.

ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 9 Business review/Financial review/IFRS
2006 was another year of consistent execution and significant
investment in our business, and we are encouraged to have grown
revenues and maintained operating margins despite the weakened
dollar as well as seeing volumes of ARM Powered products growing
47% year-on-year to 2.45 billion units
Performance
Certain revenue key performance indicators appear on page 3.
Other cost and profit indicators are discussed as part of this review.
Revenues
Total revenues for the year ended 31 December 2006 amounted to
£263.3 million (2005: £232.4 million). In US dollar terms, revenues
grew from $418.7 million in 2005 to $483.6 million in 2006, an
increase of 16%. The actual average dollar exchange rate for ARM
in 2006 was $1.84 compared with $1.80 in 2005, which had
the effect of reducing total reported revenues by approximately
£5.2 million based on 2005 rates.
Total licensing revenues in 2006 were £110.6 million, being 42%
of total revenues, compared with £104.3 million or 45% of total
revenues in 2005. In US dollars, total licensing revenues in 2006
were $202.5 million compared with $187.0 million in 2005, an
increase of 8%.
Royalty revenues in 2006 were £107.8 million, representing 41%
of total revenues in the year, compared with £87.8 million or 38%
of total revenues in 2005. Total royalty revenues in US dollars in
2006 were $199.0 million, up 25% from $158.7 million in 2005.
Sales of development systems in 2006 were up 13% to £28.8 million,
being 11% of total revenues, compared with £25.6 million, or 11%
of total revenues in 2005. Service revenues, which include consulting
services and revenues from support, maintenance and training, were
up 10% to £16.1 million in 2006, representing 6% of total revenues,
compared with £14.7 million, or 6% of total revenues in 2005.
Royalty revenues and unit shipments
Total royalty revenues for 2006 were £107.8 million, comprising
£88.7 million from the Processor Division (“PD”) and £19.1 million from
the Physical IP Division (“PIPD”). Royalties in PD came from record unit
shipments of 2.45 billion compared with £72.5 million and 1.67 billion
units in 2005. Dollar royalty revenues earned in PD were $164.1 million,
up 25% on 2005 compared with the increase in year-on-year unit
shipments of 47%. Unit volume growth more than compensated for
the lower average royalty rates and, as all royalty revenue is earned
effectively at 100% margin, represents incremental returns on the
development cost of the ARM technology on which the royalty is earned. ARM continued to benefit from significant growth in the mobile
segment (which includes mobile handsets, Bluetooth devices and
portable media players, such as the Apple iPod), which accounted
for 66% of the units shipped by the ARM Partnership. We also saw
significant growth across a myriad of applications outside the mobile
segment, including smartcards, microcontrollers, automotive, connectivity
devices, hard disk drives and many others. Total non-mobile shipments
which, at 838 million units in 2006 were higher than total shipments
into all applications as recently as 2003, illustrates ARM’s increasing
penetration across the full range of consumer electronics products.
The total number of partners shipping ARM technology-based products
at the end of 2006 was 76 after taking into account corporate activity
within the ARM Partnership. 29 companies were paying royalties for
physical IP products at the end of the year. Strong momentum in PIPD
royalties continued, with a 26% growth in both total and underlying
royalties. Sales of the 130nm and 90nm process nodes continued to
be the fastest-growing segments for PIPD, although more than half of
royalties received in 2006 came from older geometries. The growth in
royalties within PIPD demonstrates the increasing penetration of ARM
physical IP in chip designs.
Gross margin
Gross margins for the year to 31 December 2006 were 88.3%
compared with 88.6% in 2005. Cost of sales in 2006 includes
compensation charges in respect of share-based payments of
£1.0 million (2005: £1.3 million). Excluding compensation charges
in respect of share-based payments, gross margins for the year
to 31 December 2006 were 88.7% (2005: 89.1%).
Operating expenses
Over the past several years, ARM has acquired various companies
with significant values of intangible assets other than goodwill being
recognised; these amounts are amortised over the expected useful lives
of the assets acquired, with the cost recorded against research
and development, sales and marketing or general and administrative
expenses, as appropriate. In order to aid comparability, these costs
have been separately identified as “acquisition-related charges” in the
narrative below. In addition, the issuance of ARM share options to the
employees of Artisan on acquisition, as well as to the ongoing share-
based compensation to employees of the Group, gives rise to significant
non-cash share-based compensation charges. These are also separately
identified in the narrative below.
Total operating expenses in the year to 31 December 2006 were
£182.5 million compared with £170.7 million in 2005, with the increase
primarily attributable to the increase in average headcount from
1,234 in 2005 to 1,472 in 2006. Operating expenses in 2006 include
acquisition-related charges relating to amortisation of intangibles of
£19.3 million (2005: £17.9 million), other acquisition-related charges
of £1.1 million (2005: £nil) and compensation charges in respect of
share-based payments and related payroll taxes of £16.4 million (2005:
£20.3 million). Excluding acquisition-related charges and compensation
charges in respect of share-based payments and related payroll taxes,
total operating expenses in 2006 were £145.7 million in 2005,
compared with £132.5 million in 2005.
Research and development expenses in 2006 were £84.5 million,
representing 32% of revenues. This compares with £80.3 million or 35%
of revenues in 2005. Average headcount in this area increased from

in 2005. Average headcount in this area increased from 165 in 2005 to
209 in 2006. General and administrative expenses in 2006 include total
acquisition-related charges of £0.7 million (2005: £0.7 million) and
compensation charges in respect of share-based payments and related
payroll taxes of £2.8 million (2005: £3.6 million). Excluding acquisition-
related charges and compensation charges in respect of share-based
payments and related payroll taxes, general and administrative
expenses in 2006 were £46.6 million, compared with £38.7 million
in 2005 representing 18% and 17% of revenues respectively.
Additionally in 2006, the Group sold its investment in CSR plc, resulting
in a profit of £5.3 million.
Operating margin
The operating margin in 2006 was 19.0% compared with 15.1% in
2005. The operating margin in 2006, excluding acquisition-related
charges of £20.4 million and compensation charges in respect of
share-based payments and related payroll taxes of £17.4 million,
was 33.3% compared with 32.1%, before acquisition-related charges
of £17.9 million and compensation charges in respect of share-based
payments of £21.5 million, in 2005.
Earnings and taxation
Profit before income tax in 2006 was £56.7 million compared with
£40.5 million in 2005. Profit before income tax in 2006, excluding
acquisition-related charges of £20.4 million and compensation charges
in respect of share-based payments and related payroll taxes of
£17.4 million, was £94.5 million or 35.9% of revenues. This compares
with £79.9 million, before acquisition-related charges of £17.9 million
and compensation charges in respect of share-based payments of
£21.5 million, or 34.4% of revenues in 2005.
ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 13 14 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006
Business review/Financial review/IFRS/continued
The Group’s effective taxation rate in 2006 was 14.2%, compared with
26.8% in 2005. This reduction was primarily due to a non-recurring tax
credit in the year arising from a tax-deductible foreign exchange loss.
Fully-diluted earnings per share in 2006 were 3.5 pence compared
with 2.1 pence in 2005. Earnings per fully diluted share in 2006, before
acquisition-related charges of £20.4 million, compensation charges
in respect of share-based payments and related payroll taxes of
£17.4 million and related estimated tax adjustments thereon of
£9.2 million, were 5.5 pence, compared with 4.2 pence before
acquisition-related charges of £17.9 million, compensation charges
in respect of share-based payments of £21.5 million and related
estimated tax adjustments thereon of £8.9 million, in 2005.
Balance sheet and cash flow
Goodwill at 31 December 2006 was £428.4 million, compared with
£474.4 million at 31 December 2005. The decrease in goodwill in 2006
is primarily due to foreign exchange movements, given the weakening
of the US dollar against sterling, from $1.72 at 31 December 2005 to
$1.96 at the end of 2006. Goodwill arising on the Falanx acquisition
amounted to £9.4 million and on Soisic to £2.2 million. Goodwill is not
amortised under IFRS but is subject to impairment review on at least
an annual basis. The review performed in 2006 concluded that no
impairment was required.
Other intangible assets at 31 December 2006 were £62.9 million,
compared with £79.7 million at 31 December 2005. The movement
in other intangible assets in 2006 reflects the amortisation in the year
of the intangible assets arising on acquisitions of £19.3 million, the
addition of £10.5 million arising on the acquisitions of Falanx and Soisic
and certain assets of PowerEscape during the year and the revaluation
of the currency denominated intangibles, predominantly those in US
dollars. The other intangible assets will be amortised through the
income statement over their estimated useful lives to the Group.
Accounts receivable at 31 December 2006 were £69.6 million, compared
with £55.5 million at 31 December 2005. The allowance against
receivables was £2.6 million at 31 December 2006, compared with
£2.2 million at 31 December 2005. Deferred revenues were £31.5 million
at 31 December 2006, compared with £20.4 million at the end of 2005.
Resources available
The consolidated cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and
marketable securities balance was £128.5 million at 31 December 2006
compared with £160.9 million at 31 December 2005. This reduction is
as a result of the continued share buyback programme and payment
of dividends (see below), as well as the acquisitions of Falanx and
Soisic. Excluding these outflows, the Group generated £73.7 million
of cash in the year (2005: £65.0 million). ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 15
Interest receivable
Interest receivable was £6.8 million for the year to 31 December 2006
compared with £5.3 million in 2005.
Returns to shareholders
Dividends
The directors recommend payment of a final dividend in respect of 2006
of 0.6 pence per share which, taken together with the interim dividend
of 0.4 pence per share paid in October 2006, gives a total dividend
in respect of 2006 of 1.0 pence per share, an increase of 19% over the
0.84 pence per share in 2005. Subject to shareholder approval, the final
dividend will be paid on 21 May 2007 to shareholders on the register
on 4 May 2007.
Total dividends actually paid in 2006 amounted to £12.4 million
(2005: £10.4 million).
Share buyback programme
In 2006, the Group continued its rolling share-buyback programme
to supplement dividends in returning surplus funds to shareholders.
During the year, the Company bought back 63.6 million shares
(2005: 13.9 million) at a total cost of £76.5 million (2005: £16.2 million).
Since introducing dividend payments in 2004 and commencing the
Company’s share buyback programme in July 2005, £125 million has
been returned to shareholders and 77.5 million shares, 5.6% of issued
share capital, have been bought back. This has contributed to a net
reduction in the average fully diluted shares in issue from 1,424 million
in 2005 to 1,402 million in 2006. This programme will continue during
2007 and beyond.
Capital structure
The authorised share capital of the Company is 2,200,000,000 ordinary
shares of 0.05 pence each (2005: 2,200,000,000). The issued share
capital at 31 December 2006 was 1,389,907,834 ordinary shares
of 0.05 pence each (2005: 1,386,102,680). As a result of the buyback
programme, the Company held 49,500,000 of its own shares at
31 December 2006 (2005: 12,751,107).
Treasury policies and objectives and liquidity
The Group has established treasury policies aimed both at mitigating
the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on reported profits and
cash flows and at ensuring appropriate returns are earned on the
Group’s cash resources.
With more than 95% of Group revenues earned in US dollars and
approximately 45% of Group costs being incurred in US dollars, the
Group has a significant exposure to movements in the exchange rate
between the US dollar and sterling. This exposure is partially mitigated
by an ongoing hedging programme, involving forward contracts and
low-risk option contracts where appropriate. Business review/Financial review/IFRS/continued
Principal risks and uncertainties
In line with the guidance for the preparation of an operating and
financial review, certain risk factors faced by the Group are identified
below. A more detailed description is included in the Group’s annual
report on Form 20-F. Details of the Group’s internal control and risk
management procedures are included in the corporate governance
report on pages 20 to 23.
ARM’s quarterly results may fluctuate significantly and be
unpredictable which could adversely affect the market price
of ARM ordinary shares
ARM has experienced, and may in the future experience, significant
quarterly fluctuations in its results of operations. Quarterly results
may fluctuate because of a variety of factors. Such factors include:
– the timing of entering into agreements with new licencees;
– the mixture of licence fees, royalties, revenues from the sale of
development systems and fees from services;
– the introduction of new technology by us, our licencees or
our competition;
– the timing of orders from, and shipments to, systems
companies of ARM technology-based microprocessors from
our semiconductor partners;
– sudden technological or other changes in the microprocessor
industry; and
– new litigation or developments in current litigation.
In future periods, ARM’s operating results may not meet the expectations
of public market analysts or investors. In such an event the market price
of our shares could be materially adversely affected.
General economic conditions may reduce ARM’s revenues and harm
ARM’s business
ARM is subject to risks arising from adverse changes in global economic
conditions. Because of economic uncertainties in many of our key
markets, many industries may delay or reduce technology purchases
and investments. The impact of this on ARM is difficult to predict,
but if businesses defer licensing our technology, require less services
or development tools, or if consumers defer purchases of new products
which incorporate ARM’s technology, revenue could decline. A decline
in revenue would have an adverse effect on the results of operations
and could have an adverse effect on ARM’s financial condition.
ARM competes in the intensely competitive semiconductor market
The semiconductor market is intensely competitive and characterised
by rapid technological change. ARM cannot give assurance that it will
have the financial resources, technical expertise, or marketing or support
capabilities to compete successfully in the future.
Competition is based on a variety of factors including price, performance,
product quality, software availability, marketing and distribution capability,
customer support, name recognition and financial strength. Further,
given ARM’s reliance on our semiconductor partners, its competitive
position is dependent on their competitive position. In addition, ARM’s
16 ARM Annual report and accounts 2006 semiconductor partners do not license ARM’s architecture exclusively,
and several of them also design, develop, manufacture and market
microprocessors based on their own architectures or on other
non-ARM architectures.
ARM may not operate systems which comply fully with the
requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
Attestation under section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as at
31 December 2006 has been successfuly completed. Full details appear
in the Group’s annual report on Form 20-F. There can be no guarantee,
however, that in future the detailed testing of internal controls required
as part of the attestation process will not identify significant control
deficiencies or material weaknesses that impact on the auditors’ opinion
on internal controls over financial reporting and/or require disclosure
on Form 20-F for future years.
Other risks include ARM’s inability to manage the significant changes
in the number of its employees and the size of its operations in the
United States, dependence on semiconductor Partners and systems
companies, availability of development tools, systems software and
operating systems compatible with ARM’s architecture, dependence on
a small number of customers and products, ARM’s inability to develop

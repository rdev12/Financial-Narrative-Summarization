OVERVIEW
HIGHLIGHTS
Very good progress in delivering our strategic plan – 
“Nouvelle Confiance”
• 
Good results from the “4Ds” plan:
• 
Positive like-for-like sales and significant market 
share gains in France and Belgium; 
• 
Continued growth of web-generated sales, up 
nearly 10 per cent to over 13 per cent of total 
product sales; and
• 
€50 million cost reduction programme 
substantially completed with benefits to be 
delivered in full by the end of 2014/15.
• 
Steps taken to deliver medium-term target to build 
market share and profitability over the next three 
years by:
• 
expanding the Darty portfolio into smaller 
catchment areas with a new franchise model. 
The first four stores opened in H2;
• 
increasing our web penetration and extending 
the “low price/pay-as-you-go services” offer 
through the acquisition of leading French 
website Mistergooddeal.com; and
• 
doubling the number of stores with the 
kitchen offer.
• 
Eliminating losses in our non-core markets  
with the managed closure of Spain and the  
sale of our business in Turkey.

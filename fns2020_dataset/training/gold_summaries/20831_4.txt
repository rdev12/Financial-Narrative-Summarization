Our markets
Reinsurance market 
•  The global reinsurance market provides 
risk transfer and contingent capital to 
insurance companies.
•  Amlin underwrites reinsurance principally 
from its Syndicate 2001 and Amlin 
Bermuda platforms. The main focus of 
Amlin’s reinsurance portfolio is catastrophe 
reinsurance which protects against major 
losses caused by natural catastrophes, 
such as hurricanes or earthquakes.
•  The market is dominated by large 
reinsurers in Germany, Switzerland, 
Bermuda, the US and within Lloyd’s.
Commercial insurance market
•  This market provides motor, property 
and liability insurance to commercial 
enterprises and individuals.
•  UK commercial business written by 
Amlin UK is sourced through Lloyd’s 
and regional brokers.
•  Amlin Corporate Insurance is a major 
participant in the commercial market in 
the Benelux countries, sourcing business 
through the Dutch Beurs co-insurance 
market and local brokers.
Global specialty market 
•  This market insures a wide range of risks 
which are typically commercial, large and 
complex, requiring specialist underwriting 
expertise and individually tailored cover.
•  Distinct markets include the US surplus 
lines market and the international marine 
and aviation markets.
•  The majority of Amlin’s specialty business 
comes from the US. The acquisition of ACI 
has significantly increased our presence in 
Continental European specialty markets.
•  Our office in Singapore covers Asian 
energy and cargo business.

Amlin distribution channels
Serving a global client base
The majority of our business is sourced 
through independent insurance brokers. 
Brokers provide a global distribution network 
and, because of their knowledge of Amlin’s 
products and services, provide an effi cient 
distribution channel for our business. 
We favour specifi c direct risk, known as 
facultative insurance, and treaty reinsurance 
which provides tailored cover for an 
insurance company client’s own portfolio. 
Business underwritten in this way provides 
us with control over the pricing and terms 
of the contract and we tend to have a 
greater connection with the ultimate 
insured, or reinsured. 
We are also prepared to partner intermediaries, 
managing general agents and insurance 
brokers, in underwriting on binding authorities 
or lineslips, where their controls are perceived 
to be good and our ability to infl uence the 
type of business accepted is high. This is 
imperative as binding authorities assign the 
day-to-day underwriting to the underwriting 
agents or brokers. For these contracts, 
we are reliant on the intermediary to apply 
judgement on our behalf, although they 
are given a clear framework within which 
to work. In these circumstances the 
intermediary is incentivised to produce 
an underwriting profi t through the payment 
of profi t commission.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2009
A diverse 
and well 
balanced 
business
Amlin writes a diverse portfolio of risk. 
This diversity has been further broadened 
during 2009 with the acquisition of Amlin 
Corporate Insurance. 
While the business overall is inﬂ uenced 
by the cyclical nature of insurance 
markets, the diversity of the portfolio 
means that pricing and claims are not 
heavily correlated across different classes. 
Our ﬂ exible underwriting strategy allows 
us to optimise capital allocation according 
to the relative strength of our markets.

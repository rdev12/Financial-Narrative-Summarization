Chairman's statement
“ I am pleased to report further progress  
in 2014 in what remained a challenging 
economic environment and against 
considerable currency headwinds.”
Bill Whiteley 
Chairman
Key points in this section:
• Sales increased by 5% at constant 
currency to £678.3 million
• Unfavourable currency movements 
reduced sales on translation by 
6.4%
• Operating profit increased by 
12% at constant currency to 
£153.0 million
• Operating profit margin rose to a 
record 22.5% 
• Increase in the total ordinary 
dividend of 9% to 64.5p per share 
and a special dividend of 120.0p 
per share
an increase in pre‑ tax profit at constant 
exchange rates of 12% to £151. 1 million; a 
small advance on the prior year reported 
pre‑ tax profit. Adjusted earnings per share 
rose by 1% to 140.4p (2013: 138.8p) and by 
13% at constant currency.
We have today announced that the Group 
has established a wholly‑ owned company 
in India and that we expect to start direct 
sales in mid‑ 2015. We have also sold the 
Group’s 49.3% interest in Spirax Marshall 
Private Limited in India to our local partners, 
with both parties now free to trade under 
their own respective names, inside and 
outside India.
Cash and dividends
Cash inflow was again strong with good 
cash conversion and we finished the year 
with net cash of £52 million.
The interim dividend, which was paid in 
November 2014, was raised by 8% to 19.5p 
per share (2013: 18.0p per share). The Board 
is recommending an increase in the final 
dividend to 45.0p per share (2013: 41.0p) 
payable on 29th May 2015 to shareholders 
on the register at 1st May 2015. The total 
ordinary dividend for the year is therefore 
64.5p per share, an increase of 9% over the 
59.0p per share for the prior year.
Following a review of the Company’s capital 
requirements and recognising the Group’s 
significant cash generation capability, the 
Board is also recommending a return of 
capital to shareholders of £91 million by 
way of a special dividend of 120p per share 
in respect of 2014 (2013: nil). The dividend 
will be payable on 15th July 2015 to 
shareholders on the register at 12th June 
2015. This return represents approximately 
4% of the market capitalisation of the 
Company and the Board is recommending 
that this is combined with an appropriate 
share consolidation to maintain, as far as 
possible, the comparability of the share price 
before and after the special dividend.
A full review of our financial performance 
commences on page 30.
Employees
On behalf of the Board, I thank all our 
employees around the world for their 
dedication, hard work and individual 
contributions to these good results. 
Our people are our most valuable asset  
and it is through the application and skills 
of our employees, in our 70 operating 
units, that we achieve success for all key 
stakeholders in our business and the 
communities in which we work.
Governance and Board 
changes
In May 2014, the Board was pleased to 
announce the appointment of Jamie Pike as 
an independent Non‑ Executive Director and 
Senior Independent Director, bringing his 
broad industrial and international business 
experience to the Board. Jamie replaced 
Gareth Bullock who stepped down at the 
AGM in May 2014, having completed the 
nine‑ year maximum tenure for assured 
independence. The Board would like to 
thank Gareth for his significant contribution 
and thoughtful counsel over many 
years. In consequence of Mr Bullock 
stepping down, Dr Krishnamurthy 
Rajagopal took over as Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee.
The Board continues to support the 
on‑ going improvements in corporate 
governance and reporting, and was pleased 
that the Group’s 2013 Annual Report was 
recognised in the top ten for “Excellence in 
Reporting in the FTSE 250” at the Building 
Public Trust Awards. The Board is ultimately 
responsible for ensuring a successful and 
sustainable business, and operates to 
the highest level of ethical and corporate 
governance standards and best practices 
to achieve this. The work of the Board 
and its Committees is clearly set out in the 
Performance
Sales increased by 5% at constant 
currency to £678.3 million, including a 
small contribution of nearly 1% from the 
acquisition of BioPure in January 2014. 
Unfavourable currency movements reduced 
sales on translation by 6.4% leaving reported 
sales down 2% compared with sales of 
£689.4 million in 2013. We achieved good 
organic sales growth in Watson‑ Marlow and 
in the Americas, with modest growth in Asia 
Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa 
(EMEA).
Operating profit increased by 12% at 
constant currency to £153.0 million, with 
a strong improvement in Watson‑ Marlow, 
good gains in the Americas and a further 
advance in EMEA and in Asia Pacific. 
At reported exchange rates, operating profit 
was ahead 1%, having been impacted by 
a negative currency impact of £15 million. 
The operating profit margin rose to a record 
22.5% from 22.0%, despite the stiff currency 
headwind. Net finance costs increased 
and the contribution from our Associate 
company in India was 32% lower, giving  Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 03

Prospects
Our Spirax Sarco steam specialties 
and Watson‑ Marlow niche pumps and 
associated fluid technology businesses 
serve numerous different applications 
across a wide and diverse range of 
industries on a direct sales basis utilising 
the knowledge and experience of our 1,300 
sales and service engineers. This direct 
sales approach, with an increasing sector 
focus, delivers genuine value to customers 
in the form of energy savings and emission 
reductions, water savings, productivity 
gains, quality improvements and solutions to 
difficult pumping and fluid control problems. 
Steam is used as the heat source in many 
industrial processes and a high proportion 
of sales come from customers’ operating 
and maintenance spending. Our markets 
therefore reflect general economic 
conditions and in particular the rates of 
growth in industrial production. All these 
factors, together with the implementation of 
our growth strategy to pursue a relentless 
focus on customer service, market 
development, product development and 
excellence in manufacturing, mean that we 
are able to outperform our market growth, 
whilst retaining considerable resilience.
Overall, market conditions in 2014 were 
lacklustre, with industrial production growth 
slowing through the second half of the year 
in both developed and developing markets. 
We achieved good trading results in part due 
to a strong performance in Watson‑ Marlow, 
favourable mix and tight overhead controls. 
Our assumption is that, overall, the world 
economy will be no better in the current year 
than that seen in 2014. If recent exchange

rates prevail for the full year, there would still 
be a small translation headwind to sales of 
2% in 2015, as the impact of the weaker 
euro outweighs the benefits of the stronger 
dollar and related currencies. We are 
increasing investment and adding resources 
to develop the business as we execute 
our growth strategy, and focus on our 
priorities for generating our own growth and 
outperforming our markets. These factors, 
together with our fundamental strengths, 
give the Board confidence that we will 
achieve further progress in 2015.

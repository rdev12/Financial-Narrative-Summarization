 An exciting year 
for Gamma
Chairman’s statement
2014 has been an excellent 
year for Gamma with a 
successful AIM listing  
and revenue and profit 
continuing to increase.
Introduction
I am very pleased to present my  
first report on the results of Gamma 
Communications plc for the year ended 
31 December 2014 since its successful 
IPO and listing on the Alternative 
Investment Market (AIM) on 10 October 
2014. To have the opportunity to be 
Chairman of a growing and dynamic 
company such as Gamma, operating  
in the vibrant communications market, 
and working with a truly professional 
Board and management team is very 
exciting and one to which I am greatly 
looking forward.
Gamma has had exceptional support 
from its founder Shareholders for many 
years; they nurtured its growth and 
provided an environment in which it 
could develop into the successful 
business it is today. We are pleased that 
they remain significant Shareholders  
as the Company moves to its next phase 
of growth and development as an AIM 
listed company. The AIM listing provided 
Gamma with the opportunity to broaden 
its Shareholder base, give it access to 
new sources of capital for future growth 
and development and provide increased 
visibility and recognition for the 
business in its markets.
Overview of results 
Overall Group revenue for the year  
ended 31 December 2014 increased  
by £24.5m to £173.2m (2013: £148.7m),  
an increase of 16% compared to the  
year ended 31 December 2013. Of  
this increase, £17 .9m came from the 
indirect channels business which grew 
revenue to £136.9m (2013: £119.0m) 
and £6.6m from the direct business 
which saw revenue increase to £36.3m 
(2013: £29.7m). 
Gross profit for the year to 31 December 
2014 amounted to £67 .6m, an increase 
of 25% compared to the £53.9m 
achieved in 2013, whilst the gross profit 
percentage increased to 39.0% (2013: 
36.2%). EBITDA, before exceptional costs 
and share based payments, for the Group 
as a whole increased to £23.1m (2013: 
£17 .2m), an increase of 34% compared to 
the previous year. Adjusted earnings per 
share for the year ended 31 December 
2014 were 15.0p (2013: 10.8p); 
unadjusted earnings per share were 
10.0p (2013: 9.9p).
The net operating cash inflow for the 
year was £16.4m compared to £14.0m  
in 2013. This represents a cash to 
EBITDA ratio in respect of 2014 of 92% 
compared to 86% for 2013. Despite the 
increased capital expenditure and other 
exceptional items, net cash as at 31 
December 2014 amounted to £13.4m, 
which is marginally down from £14.6m 
as at 31 December 2013. 
Dividend 
Gamma, as stated at the time of the IPO, 
is committed to a progressive dividend 
policy. I am therefore pleased to announce 
that a dividend, in respect of the year 
ended 31 December 2014, of 3.95 pence 
per share will, subject to the necessary 
Shareholder approval at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting, be payable to 
Shareholders on the register at 5 June 
2015. This dividend represents a yield of 
2.1% on the IPO price.
Corporate development 
Not surprisingly, Gamma’s focus in 2014 
was the successful IPO of the business, 
which in itself will enhance the corporate 
development opportunities available  
to the Company. It does, however,  
remain Gamma’s intention to look for 
opportunities to invest in new business 
areas and make appropriate earnings-
enhancing acquisitions which support  
6 its strategic objectives. In 2014 Gamma 
came to an agreement with the vendors 
of Varidion Limited (acquired in 2012)  
to settle the deferred element of the 
consideration early by paying £2.6m  
in cash. This was considered appropriate 
as it has enabled the integration and 
development of the business and  
its management to be completed  
more quickly.
In December 2014 Gamma purchased 
control equipment that provides the core 
of a mobile network. When brought into 
active use, currently anticipated to be 
2016, the Group will have much greater 
control and flexibility over its mobile 
services and be much better positioned 
for the widely anticipated market for 
converged services, with a specific  
focus on the business market.
Board and employees 
As part of the preparation for IPO a 
number of changes to the Board took 
place during 2014. Firstly, I should like  
to thank Owen Jonathan, previously 
Chairman, who retired from the Board  
in May 2014, and Ean Kuok and Steve 
Burton, who resigned from the Board  
just prior to the IPO, for their tremendous 
input into the Company and for their 
support and encouragement to the 
executive management team. Secondly,  
I should like to welcome the new members 
of the Board, Alan Gibbins and Martin  
Lea, who both joined in June 2014 as 
Independent Non-Executive Directors; 
they have taken on the roles of Chairman 
of the Audit Committee and of the 
Remuneration Committee respectively.  
I should also like to welcome Andrew 
Belshaw who was appointed to the  
Board as Finance Director in October 
2014; I believe the Board as presently 
constituted has a wealth of experience 
and the necessary understanding to help 
take Gamma through its next stage of 
development and beyond.
The senior executives, managers and 
employees are the bedrock of Gamma 
and they have significantly contributed 
to the creation of the successful 
company we have today. I should like  
to thank them for their consistent hard 
work and continued support, especially 
during the IPO process when, despite  
the significant increase in workload  
of the executive Board members and  
the senior executive team, the business 
continued to grow and develop 
successfully and provide excellent 
support to our customers and partners. 
Gamma is fully supportive of 
apprenticeship schemes, employee 
volunteering within the local community 
and has a policy of matched funding  
for charitable activities by staff. 
Employee motivation and development 
are fundamental principles of Gamma  
and lead, we believe, to a successful  
and strong business.
Outlook 
The Board looks forward to 2015  
with great enthusiasm and believes  
that Gamma will continue to benefit  
from the investment it has made and 
continues to make in its direct and 
indirect business channels. Gamma’s 
stated vision is to continue to grow  
both its market share and profitability  
by developing new innovative 
communications products for business 
and the public sector. We believe that 
Gamma has the experience, resources 
and capabilities to continue to achieve  
its objectives.

Strategic report 
Financial highlights 
How we create value
Expand 
Our strategy is to continue to 
expand our revenues and further 
internationalise the Group, through 
organic growth and through 
bolt-on acquisitions to improve 
the scale of our operations in 
a speciﬁc market or expand 
the depth of our services.
Focus
Our strategy is to focus solely  
on niche services that have  
high barriers to entry, signiﬁcant 
value-added content, and a  
global potential. 
Cost leadership
Our strategy is to exercise  
Group-wide cost leadership,  
in order to best focus our 
resources on delivering our 
customers’ needs.
Differentiate
Our strategy is to differentiate our 
services through our people, via 
our shared values of achievement, 
integrity, accountability and 
innovation, and through our 
investments in technology.
1 Synergy Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Reliable, cost-effective sterilisation 
underpins the efﬁciency of our customers’ 
operations, and ensures their medical 
instruments and devices are safe to use. 
Investment case
Critical.
Synergy provides a critical service for our hospital and medical  
device manufacturing customers. Synergy deploys the full range of 
technologies, worldwide, to sterilise instruments and devices for our 
customers: gamma irradiation, electron, ion and x-ray beam treatments, 
plasma and ethylene oxide sterilisation. These technologies provide 
niche high-value solutions and, combined with our accumulated 
expertise and the strength of our quality systems, make Synergy  
a critical part of the healthcare market. 
By comparison, in-house sterilisation units often lack investment, 
training and instrument tracking technologies. Research shows that high 
levels of ﬂash sterilisation in many in-house hospital sterilisation units 
lead to higher rates of post-operative infections. Across many of our 
markets, we can see more demanding regulatory requirements driving 
business opportunities for our services. 
2 Synergy Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 3 Synergy Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 R es ilient .
We are a niche service provider  
operating globally in regulated markets  
with high barriers to entry. Our stable 
underlying business mitigates risk and 
provides a platform for growth.
Investment case
4 Synergy Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Synergy’s businesses enjoy signiﬁcant barriers to entry which make it 
difﬁcult for customers or potential competitors to achieve our low costs 
and efﬁciencies. 
One such barrier is our extensive global network of processing facilities, 
including the backup capacity that is essential to meet our customers’ 
needs. This investment would be expensive and time-consuming  
to replicate. 
Further , approximately 50% of the Group’s revenue is derived from  
long duration contracts (between three and 40 years). In our Applied 
Sterilisation T echnologies (‘AST’) business, where long-term contracts are 
not typical, Synergy has worked hard to build long-term relationships with 
customers and enjoys excellent retention. 
Our businesses have accumulated signiﬁcant technical expertise. Our 
AST business includes the design, operation and maintenance of facilities 
utilising radioactive cobalt, and electron and x-ray beam irradiators. Our 
Hospital Sterilisation Services (‘HSS’) business holds the knowledge,  
data and expertise required to rapidly outsource a complex logistical 
environment whilst generating signiﬁcant operational and total-cost 
efﬁciencies for the customer . 
Finally, all our businesses must comply with stringent regulatory 
standards, which are maintained using the complex systems and  
quality procedures that Synergy has developed over its 22-year history.
5 Synergy Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Growing.
We are a dynamic business realising the 
growth opportunities within our global 
markets. We are delivering on our growth 
strategies, and leveraging our potential to 
exploit exciting future prospects.
Investment case
6 Synergy Health plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 Synergy is the largest global provider of outsourced Hospital 
Sterilisation Services (‘HSS’), and has the scale to differentiate itself 
from in-house solutions and commercial competitors by continuing to 
invest in new technology. This presents an opportunity to revolutionise 
the assembly of surgical instrument trays, as well as decrease risk 
in the operating theatre. With recent wins of £48 million per annum 
in the US and China, together with a re-opening of the UK market, 
the Group is poised to see a strong return to growth. 
Synergy is the second largest global provider of Applied Sterilisation 
T echnologies (‘AST’), and the largest outside of the US. Our objective  
is to grow AST through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions, 
whilst differentiating our services through technology and our people. 
During the year we opened a new gamma facility in Marcoule, France, 
began utilising new capacity in Venlo, Holland and, after the year end, 
completed the acquisition of Bioster Group in Italy, extending our 
network further east into Italy, Slovakia and the Czech Republic.

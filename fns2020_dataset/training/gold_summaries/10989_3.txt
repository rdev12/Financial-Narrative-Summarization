 Netcall has made good operational progress this year and achieved
this in a business environment which has been much more
demanding than previously, and it is clear that while Netcall has been
resilient, the Group has not been immune to the wider economic
downturn. The second half of the financial year showed improvement
and we continue to make solid progress, positioning us well to
achieve growth in the future. 
We have continued to sign new customers and our customer base is
broader than ever covering the financial sector, communications,
utilities, retail and the government sectors amongst others. With our
strong cash position, we therefore believe we are well positioned to
weather the current downturn and benefit from any changes in 
overall market conditions. The Group’s cash position continues to
strengthen and increased by 24% during the year to £2.92 million
(2007 — £2.68 million)
The figures reported today for the year to 30th June 2008 resulted in
revenues for the year of £3.6 million. Encouragingly revenues in the
second half grew by 13% when compared to the first half and
accordingly profit margins were restored.
Gross margins for the year grew to 89% (2007 — 87%) which
combined with a reduction in operating costs by 4% to £2.6 million
(2007 — £2.8 million) contributed to the Group achieving a solid profit
margin and generating significant cash.
It is clear that the strategy implemented in 2005, to move towards the
delivery of our products via a Software as a Service (SaaS) model, is
providing a robust stream of recurring revenues, reducing our reliance
on large licence deals, whilst at the same time increasing our market
reach through channel partners. This is enhancing the business in
today’s tough market, and we believe will continue to do so. 
We have had an encouraging start to the new financial year and we
shall continue to seek new opportunities to broaden our market
reach, develop our products in anticipation of market demand and
explore all avenues to deliver enhanced shareholder value.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff and our partners
for their continued support and contribution. Netcall consists of many
talented people, whose dedication to the Group and belief in the
power of our products is fundamental to our robust success.

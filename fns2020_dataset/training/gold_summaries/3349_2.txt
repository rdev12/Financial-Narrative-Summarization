“As we progress through 2008, we see significant opportunities for both ESAB and Howden arising from their global presence,
market leadership positions, their strong technology and flexible cost bases, supported by Charter’s strengthened balance
sheet. There are positive long-term dynamics in key end-user segments of both ESAB and Howden, such as power, oil and
gas, petrochemicals and shipbuilding. 
The current year has started well. Markets remain strong with positive trends in both the mature markets of Europe and 
North America and the emerging markets worldwide, with particular strength in South America. The Board, therefore, views 
the outlook for 2008 at this early stage of the year with confidence.”

Ergomed provides clinical development 
services to over 60 clients ranging from 
top 10 pharmaceutical companies to 
small and mid-sized drug development 
companies. Ergomed successfully 
manages clinical development from 
Phase I through to late phase 
programmes.
Ergomed has a wide therapeutic focus, 
with a particular expertise in oncology, 
neurology and immunology and the 
development of orphan drugs. Ergomed 
believes its approach to clinical trials is 
differentiated from that of other 
providers by its innovative Study Site 
Management model and the use of Study

development services, Ergomed is 
building a portfolio of co-development 
partnerships with pharma and biotech 
companies which share the risks and 
rewards of drug development. Ergomed 
leverages its expertise and services in 
return for carried interest in the drugs 
under development.

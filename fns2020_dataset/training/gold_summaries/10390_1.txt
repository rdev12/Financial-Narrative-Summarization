Chief 
Executive’s 
review
At the end of my ﬁ rst full year as 
Chief Executive, I am delighted 
that we have continued our record 
of double digit growth, increasing 
revenue by 14.5% in the year. Our 
operating proﬁ t before amortisation 
has increased by 20.5% and all three 
of our divisions have performed well, 
enabling us to maintain our overall 
underlying operating proﬁ t margins 
within our target range at 5.1%. 
In order to deliver value to our 
stakeholders by delivering future 
sustainable growth, we have spent 
the year ensuring that we are well 
placed to meet the needs of our 
ever changing markets.
We have aligned our Facilities 
Services division to focus on growth 
in the FM and multi-service markets. 
With the formation of our new 
FM business, we are now able to 
compete for the larger FM contracts. 
The business now provides us with 
a vehicle that has been created 
to really understand our clients’ FM 
needs and show how we can match 
them with MITIE’s capabilities. 
Our Property Services division has 
been reorganised to align our 
specialist skills to the market place 
in which we operate. We are 
intent on making each area of our 
business a truly national offering, 
focusing on rooﬁ ng, minor repairs 
and redecoration, interior ﬁ t-out, 
plumbing and heating, social 
housing and ﬁ re protection.
Our Engineering Services division has 
also been focusing on aligning the 
structure of the division with its three 
main markets: energy; technology 
and infrastructure; and building 
services. In the energy markets, we 
offer a full energy management 
consultancy for our clients, reducing 
their carbon footprints through 
renewable technologies and use of 
efﬁ cient materials. The technology 
and infrastructure markets 
concentrate on providing information 
communications technology services 
(ICT) as well as power generation and 
cooling solutions for data centres. The 
building services market is the more 
traditional mechanical and electrical 
contracting arm of the business.
We have had an excellent year and 
have delivered record results. Our 
business is focused on growth through 
its strength in integrated facilities, 
property and engineering services. 
We are conﬁ dent in our ability to 
make progress in this economic 
climate and there are positive trading 
conditions across all three divisions. 
We have a record order book 
and are well positioned to deliver 
sustainable, proﬁ table growth.
Order book
Our forward order book has grown 
to £4.4bn (2007: £4.1bn). 82% of this 
order book is within our Facilities 
Services division, 11% within Property 
Services and 7% in Engineering 
Services. This year , we have secured 
78% of our budgeted revenue for 
the year ending 31 March 2009 
compared to 75% at the same 
point last year. 
Acquisitions
We continue to seek to acquire 
businesses that complement or ﬁ t 
within our existing company and in 
2008 made three acquisitions. In April 
2007, we acquired Jabez Holdings 
Limited, the holding company of the 
Robert Prettie plumbing business. 
In March 2008, we completed 
the acquisitions of both Catering 
Partnership Holdings Limited and 
DW Tilley Limited.
All three acquisitions complement 
our existing activities: 
•  Robert Prettie is a Nottingham-
based business that works in 
partnership with local authorities, 
councils, developers and 
registered social landlords on 
kitchen and bathroom installations, 
heating replacement, gas 
servicing, maintenance and 
call-out services. This acquisition 
has added signiﬁ cantly to the 
capabilities of our Property Services 
division in the housing sector and 
has complemented the existing 
regional operations; 
“ We have realigned 
our divisions to 
meet the needs of 
our ever changing 
markets.” 22 MITIE Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2008
•  Catering Partnership Holdings 
Limited is a Midlands-based 
catering company. The company 
complements the geographical 
coverage of our existing 
operations; and 
•  DW Tilley Limited is a national 
rooﬁ ng contractor , based in 
the North East of England. The 
company complements our 
existing Property Services division 
and provides us with a national 
rooﬁ ng capability.
Equity incentivisation
We continue to start new businesses 
and support ﬁ rst generation equity 
start-ups within MITIE. In October 
2007 we started MITIE Client Services 
Limited. This business operates 
within the Facilities Services division 
and will provide clients with high 
quality, client facing support services 
including reception, switchboard, 
helpdesk and events management. 
As part of the development of 
our equity incentivisation model, 
we have introduced a second 
generation equity scheme into 
some of our established businesses 
to provide an equity opportunity 
for the new management teams 
within those businesses whereby 
management share the risks and 
rewards of ownership.
Second generation schemes have 
been set up in our Property Services 
division and also in the Cleaning, 
Landscaping and Security businesses 
within our Facilities Services division. 
The second generation scheme in 
our Security business was introduced 
on 4 October 2007 following 
shareholder approval at an EGM. 
The introduction of this scheme 
is important for the successful 
development and consolidation 
of our Security business which has 
grown rapidly, particularly over the 
last two years. 
Our Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
scheme was also introduced in July 
2007 following shareholder approval 
at the AGM. EPS growth targets 
over three years form the basis of 
the performance criteria for the 
LTIP , with shares being offered to a 
number of key senior management. 
This scheme ensures that we have 
market leading reward mechanisms 
to attract the best management 
in our sector to MITIE.
Market development
Our markets have always been 
demanding and will continue to 
be so. Uncertainty in the general 
economy creates opportunity for 
MITIE as customers seek innovation 
and fresh thinking from their service 
providers. Our relatively low market 
share, range of services and 
integrated delivery makes us 
an attractive partner. 
One way that customers are saving 
money and increasing efﬁ ciency 
is through enlarging the scope of 
facilities contracts. The move towards 
larger multi-service and FM contracts 
provides us with opportunity due to 
our unrivalled range of services and 
wealth of knowledge. 
The workplace environment is more 
demanding than ever for our clients. 
Issues such as waste and recycling, 
energy management, carbon 
footprint and through-life cost asset 
management all demand forward 
thinking and integration into their 
strategic planning.
MITIE is well positioned to take 
advantage of these current 
markets and has the capability 
to provide integrated services 
through a measured and thought-
out approach. We can assist 
our clients by using the expertise 
developed within our business in 
these increasingly complex areas, 
providing the thought needed to 
develop integrated solutions that 
understand the unique needs of 
each and every client.
In our engineering markets, we are 
ﬁ nding that clients are increasingly 
looking to award contracts on a 
framework basis. The long-term 
visibility provided by a framework 
approach to workload allocation 
and the continued aggregation of 
the procurement philosophy of both 
public and private sector customers 
continues to work to MITIE’s beneﬁ t. 
We are well placed to take 
advantage of this shift in work type 
due to our substantial knowledge of 
key sectors, our national capability 
and our expertise of renewable 
technologies.
The engineering sector is also 
responding to new legislation, in 
particular the requirement of energy 
certiﬁ cates for all buildings that 
are constructed, sold, rented or 
occupied. The certiﬁ cates will show

Our business is structured to face the needs

how energy efﬁ cient a building is 
and how much CO
2
 it emits into the 
atmosphere. Responsible contractors 
within this sector are providing the 
expertise and innovation to deal 
with this new requirement. MITIE has 
invested heavily in resources and 
is actively involved in the design 
and application of more efﬁ cient 
forms of energy generation and 
distribution to the built environment. 
This commitment and investment 
ensures that our Engineering Services 
division is at the forefront when it 
comes to advising clients and the 
supply chain on planning regulations 
and requirements.
Our Property Services division 
continues to operate in diverse 
markets. The acquisition of Robert 
Prettie provides us with the technical 
ability and expertise to create a 
service aimed at the wider housing 
market. We believe this new 
offering will prove attractive to the 
sector and provide us with future, 
sustainable organic growth. The 
social housing market continues to 
afford us opportunities to increase 
our presence in this sector. 
International services
MITIE is the UK’s market leader in 
providing facilities, property and 
engineering services. As our markets 
are very fragmented, we still only 
have a relatively small market 
share in the UK. Our primary focus 
remains on growing our UK business. 
Nevertheless, we do have the 
capability to deliver contracts outside 
the UK when asked to do so by our 
increasingly global client base. 
Corporate responsibility (CR)
For us, CR is about behaviour and 
attitude. We aim to ensure that our 
CR programme involves every area 
of our business. CR is undoubtedly 
a differentiator for us, and has 
been cited as the deciding factor 
for some clients when awarding 
us contracts. CR issues, such as 
reducing the carbon footprint of 
buildings, create opportunities for us 
as we have substantial experience in 
renewable energy technology and 
energy consultancy.
This year we will publish our third CR 
Report. The Report covers our CR 
programme in detail and expands 
upon the summary of our CR 
performance that is in this Annual 
Report and Accounts. We are proud 
of this year’s achievements including 
gaining a silver award scoring 81.5% 
in Business in the Community’s 
Corporate Responsibility Index (2007: 
bronze award with 70.0%) and 
featuring in the Top 100 ‘Companies 
that Count’ for the second year 
in a row. The index is a voluntary, 
self-assessment survey, providing 
an annual benchmark of how 
companies manage, measure and 
report their corporate responsibility. 
Our greatest asset is our people
We continue to see our people as 
being our greatest and most valued 
asset. Without their commitment 
and hard work, MITIE would not be 
successful, so I would like to thank 
personally all of our people for their 
efforts over the last 12 months. 
We have always recognised and 
promoted success within MITIE and 
this year have launched a new 
recognition scheme called MITIE 
Stars. The new scheme will be a 
key tool in recognising excellence 
within MITIE, helping us to drive 
performance improvement and 
support the need for consistency 
across the organisation.
In MITIE, our success has been built 
on the strength of our teams. It 
is unusual for us to single out the 
contribution of one individual, but on 
this occasion I would like to extend 
my personal thanks and those of the 
Board to David Ord, who will step 
down as non-executive Chairman 
of MITIE following our AGM in July 
2008. David has been instrumental in 
supporting the development of the 
Group since his appointment and I 
wish him every success in the future.

Rewarding our stars
We have launched a new employee 
awards scheme across MITIE in order 
to give something back in return for all 
their energy and commitment. It’s called 
the MITIE Stars awards scheme and it 
will make sure that the most important 
part of our business is recognised and 
rewarded – our people. The overall 
winner will take home more than £25,000 
worth in prizes from a total prize fund of 
more than £100,000.

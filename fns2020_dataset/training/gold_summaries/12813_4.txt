of	production	cleanrooms.
The	facility	in	P rescott,	Arizona	was	
constructed	in	1997	and	has	received	
in	excess	of	$50m	of	investment	since	
then .	This	high	volume	high-tech	fab

the	most	effective	wafer	reclaim	ser vices	
to	our	customers	with	minimal	silicon	
removal.	This	enables	our	customers	
to	maximise	the	number	of	times	
a	test	wafer	can	be	reclaimed.
Pure Wafer is a worldwide leader in the provision 
of 300mm wafer reclaim services. These services 
enable semiconductor manufacturers to gain 
efficiencies through the increased use of silicon 
test wafers within their production processes. 03 Annual report and accounts 2010  Pure Wafer plc
Our process

wafers 	 involves 	 the 	 following 	 k ey 	 stages:
› 	 	 Inspection	of	the	wafers	for	defects	and	
classification	by	type	of	contaminant	to	
be	removed
› 	 	 Submersion	in	a	precise	mix	of	chemicals	
appropriate	to	remove	the	contaminant
› 	 	 Assessment	of	flatness	and	correction	
of	defects	using	P ure	W afer ’s	advanced	
polishing	processes
› 	 	 Cleaning	and	dr ying
› 	 	 F inal	quality	inspection	and	packaging

The	semiconductor	industr y	transition	to	300mm	wafers	is	now	
well	advanced.	In	order	for	manufacturers	to	continue	to	increase	
functionality	at	a	reduced	cost,	the	industr y	has	sought	to	increase	
the	size	of	wafers	on	which	semiconductors	are	manufactured.	
300mm	wafer	processing	now	represents	the	fastest	growing	
area	of	the	semiconductor	industr y .
However ,	wafer	reclaim	is	a	highly	specialised	and	technically	
sophisticated	process.	Only	a	few	companies	worldwide	are	
able	to	meet	the	exacting	standards	required	by	semiconductor	
manufacturers	for	the	reclaim	of	300mm	wafers,	of	which	
P ure	W afer	is	one.

 08 AMEC plc  annual report and accounts 2013
Before joining AMEC, I talked to those who knew 
the company well. They spoke of many things I now 
recognise myself: high-quality people, expertise, strong 
customer relationships. But back then there was no 
coherent vision. That has now changed and since 2006 
we have been on a journey of improvement, increasing 
margins and improving earnings per share fivefold
1
. 
We have generated substantial amounts of cash and 
have spent over £700 million on acquisitions to support 
growth and returned some £1 billion to shareholders. 
It’s a strong history – but I am never satisfied. 
By implementing our Vision 2015 strategy we have 
strengthened our position in our four core markets, 
improved our geographic footprint and enhanced the 
capabilities we provide to our customers. We need to do 
more of this as we look to 2015 and beyond and I believe 
the acquisition of Foster Wheeler would support this goal.
Let me mention our 2013 results then focus on some 
examples of our progress towards Vision 2015. 
2013 results
As expected, 2013 was a year of contrasts in our markets. 
Our business model and reputation for excellent delivery 
protected us from much of the uncertainty and helped 
ensure that underlying revenues
2
 (excluding incremental 
procurement) were broadly flat. Adjusted earnings per 
share
3
 of 87.2 pence were 11 per cent higher and we 
converted this to cash at an impressive rate, with cash 
conversion of 99 per cent

. Ian McHoul, CFO, discusses 
the results in more detail on page 39.
Our customers
Our vision is that by sustainably delivering excellence, 
we inspire trust and loyalty in our customers. We are 
looking to create strong customer relationships, 
becoming and remaining a trusted partner .
We have built an impressive pedigree of US solar projects. 
Sempra US Gas & Power is one example of a new 
customer in 2013 and the solar project they awarded 
us is seven times larger than any we have completed 
to date, at 250MW. 
In contrast, we have been working with KNPC since 
2007 providing project engineering and management 
services (PEMS) at their refineries. In 2013 following 
a competitive tender , we re-won the contract with 
an enhanced scope. We are also providing project 
management consultancy (PMC) services for KNPC 
on a new refinery at Al Zour , Kuwait.
 The combination of AMEC and 
Foster Wheeler would be financially 
and strategically attractive. I believe 
it would be a compelling proposition 
for our shareholders, customers 
and employees.”

Our people
Many people join us to create a lifelong career; others 
work on specific projects. Our business in Europe 
recruited almost 6,000 people in 2013, despite resource-
constrained markets, to work on projects such as the 
hook-up and commissioning of ConocoPhillips’ new 
Jasmine facilities in the North Sea. Elsewhere, we have 
also recruited successfully for project ramp-ups in the 
Middle East. This effort – planning, identifying, recruiting 
and training people – is crucial to our success, ensuring 
we deliver the skills our customers need, at the time they 
need them. 
Our employees tell us there are three main reasons why 
they join and stay with us: opportunity , excellence and 
belonging. These are the core of our employer brand 
‘Why AMEC’, which is also recognised externally . In 2013 
we were ranked one of the top 20 ‘most in demand’ 
employers by LinkedIn UK. Our history is reflected in 
the composition of our employee base. The commitment 
we formalised in 2013, to diversity and inclusion, is an 
important stepping stone on our journey to become 
more global.
Never compromising on safety is one of our four core 
values. In 2013 TRCFR
5
 and AIFR
6
 both reduced again, 
to 0.26 and 1.56 respectively per 200,000 exposure hours. 
It is clear we cannot afford complacency . Our target for 
lost time incidents (L TIs) is zero yet we had 14 L TIs in 
the year. 
We continue to work closely in and for our local 
communities, including donating over £400,000 to 
match the fundraising efforts of our employees. 
Our markets
We said at the start of 2013 that we anticipated ongoing 
economic uncertainty and more challenging conditions 
in certain areas and that is exactly what we found. 
The downturn in global mining markets has been widely 
reported and our oil sands business in Canada has come 
off the peaks seen in 2010 as the Kearl project moves 
into production. In contrast, our conventional oil & gas 
business has seen good growth, led by the UK North Sea 
and boosted by new contract wins in the Middle East. 
Our US renewable business has been strong, particularly 
in solar , and further growth is expected in 2014. There 
have been positive signs around UK nuclear new build, 
though AMEC is unlikely to see significantly more activity 
until the EU completes its review. 
We have deliberately diversified our business across 
energy and power markets and this remains our strategy .
Our global reach
Our simplified geographic organisation has now been 
in place for a little over 12 months. More important than 
the cost savings are the increased collaboration and 
new growth opportunities being created. For example, 
in October we were awarded the front end loading study 
for Vale’ s underground mine at Voisey Bay in Canada. 
This is our first major contract for this customer; 
expands our position in underground mining, an 
objective of our Vision 2015 strategy; and is being 
worked on collaboratively by employees from our 
power and E&I businesses, from Canada and the US.
Vision 2015: a snapshot
We first announced our Vision 2015 growth strategy 
in late 2009:
  By focusing on our customers, our people and 
delivering the AMEC Way , we want to create 
sustainable growth
  Our key measure of success is the improvement 
in earnings per share between 2009 and 2015. 
Earnings per share3
87.2p +11%
This compares with 49.6 pence in 2009 when we started

Chief Executive’ s review continued
Our global reach continued
We still need to create a sustainable position in our 
Growth Regions. Our business in the Middle East 
performed strongly in 2013 and ended the year with 
a record order book, but conditions elsewhere were 
more difficult. Creating a greater scale is one of our 
objectives from an acquisition such as Foster Wheeler. 
Let me touch on Foster Wheeler here. We believe this 
acquisition could significantly accelerate implementation 
of our growth strategy . Its mid and downstream oil & gas 
business is complementary to our existing upstream 
position and is well positioned to gain from the growth 
anticipated in North America. Its position in Growth 
Regions is also good and would provide us with more 
scale in the region. As is shown in more detail on page 3, 
the financial characteristics of the deal are also expected 
to be very attractive. 
We would expect this deal to close in the second half 
of 2014. 
Our expertise
We continue to work right across the life cycle of our 
clients’ assets and believe our customers increasingly 
value the flexibility this offers. Again, let me pick out 
just a couple of examples.
We have seen recent strength in brownfield operations 
on projects such as the Montrose BLP contract for 
T alisman where work is due to be completed in 2016. 
We are exploring how to export this capability from 
the UK North Sea to other parts of the world. 
We acquired qedi in 2011 for its expertise in specialist 
completions and commissioning services. Since then 
the business has grown threefold and in 2013 contributed 
to projects for BP , TAQA, GDF SUEZ and many others. 
Our way of working
We are continually looking for improvements in how 
we work. 
Our new shared services centre in the Philippines was 
officially opened in December , when, in line with local 
custom, a priest blessed the building. As well as 
consolidating finance and HR administrative activities 
for our Growth Regions business, our global IT support 
will be run from this office. 
Our High Value Delivery Centre (HVDC) in Jakarta has 
been working closely with offices elsewhere in the world, 
including with Aberdeen on an FPSO vessel conversion 
for one of our clients. The client gained from the use of 
multiple time zones and a lower overall cost and has 
subsequently awarded us more work. Elsewhere our 
office in Shanghai has been supporting the delivery of 
work on the Oyu T olgoi mine in Mongolia, working with 
colleagues in Vancouver .
Our sustainable approach is a part of what differentiates 
us in the eyes of our customers. In 2013 we have made 
further improvements in the reporting of our carbon 
emissions (see page 26).
2015 and beyond
I am proud of what we have achieved so far and thank 
all my colleagues for the hard work and contribution 
they have made to AMEC’ s success. 
But as I said previously , we can’t stand still. 
The proposed acquisition of Foster Wheeler is an exciting 
prospect. Irrespective of what happens about acquisitions, 
we are focused on collaboration, continual improvement 
and growth within our markets. That’ s how we will 
achieve sustainable success to 2015 – and beyond.

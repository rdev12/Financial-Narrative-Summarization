 “Further investment
has enabled closer
co-operation between
Asia and the UK. ”
Overview
These results mark a year of
consolidation, in which several
important customer relationships
were brought to fruition, and 
new initiatives were undertaken
which will maintain growth of the
business in future.
Global markets are becoming
increasingly fast moving and
demanding, and China is emerging
as one of the world’s major
economies. Stadium is well placed
to capitalise on these market 
trends, with flexible manufacturing
operations, well developed design
and engineering capabilities and 
a highly skilled workforce.
2003 also marked a return to
increased volatility in foreign
exchanges, with the US dollar
weakening approximately 10%
against Sterling, and approximately
20% against the Euro. Whilst 
these movements tend to increase
the competitiveness of Stadium 
Asia against UK and European
manufacturers, they have an adverse
impact on the translation of its
results for group reporting purposes.
This increased volatility, coupled
with the increasing importance to
the group of our Asian operations,
has led to a change in accounting
policy on the translation of results 
of overseas operations. These have
been translated at average rates 
of exchange prevailing during the
year, whereas previously results
were translated at closing rates 
of exchange.
Results and dividend
Profit before tax was £1.9m,
compared with a loss of £1.3m for
last year. Profits from continuing
activities before exceptional items
and goodwill amortisation increased
by 49% to £1.9m from £1.3m.
Group turnover on continuing
operations was similar at £34.9m,
although Stadium Asia experienced
an increase of 15% to £14.5m,
equivalent to growth of 22% 
when stated in local currency.UK
Electronics suffered a corresponding
decline from £13.8m to £10.6m.
Earnings per share of 5.2 pence
compared with a loss per share of
2.8 pence last year. Pre exceptional
earnings per share rose by 26% 
to 5.3p from 4.2p.
Borrowings were reduced by 
£2.9m to £1.6m, with operating
cash flow of £2.4m being
supplemented by the receipt of
£1.0m of deferred consideration.
This enabled the paydown of bank
debt ahead of the scheduled due
date, and year end gearing of 12%.
The strength of this performance
has enabled the board to propose 
an increase in the total dividend 
to 2.9 pence per share. The final
dividend of 1.95 pence will be paid
on 4 May 2004 to shareholders on
the register as at 2 April 2004.
Chief Executive’s review
STADIUM GROUP plc

Annual Report and Accounts 2003 Operating margins improved to 6.1%
(2002: 3.2%). This favourable trend
was mainly a result of beneficial
changes to product and customer
mix, with a higher contribution 
from recently converted original
equipment contracts and lower
reliance on more traditional
commodity products.
Further development and investment
in production capacity in China,
including expansion of surface mount
placement capabilities, have enabled
closer co-operation between Asia
and the UK. Our UK based 
sales, product development and
engineering infrastructure is 
now supplemented by Chinese
manufacture which provides a
credible offer to customers for 
more complex applications.
During the second half of the 
year our second Chinese facility,
STMC Limited, was fitted out.
Regulatory formalities to begin
transacting domestic sales in 
China are complete, and we expect
the operation to begin making a
small contribution in 2004. Sales
from our UK facilities reduced to
£10.6m. A high proportion of the
business which remains UK sourced
is sold into industrial markets, and
we expect to see greater stability 
in coming months.

“Confidence in the
delivery of further
growth. ”
Turnover was maintained despite
challenging markets by taking an
assertive approach to maintaining
and building market share.
Production capacity utilisation for
larger mouldings was high, whilst
new channels for the cost effective
introduction of smaller products
factored from partners in the 
Far East region were introduced.
Current trading and prospects
Strong customer demand at the 
end of 2003 has continued into
2004, and sales are well ahead of
the corresponding period last year.
We continue to attract new
customers and enquiries at an
increasing rate, giving us confidence
in the delivery of further growth in
the current year and beyond.

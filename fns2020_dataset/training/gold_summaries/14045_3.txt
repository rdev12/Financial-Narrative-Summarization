Chairman’s Statement
Our substantial order book and pipeline
of opportunities together with our
proven ability to deliver innovation and
efficiency savings to our customers,
support our expectation of continued
strong performance going forward.
Financial results
I am pleased to report on another year of
strong financial performance. Revenue grew
by 11.1% to £3,124m, Adjusted profit
before tax (Adjusted PBT) rose by 17.9%
to £145.3m and Adjusted earnings per
share grew 19.5% to 22.20p. The Adjusted
PBT margin increased from 4.4% to 4.7%,
as we continue to benefit from efficiency
improvements and management of our
contract portfolio. Profit before tax rose by
18.8% to £136.1m and earnings per share
was 20.7% higher at 20.49p. We delivered
another good cash performance, with free
cash flow of £94.2m, and have a strong
funding position, with £900m of committed
debt facilities, the majority of which are not
repayable until 2013.
In December, we were included for the
first time in the FTSE 100 index, which
comprises the UK’s 100 largest
listed companies.
2008 was another year of strong performance
for Serco, with good growth across our markets
and sectors. We also made significant progress
in developing new markets and enhancing
our capabilities.

Dividend
Serco’s policy is to increase the total
dividend each year broadly in line with the
increase in underlying earnings. The Board
has proposed a final dividend of 3.52p per
share, representing an increase on the
2007 final dividend of 16.6% and bringing
the total dividend for the year to 5.00p,
representing growth of 17.6%. The final
dividend will be paid on 20 May 2009
to shareholders on the register on
6 March 2009.
Delivering sustainable growth
Economic conditions in 2008 were
challenging for governments, companies
and citizens alike and whilst no one can
expect to be immune to these conditions,
Serco has once again demonstrated the
resilience of its business model.
Budget constraints are fuelling demand for
efficient and cost-effective public services,
as governments balance their investment in
stimulating economies with the requirement
to control national debt. Meanwhile, citizens
increasingly demand better solutions to
global challenges such as security,
congestion and environmental issues.
The role of the private sector in supporting
governments in tackling these issues has
become an established part of the solution.
The Julius Review, commissioned for the
UK Government, revealed that the public
services industry employs more than
1.2 million people in the UK, generates
£45bn of value per year and has significant
export potential. Our growing capabilities
mean that we are now able to address
a broader range of these opportunities
across a larger number of geographies
and sectors.
We continue to grow our capabilities both
organically, by investing within our existing
business, and by acquisition. In addition to
a substantial number of new contract wins
and extensions in 2008, we took a significant
step in our international development by
acquiring SI International, Inc., a provider of
information services, technology, and
network solutions in the very large US
federal government services market. We
also established a presence in the Indian
market, where we see strong growth
opportunities, through the acquisition of
InfoVision, a BPO company serving the
domestic market.
Effective management of risk
As well as maximising opportunities for
growth within our business, a key element
in delivering sustainable performance
is to manage risks in bids and existing
operations. We do this through the Serco
Management System, our robust system
of governance and internal control which
covers all aspects of our business and is
overseen by the Board.
We carefully select new bidding
opportunities and assess each bid’s
financial profile, risks, visibility, place within
our portfolio and our ability to deliver
excellent service. We take a similar
approach to our existing contracts with
regular assessment of performance
and risks, which is reviewed on
a continuous basis.
We also constantly look to improve our
processes. Given challenging global
economic conditions in 2008, it was
appropriate that we incorporated our risk
management processes into a broader
framework that encompasses the resilience
of the Group as a whole, providing us with
further confidence in the visibility and
control environment within our business.
Our people
Finally, I would like to thank all Serco
employees for their tremendous efforts over
the year, and to welcome to the business
those who joined us in 2008. It is the spirit
of innovation of our people and their
commitment to the delivery of excellent
service that distinguishes us, and supports
our confidence in the future.

excellent service that distinguishes us, and

Chief Executive’s Review
Introduction
Animalcare Group plc has delivered 
a strong performance for the year 
to 30
th 
June 2013. This noteworthy 
result has been achieved during 
a year of transition; transition that 
has placed Animalcare in a strong 
position to grow and succeed into 
the next decade. Executive and 
senior management changes have 
been completed alongside a long-
anticipated change of premises, 
both of which give us capacity for 
the future.
In addition, the Group is firmly in the 
transition to a new strategy to bring 
enhanced generic products into 
the development pipeline which will 
deliver protectable and sustainable 
commercial benefits over the 
long-term.

The Group is firmly in the transition to a new 
strategy to bring enhanced generic products 
into the development pipeline which 
will deliver protectable and sustainable 
commercial benefits over the long-term.
Business Overview
The UK companion animal 
medicines market decreased by 
0.02% in the year to December 
2012, making our performance all 
the more significant (reference: 
National Office of Animal Health, 
www.NOAH.co.uk). Output from the 
current in-house and EU partner 
pipelines has continued to drive 
growth with three launches in the 
period, of which the principal launch 
was the re-introduction of Buprecare 
‘single-dose’ ampoules.
Revenues derived from services 
marketed to pet owners on our 
microchip pet database, Anibase, 
continued to rise in the period. 
Microchip sales volumes were 
marginally ahead of management 
expectations despite competitive 
pressure. The Animal Welfare group 
continued to perform steadily in line 
with management expectations.
Animalcare launched three products 
in 2013 (Vitofyllin, Buprecare 
ampoules and Marbocare injection). 
A fourth product received its 
Marketing Authorisation in the 
last month of the financial year 
and will be launched in H1 of the 
current year. 
Licensed Veterinary Medicines
The importance of the contribution 
from new product launches is clear, 
of less obvious impact is the critical 
mass that has been achieved by 
launching such a range of new 
products. Animalcare now has a 
much more comprehensive range of 
companion animal pharmaceuticals 
in more therapeutic areas than 
10 years ago, giving its UK sales 
team greater significance in UK 
veterinary practices.
Since the launch of Benazecare 
in 2006, the first licensed generic 
veterinary pharmaceutical in the 
recent strategy, Animalcare has 
launched 17 further new products 
that have either been products of 
our highly successful new product 
development pipeline, collaboration 
projects with our EU partners 
or straightforward distribution 
opportunities from our EU partners.

Chief Executive’s Review continued
Vitofyllin (project Quattro), the first 
of the three products to be launched 
in the period, is a treatment for 
the symptoms of old age in dogs. 
Good sales have been achieved 
through the year exceeding our 
expectations in this £2m market. 
Whilst Animalcare is looking to grow 
its market share we also believe 
that there is potential to grow this 
market as the symptoms are often 
overlooked by owners and veterinary 
professionals alike.
A new, more robust manufacturer 
has been found for Buprecare 
ampoules and in December the 
product was relaunched on schedule 
following a successful registration 
process. Revenues from sales in the 
second half have been strong and in 
line with our expectations. Buprecare 
ampoules complement the multi-
dose presentation that was launched 
in the second half of last year (ended 
30
th 
June 2012). The two Buprecare 
products generated combined 
revenues in the UK of £0.9m in the 
year ended 30
th 
June 2013.
The third launch in the year was 
Marbocare injection (project Stone 
1), a codevelopement with one of 
our EU partners. It is used in the 
treatment of respiratory infections in 
cattle and pigs. Whilst not significant 
target species for Animalcare, this 
successful registration will allow us 
to develop this active ingredient into 
our core species market.
Companion Animal Identification
Continuing sales and marketing 
efforts which have significantly 
slowed the decline in microchips 
sales to 6% in the period are set 
to maintain a positive effect. Over 
3.5 million owners have their 
pets registered on our microchip 
database, Anibase. Improvements 
in the way we are able to market 
associated goods and services to 
these pet owners has allowed us to 
increase revenues and at improved 
margins as efficiencies have 
been achieved in operational and 
marketing activities.
Animal Welfare Products
The Animal Welfare product group 
is made up of a variety of product 
sub-groups. Half of this group’s 
revenue is generated from infusion 
accessories that complement the 
sale of our intravenous infusion 
fluids. The infusion accessories 
sub-group grew by 3% in the year to 
30
th 
June 2013. The remaining half 
is made up of unconnected legacy 
products that are increasingly difficult 
to differentiate from their competitor 
products. They also continue to 
require operational support. Most 
of these products are in decline 
and it is our strategy to selectively 
withdraw from these markets. During 
the year, the first of these products 
was discontinued from sale.

Operational Overview
Animalcare had outgrown its leased 
warehouse and offices some time 
ago. In March, after a programme 
of refurbishment, the business was 
moved to the new premises, still in 
the York area, with no disruption 
to trading. The new warehouse 
operation has approximately 70% 
more capacity than the old facility, 
allowing for the planned business 
growth to 2020 and beyond. 
The office move has allowed IT 
infrastructure to be upgraded 
resulting in a much more capable 
and robust system. Overall, our 
operations are now in good shape 
for the years ahead.
In January, the Company announced 
that Stephen Wildridge would leave 
the business in October 2013. In 
the intervening period he assumed 
the role of Director of Strategy and 
Business Development. In August 
2013 Karolyn Tapper joined the 
business as Director of Business 
Development. Karolyn has 19 years’ 
experience working in a global 
contract manufacturing company 
with experience in pharmaceutical 
formulation, project management 
and business development. There 
has been a thorough handover 
to ensure the momentum of new 
product development is maintained.
Also in August, Torben Orskov was 
promoted to Director of Technical 
and Regulatory Affairs. Torben is 
a qualified veterinary surgeon with 
10 years’ experience in companion 
and large animal practice before he 
joined Animalcare in 2006. Torben 
has been heavily involved in the 
technical and regulatory aspects of 
the product development pipeline.
Both appointments reflect our 
continued emphasis on the new 
product development strategy and 
more specifically the increasing 
importance of Project Sustain.
Future Developments
Animalcare will continue to launch 
undifferentiated generic licensed 
veterinary medicines from its 
in-house development pipeline, 
co-developed projects with our 
European partners or simple 
distribution products from our 
existing partners in Europe.
In July 2013, we launched 
an enhanced presentation of 
Phenoleptil, a product used in the 
prevention of epileptic seizures in 
dogs. Phenoleptil was originally 
launched in June 2011. The 
enhanced presentation makes 
accurate dosing of patients easier 
and will allow us to gain faster 
market penetration as it has practical 
prescribing advantages for the 
veterinary surgeon.
Two further products, one from our 
own development pipeline and one 
a distribution product, are in the final 
commercialisation planning stages 
for launch in Q2 of this year. Both 
products are for use in companion 
animal medicine.
Depending on the time required to 
fully develop the market for the three 
products outlined above we may also 
launch a fourth product in H2.
During this financial year we will 
be upgrading the software tools 
available to our sales team. We 
have identified a partner who will be 
able to enhance the management 
information we can derive from 
our sales data; as well as reducing 
the administrative work by the 
wider team.
We also expect to see significant 
progress on Project Sustain that 
will crystalise the work already 
undertaken. We forecast the first 
products to launch in 2017-18.
In addition, we expect to take the 
first steps in this period to expand 
the geographic footprint of territories 
in which Animalcare distributes 
outside the UK.

Outlook
In February, the UK Parliament 
announced that it will be 
compulsory for all dogs in England 
to be microchipped by April 2016. 
Furthermore, the Welsh Assembly 
has now announced that it will 
introduce similar legislation for 
implementation in March 2015. 
Whilst there will be some undoubted 
commercial opportunities as a 
result of this legislation, in the short 
to medium-term, it is not yet clear 
how the initial implementation will 
impact Animalcare. However, as 
a company selling microchips and 
also administering the Anibase pet 
database of over 3.5million pets and 
their owners, Animalcare remains in 
a strong position in this market for 
the medium-term after a potential 
initial disruptive period.
We have commented in previous 
reports that competition is strong 
in the Licensed Veterinary 
Medicines market, however, we 
have consistently outperformed 
the UK market and we believe this 
will continue.
Over the past seven years, since 
the launch of the first product 
from the Animalcare new product 
pipeline, the Group has achieved 
increased revenues and profitability. 
However, with this upside comes 
the requirement to invest further 
in the routine maintenance 
of the associated Marketing 
Authorisations. The number of 
Marketing Authorisation licences that 
Animalcare owns and therefore must 
maintain was 14 in 2003 rising to 
136 in 2013.
Having delivered a successful 
undifferentiated and differentiated 
generics strategy, the Company is 
moving into a period of investment 
for the future. We intend to invest 
more in research and development, 
particularly in enhanced generics, 
than we have to date. In this context, 
we expect limited growth in the 
coming 12 to 36 months, however 
this will put the foundations in 
place to deliver the next phase in 
our strategy.
As these projects are 
commercialised from 2017 onwards 
we believe the rewards will be 
significant and ensure the future 
growth and success of the Group.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Review of the Year
I am pleased to be able to report that Phoenix IT Group plc has 
continued to make good progress over the past year despite 
challenging trading conditions and a backdrop of economic 
slowdown. The Group has grown revenue and proﬁ t and this,
combined with improvements in working capital and cash 
management, has provided the base for further increases in 
shareholder value. 
Results
Group revenues increased by 9.7% to £253.2m (2008: £230.8m)
and operating proﬁ t before non-recurring items and
amortisation of acquired intangibles increased by 8.0% to 
£35.7m (2008: £33.0m). On a like-for-like basis, adjusting for
the effect of the timing of the ICM acquisition, revenue and 
operating proﬁ t increased by 3.8% and 3.1% respectively.
Excluding non-recurring items and amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 
to 26.3p (2008: 24.1p) and diluted earning per share were
14.2p (2008: 14.6p). Proﬁ t from operations (after amortisation
of acquired intangibles) decreased by 1.8% to £23.0m
(2008: £23.4m). The Group has continued to be cash generative 
during the year reducing its net debt (including ﬁ nance leases)
by £14.5m to £88.4m (2008: £102.9m).  
Dividend
The Board recommends a proposed ﬁ nal dividend of 4.2p per
share (2008: 3.65p) which, if approved at the Annual General 
Meeting, will be paid on 9 October 2009 to shareholders on the 
register at 18 September 2009. Combined with the interim 
dividend of 2.1p per share paid on 6 April 2009, this would make 
a total dividend per share of 6.3p (2008: 5.48p), an increase of 
15%. It is the Board’s current intention to increase future 
dividends broadly in line with earnings.
Board Changes
John Sussens, who joined the Board in 2004 as a Non-Executive 
Director, wished to cut back on his commitments and therefore 
stepped down from his role on 14 August 2008. Jeremy Stafford 
stepped down from the Board on 21 November 2008 and Nick 
Robinson returned to the role of Chief Executive. I would like to 
reiterate our thanks to John and Jeremy and we are grateful for 
their contributions to the Group. 
In addition to these changes, we have appointed two new 
Non-Executive Directors to the Board. David Garman joined the 
Board on 1 December 2008 and brings extensive Listed 
Company experience, including Associated British Foods plc, 
TDG plc and Carillion plc. David Warnock joined the Board on 
23 January 2009. He has long experience of the Investment 
Management industry, latterly at Aberforth Partners LLP. 
I am conﬁ dent that the experienced Board combined with a
strong and focused management team will continue to drive 
our business forward and further enhance our position in our 
chosen markets. 
Employees
This has been another year of good performance by the Group 
and these results have been delivered by our staff in a year 
overshadowed by a challenging economic environment. On 
behalf of the Board and the Shareholders I would like to thank 
all our staff for their hard work and support during the year and 
for delivering this successful performance.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at the Group’s 
registered ofﬁ ce, Technology House, Hunsbury Hill Avenue,
Northampton on Friday 31 July 2009 at 10.30 a.m.
Summary
The strategy of the Group has not changed and we continue
to focus on delivering proﬁ table organic growth, supported
by excellent service and a strong customer focus. With the 
integration programme now completed and ﬁ rmly behind
us, the Group remains well placed in each of its chosen markets 
and enters the new ﬁ nancial year with a robust order book
and strong sales pipeline. Our close relationships with our 
customers will allow the Group to gauge market conditions
and to take advantage of and gain new business where 
possible. Management remain focused on being able to 
respond to changing market conditions and being able
to reduce operational gearing in response to weakened 
economic conditions.

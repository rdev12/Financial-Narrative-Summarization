Expense growth reflected significant investment in organic growth
across the business and performance related costs.
•
In UK Retail Banking accelerated income momentum drove very
strong profit growth.
•
UK Banking delivered a further three percentage points underlying
improvement in the cost:income ratio; the six percentage point
target for 2005-2007 has been achieved a year ahead of schedule;
we still target a further two percentage point improvement in 2007.
•
Outstanding growth in Barclays Capital was driven by continued
expansion of the business, the success of past investment and the
focus of our client driven model.
•
Barclays Global Investors delivered another year of excellent
growth. Assets under management increased US$301bn to
US$1.8trn.
•
Absa’s first full year contribution was well ahead of the acquisition
business plan.
•
Barclaycard profits were affected by industry-wide impairment
pressures in UK cards and unsecured loans; UK consumer credit
performance is beginning to improve.
•
Capital ratios strengthened through retained earnings and active
balance sheet management; the Tier 1 capital ratio rose to 7.7%.
•
We delivered a total shareholder return for 2006 of 25%.
•
Approximately 50% of profits came from outside the UK.
“Barclays had an excellent year in 2006. We delivered outstanding performance in Barclays Capital and Barclays Global Investors. Momentum has
accelerated in UK Retail Banking and Absa has outperformed our acquisition business plan delivering very strong growth. Conditions in UK cards
and consumer loans were difficult but Barclaycard UK consumer credit performance is beginning to improve. We are well positioned to deliver
further growth in the years ahead.”

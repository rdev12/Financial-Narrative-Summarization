Annual Report and Accounts 2015
The strong performance in 2015 has once again 
highlighted the strength, depth and diversity that the 
Group now has in terms of geography, discipline and 
revenue streams. 
STRENGTH, DEPTH  
AND DIVERSITY
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT
Review of operations
The Group now has over 2,900 staff 
spanning 24 countries, a balanced footprint 
covering both established and emerging 
recruitment markets including the industry’s 
strongest emerging market footprint in the 
fast developing Asia region and a healthy 
blend of permanent, contract and interim 
recruitment businesses.
The evolution of recruitment process 
outsourcing (RPO) is arguably the biggest 
current trend impacting the global 
recruitment industry, with Nelson Hall 
predicting RPO to grow by 15% per year  
until 2019. In Resource Solutions we have  
a market-leading business in this space  
that complements our core recruitment 
businesses and also enables the Group to 
work with clients to deliver a truly end-to-end 
and global resourcing solution. 
Asia Pacific (41% of net fee income)
Revenue was £285.1m (2014: £251.4m) and 
net fee income increased by 6% (10%*) to 
£96.3m (£99.8m*) (2014: £90.5m). This 
delivered an operating profit increase of 23% 
(21%*) to £12.9m (£12.7m*) (2014: £10.5m).
In Japan, the Group’s most profitable 
business, we further consolidated our 
market-leading position, growing net fee 
income strongly across both Tokyo and 
Osaka. In addition, our sponsorship of the 
‘Brave Blossoms’, Japan’s national rugby 
team further strengthened our profile in  
what is a very brand conscious market. 
Of our other large and well-established 
markets, Hong Kong had a very good year, 
whilst growth was steady in mainland China 
and Malaysia. The market in Singapore  
was more challenging, particularly within 
financial services. 
Our emerging markets in Asia continued  
to go from strength to strength and it is 
particularly pleasing to report that all our 
offices in these newer markets are now 
profitable. Indonesia and Taiwan both more 
than doubled net fee income, whilst Vietnam 
and Thailand also produced excellent 
results, increasing net fee income by  
more than 90% and 55% respectively.
Our business in Australia had a solid year, 
despite challenging market conditions, 
delivering four consecutive quarters of single 
digit net fee income growth and a significant 
increase in operating profit. 
Resource Solutions in Asia continues to 
grow well, winning a number of new clients 
in both new markets and sectors.
UK (34% of net fee income)
Revenue was £403.4m (2014: £311.9m), net 
fee income increased by 13% to £80.4m 
(2014: £71.1m) and operating profit increased 
by 17% to £6.2m (2014: £5.2m).

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
DIRECTORS’ REPORT STRATEGIC REPORT FINANCIALS
Recruitment activity levels across both 
permanent and contract recruitment were 
strong during the first three quarters of the 
year, delivering broad based growth across 
both London and the regions. However, 
permanent recruitment activity slowed 
noticeably during the fourth quarter, 
particularly across the financial services 
market. Notwithstanding the change in 
sentiment we saw in the fourth quarter,  
the UK delivered good net fee income and 
operating profit growth, with activity levels 
highest across commerce finance and legal 
in London and Manchester and Milton 
Keynes in the regions. A new office was 
opened in St Albans in the first half of  
the year to further develop our regional  
office network.
Resource Solutions had a strong year, 
winning a number of new clients and 
delivering a significant increase in net fee 
income. Investment has continued in both 
headcount and global infrastructure, 
including the growth of client sourcing 
centres in Jacksonville, Johannesburg  
and Manchester. 
Europe (20% of net fee income)
Revenue was £112.7m (2014: £106.4m)  
and net fee income increased 6% (16%*) to 
£46.3m (£51.0m*) (2014: £43.8m) producing 
a 53% increase in operating profit to £3.3m 
(£4.3m*) (2014: £2.2m).
Market conditions across the Eurozone 
trended positively throughout 2015. Our 
businesses in the Netherlands and Belgium 
both delivered strong performances across 
permanent and contract recruitment, whilst 
Ireland and Spain continued the positive 
progress we have seen over the past two 
years. A new office was opened in Barcelona 
to further grow our presence across the 
Spanish market. 
In France, our largest business in the region, 
contract performed well throughout the year, 
whilst encouragingly we also began to see 
an upturn in permanent recruitment activity 
during the fourth quarter.
Across Switzerland and Germany we made 
senior management changes during the year 
and are already seeing early signs of an 
improvement in business performance.
Other International (5% of net fee income)
Revenue was £11.5m (2014: £9.9m) and  
net fee income increased by 16% (11%*) to 
£11.5m (£11.0m*) (2014: £9.9m) producing  
a doubling of operating profit to £0.7m 
(£0.3m*) (2014: £0.3m).
Other International comprises the US, South 
Africa, the Middle East and Brazil. In the US, 
our office in San Francisco continues to 
benefit from the strength of Silicon Valley, 
whilst in New York our commerce finance 
business in particular performed well.  
In the Middle East, our business in Dubai 
continued to perform strongly and now has  
a diversified offering covering legal, financial 
services and commerce finance. Market 
conditions in both South Africa and Brazil 
have been challenging.
Current trading and outlook
The global macro-economic backdrop 
became noticeably more uncertain towards 
the end of 2015 and had an impact on time 
to hire and client and candidate confidence. 
Looking ahead, whilst mindful of the ongoing 
global market uncertainty, we believe that the 
strength, depth and diversity the Group now 
has in terms of geography, discipline and 
revenue streams ensures that we are well 
positioned for the future. Our expectations  
for the full year remain unchanged.

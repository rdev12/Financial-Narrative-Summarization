  “THE FINANCIAL YEAR TO  
31 MA Y 2016 (FY16) REPRESENTS  
A YEAR OF CONTINUED GOOD 
PROGRESS IN OUR TRANSITION  
TO A MUL TI-FRANCHISE,  
SELF-PUBLISHING COMPANY .”
DAVID GAMMON
Non-Executive Chairman
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
For the first time substantially all our 
revenue has come from self-published 
titles: Elite Dangerous and Planet Coaster  
(in Alpha). We have transformed a 
business-to-business enterprise into  
a business-to-consumer organisation  
in the space of two years.
In FY17 , we will launch our second franchise, 
Planet Coaster , and as a result will complete 
our strategic transition to self-publishing 
multiple revenue generating franchises.
As part of this transition and to continue the 
preparation of the business for long-term 
success, we will continue to develop, evolve 
and invest in our organisational structure 
and facilities. This will provide the right 
platform as we endeavour to further the 
success of our franchises and continue to 
grow their number.
We believe we are building the right 
management teams, organisation and 
infrastructure to be able to effectively 
create, develop, market and sell even  
more distinct franchises aimed at  
different audience segments.

pre-orders at end

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2016 On behalf of all shareholders, I take  
this opportunity to thank our employees 
and advisors for their amazing skill, 
professionalism and dedication.
I would also like to pay tribute to the 
support and experience Jonathan Milner 
brought to our Board during his period as 
an NED. Jonathan joined the Board pre-IPO 
in order to lend his weight and experience 
to the transfer from a private company to 
an AIM quoted company. That work has 
now been completed and I am delighted to 
welcome Charles Cotton as our new NED 
and Jonathan’s replacement. Charles has  
a successful worldwide track record in 
high-growth technology companies and  
his experience will be invaluable as we 
continue to build the organisation.
During FY16 we further developed  
both Elite Dangerous and Planet Coaster 
franchises and recruited new people into 
the organisation. In FY17 we expect to  
start seeing the results of these efforts.

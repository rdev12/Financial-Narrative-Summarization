OUR ASSETS
Weatherly’s Central Operations, 
Matchless and Otjihase, reopened 
in 2011 and produced 5086 tonnes 
in financial year 2014 with the 
highest production being seen in 
the final quarter. These established 
mines are cashflow positive and 
continue to increase in production 
whilst there has been a decline in 
sustaining costs due to the recent 
implemented initiatives. The plan is to 
progressively increase production to 
a rate of 7,000t of copper per annum. 
Management is also planning for 
the regional consolidation of other 
mines in the Otjihase region.
UNDERGROUND COPPER MINES TSCHUDI OTHER PROJECTS 
Weatherly’s Open Pit Mine project 
at Tschudi is fully funded with 
production expected in the second 
quarter of 2015. Tschudi has a mine 
life of 11 years and a confirmed 
JORC ore reserve of 22.7 million 
tonnes of ore at a grade of 0.95% 
copper. Tschudi will produce 
approximately 17,000 tonnes per 
annum when at full capacity.
Weatherly has two projects on 
granted Mining Licences, Tsumeb 
West and Tsumeb Tailings, and the 
prospect area EPL 132A. Weatherly 
has also strategically invested 
25% in the AIM listed China Africa

focused on the development of the 
lead/zinc project at Berg Aukas 
in Northern Nambia, estimated to 
produce 250,000 tonnes of both 
lead and zinc over 10 years.
 
Projects 
Weatherly’s producing mines, 
Matchless and Otjihase, are 
conveniently located near the  
capital Windhoek which allows  
for easy transport links.  
 
The development projects, Tschudi 
and the Tsumeb West and Tailings, 
have a strategic proximity to the 
town of Tsumeb, known locally as the 
‘gateway to the north’ of Namibia.

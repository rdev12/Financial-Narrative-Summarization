PRODUCT AREAS
Chamberlin operates across five locations in the 
UK. The Foundry Division specialises in technically 
demanding castings in complex shapes and in 
specialist metallurgies.
GLOBAL SALES
Engineering activity outside of the UK is a key  
driver of demand.
Work is allocated across its three foundry sites 
based on size and metallurgy as follows:
◗ ◗ Light castings based in Walsall produces 
castings up to 5kg in grey iron;
◗ ◗ Medium castings based in Leicester produce 
5kg to 100kg castings in a wide variety of iron 
alloys;
◗ ◗ Heavy castings based in Scunthorpe make 
100kg and 6 tonnes castings again in a wide 
variety of iron grades.
The two engineering businesses supply to 
regulated markets operating from two sites in  
the West Midlands.
Approximately 70% of output is ultimately 
exported. Direct exports account for 30% of 
output with our customers located in Europe, 
America and Asia. Indirect exports, where 
Chamberlin businesses supply products to 
UK-based equipment manufacturers whose 
products are then shipped worldwide, account 
for approximately 40% of our output. Against this 
30% of sales are driven by demand from the UK 
economy. Global demand for engineered products 
is strong and our UK customers, which include 
companies such as Siemens, Howden, CAT, JCB 
and Tata Steel, are typically leaders in their sectors.

Other major off-road vehicle manufacturers 
are now turning to us to aid in the design and 
manufacture of cast versions of their critical 
components that are currently manufactured as 
complex, heavy fabrications. By using specialist 
ADI material we are able to produce castings that 
exceed the strength of the current steel fabrications 
at a considerably lower weight with the added 
advantage of increased wear resistance extending 
the service life.
CASE STUDY
PRODUCT INNOVATION  
WITH OUR CUSTOMERS  
WINS NEW BUSINESS
A new customer saw 
an opportunity in the 
market for a new type of 
large ventilation blower 
that would replace 
the need for oil and 
gas refineries to buy 2 
smaller units. 
CASE STUDY
TURBOCHARGERS - LEICESTER
Chamberlin & Hill 
Castings has a proven  
track record as one of  
the few European 
foundries capable of 
supplying technically  
challenging turbocharger 
castings that consistently 
meet the automotive 
industry’s exacting 
standards.
As a complement to the existing range of products 
made at our Walsall foundry, our Leicester facility 
is now manufacturing the “hot end” turbine 
cover for commercial diesel turbochargers. These 
castings have especially demanding dimensional 
requirements and have to be capable of operating 
Working in conjunction with our customer, our 
technical team designed a casting process capable 
of producing this world-first, highly complex blower.
Due to the size and weight of the moulding boxes 
involved, weighing in excess of 25 tonnes when fully 
loaded with sand, numerous production challenges 
were overcome. In particular we had to re-think 
the handling procedure of the moulding boxes and 
by splitting the moulding box depth in half and 
moulding the castings as three-part moulds we 
were successfully able to manufacture a 7.2 tonne 
casting assembly from moulds measuring 4m x 2.4m 
x 2m, the largest ever produced at RDC, including 
the largest core ever made.
Our customer was delighted with the end casting 
and the new ventilation blower is fully assembled 
and destined for a Russian oil refinery. As a result 
of this success we expect repeat orders in the 
forthcoming years.
under extreme conditions due to the increased 
operating temperatures of modern, fuel efficient 
engines. 
These parts can be manufactured in a wide range 
of alloys suitable for the differing, high temperature, 
demands of various applications. A range of 
designs, with single and twin exhaust volutes can 
be accommodated on the versatile mould lines, in 
weights ranging from below 5kg up to 30kg.
The commercial production of the hot end turbine 
cover has only been possible by utilising the 
automotive standard technical expertise built up 
at Walsall and building upon our existing strong 
relations with key customers.
Quick hitches
Chamberlin & Hill Castings is a long-standing 
supplier to the construction vehicle industry 
and has been manufacturing components and 
assemblies for this sector over many years. With 
the continuing drive in the market for improved 
performance through optimised weight and 
strength, we have worked in partnership with 
our customers to convert many products from 
fabrications to castings. One such component is the 
quick hitch, where we now manufacture and supply 
the full range of sizes – from a 7kg version which 
is half the size of this page to the heavy duty 70kg 
version which is the size of a car engine.

CASE STUDY
EUROPE’S LARGEST URBAN 
SHOPPING CENTRE CHOOSES 
EXIDOR
Westfield Stratford 
City is Europe’s largest 
urban shopping centre, 
incorporating retail, 
office, leisure and 
hotel facilities, cost 
approximately £1.45bn 
to build and occupies  
1.9 million sq ft of retail 
and leisure space.
CASE STUDY
PETREL LED
LED technology was 
first used in lighting 
applications to provide 
a reliable, low power 
solution for signalling 
and indication purposes.
Over recent years there has been rapid 
development of the technology as several 
companies have developed high power LEDs 
for use in commercial and industrial lighting 
to compete with traditional lamps such as 
Fluorescent or Metal Halide. 
The site is on three levels, located close to the 
Olympic Stadium, and in planning the overall design 
of the centre, the architects have paid particular 
attention to visitor safety, particularly in the event 
of fire or when, in an emergency, it is paramount to 
evacuate the centre quickly and safely. 
As Exidor is the brand leader in UK hardware 
manufacturing, the architect was keen to work in 
conjunction with us and specifically selected the 
Exidor 200/300 Series Emergency Exit Hardware 
throughout the centre in order to confidently 
meet all of the stringent requirements called for in 
the exit door hardware specification.
Certified to European safety standards, the stylish 
and yet robust 200/300 Series has been designed 
to provide the optimum in safety and security. This 
coupled with our market reputation for reliability 
and proactively engaging with the product 
specifier places us in a strong position  
to win future prestige orders.
Petrel has already entered the LED market to 
provide customers with hazardous area lighting 
solutions that carry the benefits of longer 
life, lower maintenance and reduced energy 
consumption. Being solid state components LEDs 
are also less prone to damage and external shock, 
making them ideal for use in harsh environments.  
The technology continues to develop at a 
considerable pace and the second generation of 
Petrel LED products is already under development, 
with several new lines due for launch in 2013.

CASE STUDY
INVESTING FOR THE FUTURE
STRENGTHENING SUBSIDIARY 
MANAGEMENT
It has always been Chamberlin’s policy to employ 
the right people for the right job at the right time. 
With our growth strategy focused on utilising 
our technical expertise to generate new business 
development and fill the significant capacity in our 
business, Chamberlin has invested in customer-
focused commercial staff throughout the Group.
During the year three new Managing Directors 
for Russell Ductile Castings (“RDC”), Petrel and 
Exidor have been recruited to accelerate our 
new business development programme. They 
bring with them a strong sales and marketing 
background, significant experience of developing 
global export markets and a proven track record 
of leading business development programmes to 
deliver organic growth. 
Chamberlin & Hill castings has built upon the 
extensive experience of the automotive and 
engineering sectors possessed by its Managing 
Director with the recruitment of a Commercial 
Director in order to further drive sales growth 
at Walsall and Leicester and fully take advantage 
of the opportunities presented by the new 
turbocharger original equipment manufacturers 
(“OEMs”) that have entered the market and are 
building production capacity to supply 2014 and 
2015 requirements.
Our technical departments at Leicester, RDC and 
Petrel have all been strengthened by the arrival 
of new technical leadership which possesses 
the necessary expertise to satisfy the technical 
challenges faced by designing new products to 
meet customer demands.
This strengthened commercial and technical 
expertise within the group, coupled with our 
existing dedicated finance personnel means we 
are well placed to achieve our goals of generating 
top line sales growth as well as continuous 
operational development to improve efficiency 
and maintain tight cost controls, and therefore 
drive the Group’s profitability.
CHAMBERLIN GRADUATE 
SCHEME
For around 20 years there had been no national 
programme for the delivery of foundry specific 
skills and provision was now very patchy and 
inadequate. All foundries in the UK had issues 
relating to succession planning and sourcing 
relevant training and skills development. In 2012, 
Chamberlin recognised that there was an urgent 
need to increase the number of skilled castings 
engineers and craftsmen. 
“In doing this scheme we 
have gained professional, 
high level problem solvers 
with enthusiasm and a 
state of the art, fresh way 
of thinking.”
Our response was twofold: to work in conjunction 
with the industry professional body, the Institute of 
Cast Metals Engineers (“ICME”) to help create a 
casting specific foundation degree qualification, and 
to create a company graduate scheme to directly 
train the next generation of casting engineers. 
Our graduate scheme consisted of two different 
types of work placement. The first was a one-year 
work in industry placement for degree or post 
graduate students to gain industrial experience 
within the Group. The second was a two-year 
Professional Excellence & Leadership Development 
Programme for qualified graduates, with a view 
to permanent employment within the Group on 
successful completion of the programme. 
Four placement students were recruited, two for 
each type of placement and were put to work on 
projects in the Walsall and Leicester foundries. 
The placement projects involved production 
technology, process engineering, metallurgical 
control, subcontractor assessment, machining, 
lead time matrix, costs and budgeting & vendor 
management systems. 
In doing this scheme we have gained professional, 
high level problem solvers with enthusiasm and 
a state of the art, fresh way of thinking. The 
graduates have been heavily involved in key 
projects around the Group and are playing an 
active part in the new process implementation at 
Walsall as referred to in the Chairman’s statement. 
They have brought vitality, a new insight into age 
old problems and have had a positive effect on the 
overall culture of the business. 
The graduate scheme is something we will 
continue well into the future to ensure we have a 
steady supply of talent entering the Group.

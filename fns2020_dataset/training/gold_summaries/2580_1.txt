 This year has been all about delivering on the
strategy we set out last May. We are making
excellent progress against our targets.

Performance against strategic goals
During the past year we continued
our process of transforming BTG 
into a focused medical innovations
company. During a period of
considerable change, we have also
delivered strong financial results.
At the start of the year we set out 
our goals which were to:
> Position BTG for profitability and
sustainable growth
> Reduce costs 
> Realise value from the physical
sciences portfolio
> Progress the development and
partnering of Varisolve
®
> Continue to build value by
investing in the pipeline.
We achieved a pre-tax profit for the
year of £1.5m and, thanks to growing
recurring revenues and reduced
costs, we can build the business in 
a sustainable manner. Operating and
administrative costs reduced by 23%
from £31.6m to £24.3m and going
forward we anticipate these costs
will be below £21m. We have
realised value from several physical
sciences technologies including
WebNav, RFID, NQR and, at the end
of the year, Teleshuttle. This last
deal generated an immediate net
profit of £9.0m and also provides the
opportunity for additional significant
returns and brings to an end the
litigation activities around these
patents. We continued to invest 
in the pipeline, adding new
programmes and spending £9.1m 
on developing existing programmes,
including Varisolve
®
.
Building value in the pipeline
Six programmes were in-licensed
during the year, including a series 
of selective EP4 receptor antagonists
designed to treat pain in conditions
such as migraine headache. The 
lead compound, BGC20-1531, is 
in preclinical studies in preparation
for its first clinical study. Three
acquisitions were made for the 
Drug Repositioning portfolio, two
dermatology opportunities targeting
head lice and fungal infections, and 
a novel oral formulation for an
asthma product. Two earlier-stage
programmes were in-licensed for
the oncology portfolio.
Good progress was made in
developing existing programmes. 
In BTG’s pipeline, enrolment was
completed for the phase II part of the
phase I/II gastric cancer study 
of plevitrexed (BGC 9331), in which
19 additional patients are expected
to be dosed at the recommended
level for follow-on studies.
BGC20-1259 completed preclinical
development and commenced 
a phase I clinical study. To date, 
two cohorts of eight volunteers have
been treated with single ascending

doses. Dosing of the third cohort 
is expected to begin shortly, and
planning for a multiple ascending
dose study, which should begin
around mid-year, is under way.
BGC20-1259 is a unique
multifunctional compound designed
to act on the cognitive impairment,
associated psychiatric symptoms
such as depression and
neurodegenerative aspects of
Alzheimer’s disease.
A clinical proof of mechanism study
commenced with BGC20-0166, a
combination of two compounds shown
in preclinical studies to alleviate sleep
apnoea, a common condition in which
sleep is interrupted by cessation of
breathing and for which there is
currently no pharmacological
treatment. Ten patients have been
treated and all 36 planned patients
should have finished treatment by 
the end of the year .
In the current financial year we
anticipate the completion of the
plevitrexed phase I/II trial, phase I
for BGC20-1259 and the sleep
apnoea proof of mechanism study.
Several licensees made advances
with their development programmes.
Genzyme Corporation reported
positive interim efficacy results of 
a phase II trial comparing Campath
®
with interferon beta-1a in multiple
sclerosis. Genzyme anticipates
commencing phase III studies in MS
in the second half of 2006. 
TolerRx, Inc. showed in a phase II
trial in new-onset type-1 diabetes
that the monoclonal antibody TRX4
significantly reduced the trial
subjects’ requirements for insulin
over the 18 months of follow-up.
TRX4 was granted orphan drug
status for this indication, which
confers benefits including data
exclusivity if successfully approved. 
Cougar Biotechnology progressed 
its European phase I study of
abiraterone acetate, an inhibitor of
testosterone biosynthesis targeting
prostate cancer, and was granted
approval to commence clinical
studies in the US. Abiogen Pharma
completed phase I studies of ABIO
08-01 (BTG1640) and is currently
planning a phase II proof of concept
study in anxiety.
Varisolve
®
The IND for Varisolve
®
, BTG’s 
novel microfoam sclerosant
treatment for varicose veins, was
released from clinical hold and 
a phase II study protocol was
approved in the US in July 2005. 
BTG initiated new partnering
discussions from September with

on BGC20-1259 for
Alzheimer’s disease 
and BGC20-0166 for

> Six programmes 
in-licensed targeting
migraine headache, cancer,
dermatology, fungal
infections and a new
asthma drug formulation.
BTG’s pipeline has progressed well in the year,
with six programmes in-licensed and two
products entering human clinical studies.
Significant progress has also been made by
several licensees of our drug programmes.
Chief Executive Officer’s Review continued BTG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2006   05
a number of pharmaceutical,
specialist and medical device
companies. Discussions are
proceeding as expected.
In anticipation of securing a
commercialisation agreement and
following constructive dialogue with
the FDA, preparations for the agreed
phase II study have been progressed
so that it can start without delay to
the development timetable. Clinical
trial materials have been sourced
and eight varicose vein centres have
been identified to take part in the
study, which aims to show, using
sensitive MRI techniques, that the
presence of microbubbles in the
middle cerebral artery that may
result from treatment with Varisolve
®
does not cause subclinical damage. 
It is intended that a partner is signed
up prior to commencing the study
because there is a potential
regulatory pathway that allows 
phase II and phase III to overlap.
BTG has also continued to add value
to the Varisolve
®
programme through
further IP development, and patent
coverage now extends to 2024.
Capturing value from non-core assets
We are delighted with the progress
made over the year in monetising
some of the physical science assets
such as Teleshuttle, WebNav and
RFID. This work is ongoing and we are
seeking to sell or license a number of
other physical science technologies, in
fields such as telecommunications and
flash memory, over the medium term.
We will also continue to simplify the
portfolio and reduce costs by:
> Renegotiating terms on marginal
licences to reassign or return 
the IP
> Terminating contracts for 
non-viable assets 
> Managing our ventures
investments such that we can
maintain an economic and
management interest in key
assets while allowing dilution of
holdings in non-core assets.
Maintain cost control
Operating and administrative costs
reduced to £24.3m and we are
targeting ongoing costs of less than
£21m per annum. In achieving these
savings we incurred restructuring
charges of £3.7m this year. The
restructuring of the business is now
complete although focus remains 
on maintaining tight cost control
throughout the business.
Positioning BTG
In support of the new strategy and to
promote our capabilities to potential
partners we have increased our

presence at industry conferences
and partnering events. We moved
from the FTSE support services 
sub-sector to the biotechnology sub-
sector, and to help promote the new
strategy to a wider group of
international investors we appointed
Piper Jaffray as joint broker and
adviser alongside Credit Suisse.
Priorities for the year ahead
Our priorities for the year ahead
continue the work we have
commenced this year. The focus
continues to be to:
> Build value in the pipeline
through in-licensing and
development activities
> Secure a development and
commercialisation partner 
for Varisolve
®
> Capture full value from the
ongoing monetisation of 
non-core assets
> Maintain cost control across 
all areas of the business
> Further establish BTG within 
the industry as a credible and
preferred development and
licensing partner.

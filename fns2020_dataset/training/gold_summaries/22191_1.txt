 I am delighted that Cattles has delivered 
a strong set of results in 2006, with 
group proﬁt before tax for the year
increasing by 14.9% to £132.2 million
(2005: £115.1 million). 
This excellent performance continues 
the group’s record of double digit growth 
in both proﬁts and earnings per share, 
while at the same time maintaining stable
credit quality, customers’ arrears and 
bad debts. It also reﬂects the group’s long
standing commitment to, and many years’ 
experience in, the non-standard consumer
ﬁnance market.
Proﬁt before tax for the consumer credit
division has again increased signiﬁcantly
during the year by 15.5% to £136.1 million
(2005: £117.9 million). This success has
been achieved through a combination of
controlled volume and receivables growth
and careful management of credit quality.

DIRECT REPAYMENT AVERAGE 
ADVANCE (£000)
2005
2006
It is particularly pleasing that the division
has generated strong growth in its direct
repayment customer numbers during the
year, which have increased by 51,000 to
409,000 customers at 31 December 2006.
This represents signiﬁcant growth of 14.2%
in direct repayment customer numbers
during 2006, compared with 6.2% in 
the previous year. See Fig 1.
The number of new agreements written
during 2006 increased by 32,000 to
143,000 (2005: 111,000). The division 
also achieved a substantial reduction in 
the number of customers settling their
agreements early during the year, which 
fell by 10,000 to 35,000 customers (2005:
45,000), reducing the direct repayment 
early settlement ratio to 10% (2005: 13%).
Direct repayment loan volumes showed
strong growth in 2006, particularly during
the second half, increasing by 20.2% in the
year overall to £988 million (2005: £822
million). Direct repayment revenue increased
by 9.2% during the year to £506 million
(2005: £463 million). Following strong
growth in volumes and receivables during
2006, and as revenue is spread over the life
of a loan, the division is well placed to meet
its future revenue targets. 
The division’s overall average advance to
new direct repayment customers during 
the year increased by £500 to £3,800. 
Small unsecured personal loans increased to
around £1,900 (2005: £1,500), with secured
loans reducing slightly to around £8,700
(2005: £9,000). See Fig 2.
Hire purchase loans for second-hand cars
increased to around £6,200 (2005: £4,800),
reﬂecting continuing improvement in the
quality of vehicles ﬁnanced, particularly
those introduced by our own Welcome Car
Finance business and certain larger national
car retailers who have become part of 
the division’s distribution network. 
Direct repayment loans and receivables, 
after allowance for loan loss provisions,
increased by £381 million to £1.8 billion
(2005: £1.4 billion), an increase of 26.5%.
There has been no signiﬁcant change in
customers’ average outstanding balances
during the year, which remained at 
around £5,200 at 31 December 2006.
Deep understanding and experience 
of non-standard ﬁnance markets and
management of risk and operational 
control over underwriting and regulated
activities remains a primary focus of the
consumer credit division. The selection and
underwriting of prospective new customers
at the division’s central processing units
(CPUs) in Nottingham and Hull, supported
by continuing investment in people and
systems together with our local branch
network, have again enabled us to 
maintain stable credit quality.
In a period when many lenders announced
that they were experiencing higher loan
losses, the direct repayment loan loss ratio
improved to 7.4% (2005: 8.9%) of closing
net receivables. This continuing success
reﬂects the group’s signiﬁcant investment 
in customer selection processes over several
years and the continuing close customer
relationships maintained by our local 
branch staff.
Once a direct repayment loan has been
advanced by the CPU, most customers 
are contacted by a local Customer Account
Manager from their nearest branch, to begin
establishing a close working relationship.
Maintaining these relationships is a key part
of our arrears management strategy and is
the major role of our branch staff. 
At 31 December 2006, arrears levels were
7.4% (2005: 7.6%) of direct repayment
loans and receivables, slightly below our
long established target range of 8-10%. 
The division consistently operated within
this range until 2004, when the introduction
of improved credit scorecards, together 
with enhancements to our customer
selection technology and arrears
management techniques, brought arrears
below the target range. As previously
reported, we expect arrears to gradually
return to within the division’s target range.
CONSUMER CREDIT DIVISION
STRATEGY
Focus on the proﬁtable expansion of our 
consumer credit activities, underpinned by 
a policy of responsible and compliant lending 
while maintaining stable credit quality.

• New Phoenix IT customer relationship 
management system launched 10
Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2006
In this environment, interest rates available
to higher credit quality customers with
equity in their properties have fallen and
commissions payable to brokers for
introducing such business has increased.
Whereas we maintained our strategy of 
not offering large balance, low rate second
mortgage products, which do not meet 
our risk proﬁle. Competitive pressures 
eased in the second half of 2006, as a
consequence, our secured lending volumes,
which at June 2006 were down 19.3% on
2005, ﬁnished the year only 2.1% down 
at £338 million (2005: £345 million). 
See Fig 5.
Progress continues to be made in our
partnership with Alliance & Leicester,
under which we manage applications for
their secured personal loan product, with
the option for Welcome to underwrite
applications that do not meet Alliance &
Leicester’s own lending criteria. Sales so far
have been small as Alliance & Leicester
gains experience in marketing this product
and we reﬁne the sales fulﬁlment processes. 
A number of enhancements are planned
during 2007, to build on current
performance.
Although the division does not offer 
ﬁrst mortgage loan products, Welcome
Mortgages introduces existing customers
requiring such products to third party
lenders, on a commission basis. New
business placed by Welcome Mortgages 
in 2006 amounted to approximately 
£100 million.
Home collected credit
Our disengagement from uneconomic
sectors of this market continued during
2006 and total advances made to home
collected customers fell by 8.5% to £122
million (2005: £133 million). Revenue also
decreased by £12.1 million to £85.2 million
and the home collected loan loss charge
reduced by £7.2 million to £21.9 million. 
At 31 December 2006, home collected 
credit receivables amounted to £114 million
(2005: £123 million), representing 6%
(2005: 8%) of the division’s total
receivables. See Fig 6.
The division had 307,000 (2005: 308,000)
home collected credit customers at 
31 December 2006, which included around
15,000 customers transferred from The
Lewis Group, following the acquisition 
of certain debt portfolios in the year. The
average customer balance at 31 December
2006 was £466 (2005: £521). See Fig 7.
Unsecured personal loans
Many mainstream lenders have tightened
their underwriting criteria during the year as
they continued to experience deteriorating
credit quality. This led to a 9.1% reduction
for the unsecured personal lending market 
in the UK as a whole, as reported by the
Finance & Leasing Association (FLA).
Our extensive experience in the non-
standard ﬁnance sector, together with 
the beneﬁts now being realised from our
investment in our new customer selection
systems, have supported a signiﬁcant
increase in the number of customer
applications being received by the division
from its well established network of 
brokers and introducers. 
This, together with conﬁdence in our
bespoke credit scorecards, which have
remained unchanged throughout the 
year, have enabled the division to increase
substantially its unsecured loan volumes 
by 33.8% during the year to £357 million
(2005: £267 million). See Fig 3.
Hire purchase
Building on our extensive experience and
long-term commitment to the hire purchase
sector, volumes continued to grow strongly
throughout the year, increasing by 39.7% 
to £294 million (2005: £210 million). 
See Fig 4.
This is a strong performance in a UK
market which, according to FLA ﬁgures,
experienced an overall reduction of around
10% during 2006. It reﬂects the continuing
success of Welcome’s hire purchase ﬁeld
sales team, supported by our Hull CPU, in
developing a national distribution network
of external introducers for used car ﬁnance. 
Welcome Car Finance, our car retailer, 
had a successful year and remains the
division’s largest introducer of hire purchase
customers. Operating from 11 sites across
the UK, Welcome Car Finance increased its
sales of used cars by 24.7% during the year
to 8,993 (2005: 7,209). 
Secured loans
Second charge secured lending in the 
UK reached an all-time high during 2006,
rising at an annual rate of 16.9%, as
reported by the FLA. This increase reﬂects
many providers preferring to make secured
loans, after incurring higher bad debts from
unsecured lending.

ADVANCES (£m)  At present, we only lend to around
one in 10 people who apply for
direct repayment loans. We could
comfortably accept many more
within our existing risk proﬁles.
And we’ll do so – at a pace that
allows us to develop appropriate
products and stay as close to
individual customers as we do 
today. In our book, even double 
digit growth shouldn’t be rushed.

Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2006 Lending money responsibly is only
the start of our job. We also need 
to be good at collecting it back.
So we stay close to our customers.
That’s what our branch network 
is for – and excels at. If a customer
encounters repayment difficulties, 
we try to help them ﬁnd a solution
quickly.
Result: fewer defaults and bad debts.
And some very reassured customers.
Good risk management doesn’t
always mean saying ‘No’.

The Lewis Group had an exceptionally
successful year in 2006, increasing its 
proﬁt before tax by 76.8% to £4.9 million
(2005: £2.8 million). See Fig 8.
Lewis receivables, comprising purchased
debt portfolios, more than doubled during
the year to £91 million (2005: £44 million).
Debt purchases during 2006 totalled 
£69 million (2005: £32 million), making
The Lewis Group one of the top three
players in the UK purchased debt market.
Improved collections performance during
2006 resulted in a positive revaluation of 
£1.7 million in the division’s purchased 
debt portfolios at 31 December 2006. 
The level of commission based activity
during 2006 remained little changed from
the previous year, generating income of 
£6.6 million (2005: £6.4 million) – of 
which 80% related to third parties and 
the remainder to our own consumer credit
division.
The Lewis Group acquired an unsecured
debt portfolio of £52.2 million in July 2006,
from a third party credit provider, for a
consideration of £8.0 million. A portfolio 
of UK credit card debt receivables was 
also acquired in December 2006, under 
an agreement which provides the division 
with a ‘forward ﬂow’ of smaller tranches 
of debt during the next three years.
The group’s total debt portfolio investment 
under this agreement will be approximately 
£65 million.

Cattles Invoice Finance made pre-tax proﬁts
of £3.5 million in 2006, compared with
£4.7 million in 2005. As reported at the
half-year stage, one of the division’s 
six offices was adversely impacted by a
competitor seeking to gain market share 
at prices we considered to be uneconomic.
Each of the division’s other ﬁve offices
performed strongly during 2006, delivering
increased proﬁts over the previous year.

FUTURE
I am delighted with the group’s strong
performance in 2006, which has been
accomplished through the tremendous
efforts and total commitment of our
management and staff. I would very much
like to offer my personal thanks to all our
employees for their invaluable contribution
to the group’s continuing success. 
Demand for the group’s products remains
strong and the beneﬁts from our signiﬁcant
investment in Phoenix are now being
realised. Good growth in direct repayment
customer numbers was generated in 2006
and we continue to receive an increasing
number of customer loan applications from
our well established network of major 
credit brokers and introducers. 
The group has made a strong start to 2007.
The growth momentum of the second 
half of 2006 has continued in 2007, with
record new business volumes being achieved
in the ﬁrst two months of this year. Credit
quality, customers’ arrears and bad debts
remain stable.
I ﬁrmly believe that the group is well
positioned to take advantage of the
signiﬁcant growth opportunities available 
in the non-standard consumer ﬁnance
market. Together with my senior
management team, I look forward 
to another successful year in 2007.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
Project Phoenix was successfully
implemented on schedule in June 2006.
These major new information technology
and customer relationship management
systems support and signiﬁcantly enhance
Welcome’s direct repayment customer
selection and underwriting processes,
enabling us to match our customers’
evolving credit status and needs to 
our product range. 
Further IT developments in 2007 will 
enable introducers to link electronically 
into our systems, and to build closer and
more efficient relationships with the
division. This technology is already being
used by several larger brokers to refer
customers’ unsecured loan applications 
to Welcome and it will be extended to 
other introducers in 2007. 
FUNDING
Group net receivables increased during the
year by £432 million to £2.1 billion (2005:
£1.7 billion) and borrowings increased 
in the same period by £398 million to 
£1.8 billion (2005: £1.4 billion).
At 31 December 2006, the group had
available headroom of £336 million 
(2005: £274 million) within its existing
funding facilities, with an average maturity
of four and a half years. 
A fundraising of £500 million was launched
in the bank syndication market in May
2006. Interest proved to be extremely 
strong and the transaction was successfully
completed in July at £800 million. These
new funds replaced existing bank facilities
of £393 million at reduced pricing and
longer maturity and also provided the 
group with additional working capital.
We were delighted to receive increased
support from our existing lenders and also
pleased to welcome several new banks to
this syndicated loan. The group now enjoys
support from over 30 banking relationships.
We have maintained our long established
treasury strategy of limiting exposure to
interest rate volatility through appropriate
ﬁnancial hedging instruments. At the year
end, around 80% of the group’s total
borrowings of £1.8 billion were protected
against future interest rate volatility, for 
an average period of around four and 
a half years.
OPERATING AND 
FINANCIAL REVIEW
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW 
CONTINUED
Phoenix, our new IT and customer
relationship management systems were
successfully implemented in June 2006.
The beneﬁts of this investment are 
already being realised.
Interest in a £500 million
fundraising in May 2006
proved so strong it completed
at £800 million This is not a business for the
uncommitted. A lot of players 
come into the market when times 
are good. But when conditions
tighten, they tend to pull back.
Because we’ve always stayed, we’ve
built an unrivalled store of customer
performance data. We’ve learned 
to adapt ﬂexibly to the changing
economic climate. Our people are
experienced and well trained. We’ve
honed our credit scoring methods
and customer selection processes.
And we’ve invested signiﬁcantly 
in IT that enables us to make 
sound, risk-managed decisions
without hesitation.
Because our people really know 
what they’re doing, every one can be
a risk manager. Which gives us more
conﬁdence, whatever the conditions.

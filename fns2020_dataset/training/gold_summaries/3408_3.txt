Notes:
1.  Like for Like comparisons are calculated by taking current year actual 
results (which include acquisitions from the relevant date of completion) 
compared with prior year actual results, adjusted to include the results of 
acquisitions for the commensurate period in the prior year.
2.  Before taking account of amortisation of acquired intangible assets and 
impairment of goodwill (£3.3 million, 2010: £3.0 million) and costs relating 
to acquisitions and restructuring (£3.0 million, 2010: £2.2 million). In the 
Income Statement this is referred to as Headline Operating Profit.
In 2011 Chime has had its seventh successive year 
of growth in operating income, operating profit and 
margin. We think this is an impressive achievement 
given the difficult economic conditions in 2011. The 
Group is well positioned for the future with a very 
positive year ahead for Sports Marketing in particular. 
We are making four earnings enhancing acquisitions 
which will continue to strengthen our offering in 
growth markets.
Review	of	Operations
2011 was a year in which the company continued to 
grow and improve its operating profit and margin.
The major highlight was the continued development 
of the Sports Marketing Division which through a 
combination of acquisitions and organic growth has 
evolved into a world class leading sports marketing 
agency. The sector is projected to grow 5% per year. 
We now have Sports Marketing offices in 11 countries 
and are ideally positioned to benefit from this growth. 
We have major contracts for the 2012 Olympics, 
including: 
• Organising the in-stadia activities for 18 Olympic 
sports and 8 Paralympic sports
• Activating Olympic sponsorship programmes for 
BT, GSK, G4S and the National Lottery 
• Handling on behalf of LOCOG all event look, 
branding and wayfinding across all Olympic venues. 
Also appointed to do the same for the GLA across 
London and all other UK cities involved in Olympic 
branding programmes
• Securing commercial partnerships with corporate 
sponsors for five Olympic sports: athletics, 
basketball, triathlon, gymnastics and paralympic 
sport
• Ambassador programmes for Oscar Pistorius, 
Roger Black, Sharron Davies and Mark Foster
• Providing strategic guidance on the Olympic 
Opportunity and hands on activation around guest 
engagement programmes for 12 Olympic clients 
including BP, Coca Cola, Samsung, NBC and the 
International Olympic Committee (iLUKA)
                             4 / 109  
• Undertaking detailed legacy studies around the 
Olympic Stadium and other venues for the Olympic 
Delivery Authority
As announced at the time of the interim results, our 
main contract with the American Government ended 
which resulted in some restructuring costs being 
incurred in 2011. The loss of profit from the client was 
largely compensated for by a major uplift in the Sports 
Marketing Division profits through the acquisition of 
Icon and a very good performance by the Advertising 
and Marketing Services Division. 
The Group acted for 1,815 clients in 2011 compared 
to 1,494 in 2010. 325 of these clients used more 
than one of our businesses (277 in 2010) which 
represented 68% of total operating income (2010: 66%).
242 clients paid us over £100,000 in 2011, compared 
to 205 in 2010. Our top 30 clients represented 45% of 
total operating income (2010: 49%). 
Our two largest clients represented 19% of operating 
income (2010: 21%). 
Average fee income per client in 2011 was £90,000 
compared to £100,000 in 2010. This reduction was 
caused by some of our acquisitions having a large 
number of small clients. The average fee income of 
our existing businesses remained at about £100,000. 
Average income per employee was £112,000 in 2011 
compared to £120,000 in 2010. Again this reduction 
was caused by acquisitions. In 2011, 47% of our 
income came from overseas work compared to  
51% in 2010. 
Divisional	Per for mance
In 2011, three of our four divisions showed growth 
in operating income and operating profit both like for 
like and in total. Excluding the American Government 
contract, the rest of the Public Relations Division 
showed growth. 
Public Relations represented 42% of operating income 
(2010: 49%), Advertising and Marketing Services was 
28% (2010: 26%), Sports Marketing was 25% (2010: 
20%) and Insight and Engagement 5% (2010: 5%).

Three earnings enhancing acquisitions were 
completed in 2011. Since its acquisition there has 
been strong growth in Icon. Fast Track Hong Kong 
and pmplegacy (event bidding consultancy) also grew 
strongly, the remainder of the business was flat in 
2011 but is well positioned for growth in 2012. 2012 
has started well, good organic growth is expected 
and many opportunities are already being identified, 
particularly in Brazil for 2013 and beyond. 
Major client wins included Renewal of UEFA 
Champions League three year contract for Icon, 
Baku (Azerbaijan) tender for the 2020 Olympic

Corporate Activity
Our strategy remains to expand the range of services 
and geographical reach of the services we can offer  
to clients. 
We completed six acquisitions in 2011: 
Sports
• Icon – experiential marketing
• Essentially France
• Golden Goal – Brazil
Healthcare (part of Public Relations)
• Reynolds Mackenzie – public relations
• LEC – advertising
Marketing Services
• Gulliford Consulting – marketing consultancy
We have also announced the acquisitions of  
McKenzie Clark, a 60% interest in Rough Hill Limited 
and a 40% interest in StratAgile Limited. We have  
also entered into a conditional agreement to acquire 
iLUKA Limited (‘iLUKA’).
McKenzie Clark
Chime has acquired 100% of McKenzie Clark, a 
leading UK graphics and branding specialist, from 
Graham Clark and four minority shareholders for initial 
consideration of £600,000 in cash. Further tranches  
of deferred consideration totalling a maximum of  
£3.4 million may be payable depending upon the 
future trading performance of McKenzie Clark. 
At Chime’s option up to 50% of the deferred 
consideration may be satisfied through the issue  
of new Chime ordinary shares.
Rough Hill
Chime has acquired 60% of the share capital of 
Rough Hill Limited and certain other assets (together, 
‘Rough Hill’) from its three owners Jeremy Simmonds, 
Matthew Smith and Richard Moore (the ‘Rough Hill 
vendors’) for initial consideration of £480,000 in 
cash and the issue of 83,618 new ordinary shares in 
Chime and £180,000 in cash representing working 
capital of Rough Hill at acquisition that is surplus to 
requirements after Rough Hill joins the group. Rough 
Hill is a specialist agency focusing on youth marketing. 
Following acquisition one of Rough Hill’s businesses 
will be injected into a new company within VCCP – 
VCCP Live which will be 40% owned by Rough  
Hill’s vendors.
Following the 2012 results, deferred consideration 
may become payable in relation to the acquisition of 
the 60% stake which is capped at £46,000 and will 
be settled 70% in cash and 30% through the issue of 
new ordinary shares in Chime (although at Chime’s 
option the whole payment may be in cash).
In addition, the Rough Hill vendors have a put option 
exercisable between March 2016 and March 2020 
whereby they can require Chime to purchase some 
or all of their remaining 40% interest in Rough Hill 
at a price calculated in relation to the performance 
of the Rough Hill businesses but where the total 
consideration paid by Chime (including the initial and 
deferred consideration) cannot exceed £5 million. At 
Chime’s option 50% of any additional consideration 
may be satisfied through the issue of new ordinary 
shares in Chime.

iLUKA
Chime has entered into a conditional agreement to 
acquire 100% of the share capital of iLUKA. iLUKA 
is a sports marketing agency that manages and 
activates major events on behalf of clients.
Chime is acquiring the business from its founders, Jon 
Hillman and Richard Giltinan and Managing Director, 
Felicity Shankar. Chime expects to complete the 
acquisition in March or April 2012.
For the year to 30 June 2011, iLUKA reported revenue 
of £5.8 million, gross profit of £3.7 million and a loss 
after taxation of £0.3 million. Gross assets at 30 June 
2011 were £0.25 million. 
The nature of iLUKA’s business is that it generally has 
positive cash flow and cash at completion is expected 
to exceed £6 million, reflecting cash paid in advance 
by clients.
On completion, Chime will pay an initial consideration 
of £4.0 million in cash and issue 555,361 new Chime 
ordinary shares. On completion, Chime expects its 
own net cash position to benefit by around £1 million.
Further tranches of deferred contingent consideration 
may become payable depending on the future trading 
performance of iLUKA in March 2013, March 2015 
and March 2018. Such deferred payments will not 
exceed £19.7 million and at Chime’s option 50% of 
each payment may be satisfied through the issue of 
new Chime ordinary shares.
StratAgile
Chime has acquired 40% of the share capital of 
StratAgile from its co-founder Thomas Suman Ann for 
an initial consideration of £190,000 in cash. StratAgile 
is a data analytics business based in Singapore.
Further tranches of deferred consideration totalling  
a maximum of £210,000 may be payable depending 
upon the future trading performance of StratAgile. 
30% of the deferred consideration may, at Chime’s 
option, be satisfied through the issue of new Chime 
ordinary shares.
Application will be made for the 83,618 new ordinary 
shares of 25 pence each in the capital of Chime  
(the ‘new ordinary shares’) being issued as part of  
the initial consideration for Rough Hill to be listed on 
the Official List of the Financial Services Authority 
and to be admitted to trading by the London Stock 
Exchange on its main market for listed securities.  
It is expected that dealings in the new ordinary shares 
will commence on 12 March 2012. The new ordinary 
shares will rank pari passu with Chime’s existing 
issued shares. Application will be made in due course 
for the issue of the 555,361 new Chime ordinary 
shares to be issued on completion of the iLUKA 
acquisition.
The issued share capital of the Company is currently 
81,212,838 ordinary 25p shares each with voting 
rights. Therefore, following admission of the new 
Chime ordinary shares issued in connection with 
the Rough Hill acquisition the issued share capital of 
the Company on 12 March 2012 will be 81,296,456 
ordinary shares each with voting rights.
Chime expects all these transactions to be 
immediately earnings enhancing.

Possible Sale of part of the Public Relations 
Division
Discussions continue on the potential buyout of part 
of the Public Relations Division which represents less 
than 10% of Group profit. A further announcement will 
be made in due course.
Corporate and Social Responsibility
We have again made further progress with our 
corporate responsibility programme this year. We 
continue to work hard on the reduction of our carbon 
emissions, reducing our carbon footprint per full 
time employee in 2010 by 6.6%. We are currently 
calculating our footprint for 2011 and will publish the 
results in our CSR Report later in the year. We are 
expecting a further 5% reduction. Our processes 
are embedded within the business both in our office 
operations and in our external relationships with 
clients, suppliers and partners.
We have also expanded our training programme 
to deliver improved personal development for our 
staff at all levels. We continue to run our graduate 
scheme and have also twinned with a number of 
organisations to bring a community element to our 
staff volunteering. Great Ormond Street Hospital,  
The Passage, Childline, Scope, Shelterbox and 
Chernobyl Trust are amongst the selected partners  
of our trading divisions.
We continue to be listed on FTSE4Good Index and 
are proud to be a Carbon Trust Standard Bearer.
Outlook	
Chime Group’s strategy is designed to take 
advantage of the realignment that is occurring within 
the communications marketplace. We believe that 
a significant opportunity exists from exploiting the 
growing business opportunities in sport over the 
next ten years. As such, we anticipate a greater 
contribution from the sports marketing businesses in 
2012 and beyond. Chime’s Sports Marketing Division 
is one of the top five sports businesses in the world 
and it is well placed to benefit from the trends we  
are seeing.
Chime will remain a broadly based marketing 
communications group and in addition to the 
opportunities in Sport, will continue to focus on Public 
Relations (within which Healthcare is also expected 
to perform strongly and is another important driver 
for growth) but should also register good growth 
in Advertising and Marketing Services. This will 
be complemented by the recovery of Insight and 
Engagement which is expected to continue. 
We will make further earnings enhancing acquisitions 
and initiate start-ups which expand the range of 
services and geographies that we can offer to clients.
We will continue to prioritise both strong cost control 
and the retention of a high margin. We will also 
continue to manage the finances prudently.

“ The Board is recommending 
a final dividend of 13.4 pence 
per share.”
A Year of Strategic Delivery
Genus had a strong year in 2015, as 
we delivered on our innovation-led 
strategy and increasingly focused on 
the larger scale commercial producers 
of pork, beef and milk, who are most 
able to benefit from our genetic 
improvement. We achieved particularly 
strong profit growth, driven by an 
excellent year for Genus PIC in the 
Americas. Genus ABS grew sales 
worldwide but higher product costs 
meant its profits were flat in constant 
currency. Difficult conditions in China 
and Russia held back Genus Asia 
but both markets now appear to be 
exhibiting early signs of improvement.
Our genetic lead in our porcine and 
bovine products is underpinned by our 
R&D programmes and we continued 
to strengthen our pipeline. During the 
year, we continued to increase the 
rate of porcine genetic improvement, 
accelerated the production of high-
quality dairy genetics through 
our elite herds and conducted 
successful trials of our Genus Sexed 
Semen (‘GSS’) technology. 
We also added to our capabilities 
in dairy and beef, through the 
purchase of a majority stake in IVB. 
IVB will enhance our model in ABS, 
allowing us to offer superior male and 
female genetics through embryos 
to our beef and dairy customers. In 
addition, we successfully completed 
the integration of Génétiporc, which 
we acquired in the previous year, 
and acquired Birchwood Genetics.
High-Calibre Leadership
The Genus Executive Leadership 
Team (‘GELT’) is now well established 
and we are seeing the team’s impact 
across the business. GELT is made 
up of highly qualified leaders, who 
are working together to deliver our 
strategy and tackle the issues we 
face, through collaboration and by 
constructively challenging each other. 
GELT’s members bring deep sectoral 
or functional expertise to the business, 
coupled with the strength of intellect 
we need to drive the business forward.
The latest evaluation of the Board’s 
performance confirmed that it 
continues to perform well and provides 
the right oversight and guidance to the 
Group. Following the appointments of 
Professor Duncan Maskell and Lykele 
van der Broek as Non-Executive 
Directors, which we reported on last 
year, there were no further additions 
to the Board in 2015. During the year 
both new Board members completed 
their induction and are already making 
a significant contribution. The principal 
change from the evaluation has been 
that the Board has increased time 
devoted to developing our strategy.
Professor Barry Furr retired as 
a Non-Executive Director at the 
Annual General Meeting (‘AGM’) in 
November 2014. We were greatly 
saddened by his death in early 2015 
and want to record our thanks for 
his immense contribution to the 
Company during the eight years 
that Barry served on the Board.
More information about our corporate 
governance arrangements, including 
details of the Board evaluation and 
our induction programme, can 
be found on pages 54 to 83.
A Responsible Business
CSR is fundamental to our business 
and integral to every part of our 
strategy. Its importance is reflected 
in our vision – pioneering animal 
genetic improvement to help 
nourish the world – which captures 
our contribution to society. Our 
CSR Committee helps lead these 
efforts, defines our CSR strategy 
and oversees the execution of this 
strategy. Its members include our in-
house experts on animal welfare, the 
environment, safety and employees.
Genus employs over 2,600 people 
worldwide and I want to thank every 
one for their dedication and hard work 
throughout the year. We continue to 
invest in developing their skills and 
unleashing their talent, recognising 
that this underpins our service delivery 
for customers and our ability to 
innovate. We recognise exceptional 
new thinking through our coveted 
Chairman’s Award. This year, the award 
went to a team from ABS in North 
America, who devised “Net Profit 
Genetics”, a programme challenging 
dairy customers to think differently 
about selecting sires for their 
herds. The programme exemplifies 
the spirit that runs through the 
Chairman’s Award and I congratulate 
the team for its achievement.
Providing Returns to Shareholders
The Board directs the Company 
on shareholders’ behalf. Providing 
attractive returns on capital 
and dividends to shareholders 
are therefore an important part 
of our corporate goals.
We are recommending a final dividend 
of 13.4 pence per share. Combined 
with the interim dividend of 6.1 pence 
per share, this gives a total dividend 
for the year of 19.5 pence per share. 
This is an increase of 10% over last 
year. The final dividend will be paid 
on 4 December 2015 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of 
business on 20 November 2015.
Summary
Genus performed strongly 
during the year and continued to 
successfully deliver on its strategy. 
The Board remains focused on the 
Group’s leadership and talent, its 
R&D capabilities, the execution 
of its strategy, and overseeing 
the Company’s performance. 
The long-term drivers of our 
markets remain attractive and we 
continue to position the business 
to benefit from this opportunity.

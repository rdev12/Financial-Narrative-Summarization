INTRODUCTION
I am pleased to report a strong set of
financial results and that the Group 
has made further excellent progress 
in line with its strategic objectives. 
In Specialist Engineering we have
continued to grow revenue, further
enhanced by the acquisition of Seymour,
and have maintained our strong margins.
In Specialist Building we have seen
excellent growth in operating margins 
at steady levels of revenue.
We are experiencing buoyant demand for
the Group’s specialist services in our
chosen market sectors, with the Group
order book up 21% in the period. The
order book also reflects a higher quality
of work founded on strong levels of
repeat business from key clients and a
further increase in the proportion of work
won within our specialist market sectors,
which remain robust.
We continue to be recognised for the 
high quality and standard of work we 
are consistently delivering to our
customers and have received awards 
and commendations for a number of our
businesses, specifically in the areas of
environmental, design and innovation.
Particularly pleasing is the excellent
progress we are making in Health &
Safety, which continues to be a key area
of focus across the Group, reflected by a
significant reduction in our Accident
Incidence Rate and recognised by a
number of RoSPA awards.
RESULTS AND DIVIDEND
Group turnover from ongoing operations
for the year ended 30 September 2007
was £347.8m (2006: £341.7m) and profit
before tax was £7.2m (2006: £4.6m).
Earnings per share were 11.85p 
(2006: 10.00p). The Group’s net cash
balance at 30 September was £24.4m
(2006: £19.4m) after paying for the 
£5.9m acquisition of Seymour outlined
below. Net assets have increased to
£10.1m from £5.3m.
The Board is proposing a final dividend 
of 1.2p per share, which will be paid 
on 25 February 2008 to shareholders on
the register as at 18 January 2008. 
This will result in a dividend of 1.8p per
share for the full year (2006: 1.2p), a 
50% increase, reflecting the Group’s
progressive dividend policy and the
Board’s confidence in the Group’s 
future prospects.
GROWTH STRATEGY
On 26 July 2007, the Group announced
another acquisition in the form of
Seymour (Civil Engineering Contractors)
Limited (“Seymour”), the water
engineering services provider, for a net
cash consideration of £5.9m, expanding
the Group’s Specialist Engineering
activities into the water sector. The
integration of Seymour is progressing 
well and the business is trading in line
with our expectations. 
As Brian May outlines in more detail in 
his Chief Executive’s review, we continue
to seek organic growth in our current
specialist areas of activity, whilst 
pursuing further strategic acquisitions in
Specialist Engineering.
MANAGEMENT AND HEAD OFFICE 
On 1 October 2006, John Bishop FCA
joined the Board as non-executive
Director, and on 31 October 2006,
Arnold Wagner OBE stepped down from
the Board as a non-executive Director.
During the year the Group relocated its
head office to Aberford, near Leeds, and
streamlined its head office function.
Certain key appointments were also
made, including that of our Group Lawyer
and Company Secretary, Ben Feather,
who joined Renew from HBOS after
spending several years with Addleshaw
Goddard in Leeds.
AUDITORS
We have been reviewing our
engagements with a number of the
professional advisors to the Group and,
following a competitive tender process, 
in July 2007 the Board appointed KPMG
Audit Plc as auditors in succession to
RSM Robson Rhodes LLP .
OUTLOOK
The Group is now in a position of
strength. All of the performance targets
set at the beginning of the year have
been exceeded. We continue to grow
cash backed profits in key areas of the
market where we see further opportunities
for organic growth and there is substantial
work being done in pursuing further
strategic acquisitions. The Board is
confident that the excellent progress
made during the year will continue.

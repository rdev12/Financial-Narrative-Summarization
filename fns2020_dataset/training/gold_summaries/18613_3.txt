Grainger Trust plc 
Chairman’s statement
Profit before tax and exceptional items has increased by 8% to
£48.5m (2002: pre exceptional item £44.9m). Grainger’s own 
profit before tax and exceptional items rose 20% to £37.7m from
£31.4m, driven by a rise in profits from trading sales in our Tenanted
Residential Division. We did not acquire the outstanding interest in
Bromley until our year end and so have only included a 50% share
of its results. As expected Bromley’s pre tax profits were lower at
£10.8m from £13.5m last year because of the very significant
£330m asset disposal programme in 2002. The post tax
contribution has, however, remained relatively constant because 
the disposal programme produced a disproportionately high tax
charge. The increase in group post tax profitability has produced 
a rise of 24% in earnings per share before exceptional items to
118.5p from 95.3p. Statutory earnings per share increased by 
40% to 118.5p from 84.6p. 
Net asset value per share (‘NAV’) after adjusting for the market 
value of our trading properties and investments has risen by 27% 
to £21.94 from £17.24. NNNAV , which takes account of all deferred
tax liabilities and adjustments for the market value of our long-term
debt and financial instruments, has advanced by 16% to £13.91
from £12.03. Net asset value on a statutory balance sheet basis is
£6.01 (2002: £4.89).
For the first time we are disclosing an alternative measure of NNNAV
to take into account the potential value of the reversionary surplus in
our regulated and life tenancy portfolios. This is the difference
between the vacant possession value of our properties and the
investment or market value, and currently stands at £455m. We
have calculated the anticipated timing of the realisation of that
surplus, discounted it back to present value and then deducted 
tax. This produces a discounted post tax reversionary surplus
amounting to £111.2m or £4.49 per share. When added to NNNAV
we obtain a ‘Grainger NAV’ of £18.40 per share. Full details of the
calculation are given in the operating and financial review. 
Your directors are recommending a final dividend of 12.80p per
share (2002: 11.13p), payable on 5 March 2004 to shareholders on
the register at close of business on 13 February 2004. This together
with the interim dividend of 3.51p per share (2002: 3.05p) amounts
to a total of 16.31p per share (2002: 14.18p), an increase of 15%
for the fifth consecutive year.
During the year we successfully refinanced our Bromley Joint
Venture, comprising the BPT portfolio, lowering borrowing costs 
and enabling a dividend of £52.0m to be paid to each of the Joint
Venture partners. BPT was further rationalised during the year and
now comprises a portfolio principally of core regulated assets.
Towards the year end we acquired Deutsche Bank’s interest, to take
full control of the business. This is the major factor in the doubling 
of the group’s asset base (market value at 30 September 2003
£1,388m, 2002: £691m) and has been achieved without recourse
to shareholder funding.
Our tenanted residential business has prospered during the year
and we continued to buy additional stock. In the year Grainger
purchased a total of 1,736 units for £112.2m, and at the year end
our portfolio, including the BPT assets, stood at 12,030 units with a
market value of £1,164m and vacant possession value of £1,648m.
These acquisitions included 918 life tenancy units bought from NPI
for £40.5m, taking our total life tenancy portfolio to 2,291 units with
a market value of £134.3m.

We will continue to develop our key themes;
focusing on tenanted residential activities,
particularly the regulated sector but with the
new challenge of developing the life tenancy
business, applying our property and asset
management skills to produce additional
returns for the group and maintaining the
momentum in our Development and 
Trading Division.

Grainger Trust plc 
Chairman’s statement
Our development and trading business has generated operating
contributions of £13.6m and we have several exciting opportunities
in the pipeline. In particular, we announced in June 2003 that we
had been selected by Islington Council to develop two key mixed-
use sites in the Borough. 
The acquisition of Bromley not only brings us complete ownership
of a high quality portfolio of residential assets but also provides us
with a core of experienced and efficient staff. This, combined with
our longstanding network of external managing agents, enables us
to achieve high quality national coverage, able to supply both asset
and property management services. 
John Ward will be leaving the board at the annual general meeting.
John was appointed as a non-executive director on 24 February
1994 and has been chairman of the audit committee since 18 June
2002. He brought a high level of general commercial and detailed
banking knowledge to the group. We thank him for his very
significant contribution.
We are pleased with the progress made on the business’s
objectives in the year. In particular, the acquisition of Bromley
provides us with both the asset base and core of skilled, experienced
staff that enables us to deliver effective residential asset and
property management services on a national basis, not only for 
our own activities, but also to third parties. 
We will continue to develop our key themes; focusing on tenanted
residential activities, particularly the regulated sector but with the
new challenge of developing the life tenancy business, applying 
our property and asset management skills to produce additional
returns for the group and maintaining the momentum in our
Development and Trading Division.
The future looks both exciting and rewarding.

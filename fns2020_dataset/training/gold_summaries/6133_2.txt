The Group at a glance
“A key element of Focus Business Solutions’ success to date has been its
ability to win business through its domain expertise enabling us to build a
stronger customer base within the retail financial services marketplace.”
Mark Thelwell, Chief Operating Officer, Focus Solutions Group plc
Established in 1995 and originating from a consultancy providing
insurance industry expertise to AT&T’s value added services division,
Focus Solutions Group is one of the fastest growing software
organisations in the UK and a leading provider of business process
solutions to the retail financial services market.
Having become a leader in delivering business process solutions to
support and enhance the sales and marketing process of financial
products, the Group recognised the potential for goal:technology,
its innovative XML development tool, in wider markets and
geographies. A partnership team was established to leverage
business through building strategic partnerships. To focus on 
the two strategies, in April 2005, the Group created two distinct
business units; Focus Business Solutions and Focus Software, each
with dedicated management teams, supported by a central
services business unit.
● Focus Business Solutions Ltd
providing software solutions based on goal:technology to
support the sale of pensions, mortgages and insurance
products
● Focus Software Ltd
exploiting the value of goal:technology through partnerships
and distributors
Focus Business Solutions Ltd
Since its conception in 1995 Focus Business Solutions (FBS) has
played a pivotal role in promoting the take-up of e-commerce 
within the UK retail financial services market and it was one of 
the co-founders of the life & pensions industry electronic trading
data standards.
Having operated in the financial services market for over 10 years,
FBS has built up an unparalleled knowledge of the industry,
products, regulation and distribution, enabling the organisation 
to work with all sectors of the community and become the leading
e-commerce expert in the market.
Using goal:technology, FBS created a unique approach to
developing business process solutions to support the customer
management process, called MCA (Multi Channel Advice). MCA is
FBS’ core proposition, a single solution that is scaleable, reusable
and can be deployed across multiple channels – ideal for the
complex distribution structure of the retail financial services market.
Taking its expertise gained in the UK life and pensions market, 
FBS entered the mortgage market in 2004 and in little over a year
has built a strong customer base. This is a newly heavily regulated
market with similar business and distribution issues to FBS’ core
domain. FBS is now working to build its business in the general
insurance market space as this also becomes increasingly regulated.
FBS has established a blue chip
customer base within the
financial services market and has 
received various industry
accolades including winning 
the Financial Sector Technology
Award for ‘Best use of IT in
Insurance’ in both 2003 and 
2004 for solutions built for 
Norwich Union and Zurich
respectively.

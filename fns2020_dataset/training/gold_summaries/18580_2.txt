 What We Do
Genus applies biotechnology to 
accelerate genetic improvement and 
deliver it to our customers, quickly and 
efficiently. We breed and distribute 
the genes of the world’s best pigs and 
bulls, scientifically selecting livestock 
whose offspring is designed to increase 
the profitability of our customers, 
who are some of the world’s biggest 
farmers and food producers.
In the porcine market, we sell 
genetically superior boars and 
sows that produce offspring with 
desirable characteristics, such as 
feed-efficient growth or leaner meat.
In the dairy and beef markets, our 
primary product is bull semen, 
which is delivered through artificial 
insemination to improve our 
customers’ herds and their efficiency. 
We also offer genetically superior 
embryos through our subsidiary IVB.

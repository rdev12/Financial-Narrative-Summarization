 TOPPS TILES PLC 
Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 07
This year, in a turbulent UK trading environment, we have again
demonstrated the fundamental strength of our business through the
continued delivery of improved profits.
Store Development and Expansion                                                                     
Our national store opening programme continues apace with a net 24
new stores (20 Topps and 4 Tile Clearing House) opened in this 
financial year. We now have a total of 244 trading stores (207 Topps
and 37 Tile Clearing House) and are firmly on our way to achieving our
stated target of a minimum of 350 UK outlets. We continue to enjoy a
good pipeline of suitable sites for occupation or development.
In line with our policy of continued store development and 
refurbishment, 3 stores were closed or relocated, 15 re-fitted and a net
24 new stores opened in the period. We have a total of 64 stores 
offering our tile studio concept of extra choice of up-market tiles, 
available on a special order basis and 17 floorstores with an enhanced
stock range of laminate and real wood flooring. The average square
footage of our stores has increased gradually and is now  over 6,300
square feet.
Our Stoneworks concept has continued to be popular, as consumers’
appetite for natural product grows. We now have 19 stores open with
a full Stoneworks offering and we also offer a selected range of these
products in all our other stores.
Holland
We now have a total of 13 stores trading in Holland under our 50/50
joint venture including two new stores opened in the period. It is our
intention to open a minimum two stores in the next financial period.    
Marketing, advertising and sponsorship
As part of our strategy to be “the brand” of choice in the UK we 
have again continued our nationwide marketing and advertising 
programme. Our approach is two fold: using national television 
advertising both digital and terrestrial coupled with print and radio
advertising on a regional basis. This is not only an effective strategy in
respect of maximising our reach UK wide but is also a cost effective
approach, spreading costs across each store in concentrated areas such
as central London, for example, the Carlton Weather sponsorship.

Annual Report and Financial Statements 2005 09
More specifically, in 2004 the UK ceramic tile market grew 12% to 77.2
million square metres, an increase of 49% compared with 2000. At
manufacturers selling prices the market was worth close to £400 
million in 2004 (source MBD).  
The UK still has a very low consumption rate compared to its European
counterparts with only 1.1% of world consumption in 2004 compared
with, for example Spain at 5.9% (Source: Ceramic World Review).
Consumption continues to increase driven by issues such as health
and hygiene, an increase in second bathrooms, shower rooms, 
conservatories and utility rooms and an increase in the use of 
underfloor heating systems.  
UK Retail sales of ceramic tiles are expected to increase by 26% by
2010 (source: MBD) and we are confident therefore of the continued
growth in the ceramic tile market.
Current trading
In the first seven weeks of the new financial period we have recorded a
like-for-like sales decrease of 4.7%, however, the two year like-for-like
sales shows an increase of 14.1%. Overall sales have increased by 1.2%
over last year and 24.8% over two years. 
We have opened stores in Hayes, Lewes and Pentonville Road already
this new financial year with our target roll-out of 24 new stores for
2005/06.
There is no doubt that we, along with the rest of the UK retail sector,
are experiencing a very tough trading environment. However, given the
strength of these results we believe we have the right business model
and the best people to continue to gain market share and we are well
placed to maintain our goal of providing sustainable returns for 
shareholders.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S STATEMENT continued
Topps Tiles is one of Britain's biggest supporters of youth 
football. Topps stores currently sponsor 225 teams nationwide and our
yellow kit is arguably the most famous in the beautiful game.
Staff Development and Customer Service
Our vision is of high-performing, motivated and well-trained people
who can make a difference to our customers, shareholders, the 
business and themselves. We live by our values of friendly, helpful and
expert advice.  
The quality of leadership in the company is key to the successful 
delivery of our strategy for growth and our commitment to training,
development and career progression is demonstrated through our 
in-house training school, incentive schemes, bonus system, share save
schemes and other incentives including the ‘Home Computing
Initiative’ and the ‘Cycle to Work’ schemes. We have recently introduced
a comprehensive employee benefits scheme which includes a whole
range of internal and external company benefits from discounts on
holidays to an employee helpline service.
We understand the true value of all our employees and actively
encourage the recruitment of staff from all age groups. We have a 
policy of internal promotion, encouraging employees to advance their
careers both in the stores and the Head Office functions.
The market
Despite a widely reported slow down in spending, we believe that in
the mid-longer term DIY retail remains a relatively stable sector. There
are a number of factors underpinning the future of the retail DIY 
market. The UK population is growing steadily, particularly in the 35-
64 key age band for DIY; and household numbers are growing faster
than the population up from 22.4 million in 1991 to 24.5 million in
2003; and owner occupancy is also on the rise and with an ageing UK
housing stock that requires constant repair and maintenance. TOPPS TILES PLC

 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 4
For the year ended 31 October 2010
Chief Executive’s Report
When CAPS Solutions was acquired in 2007, 
the Group inherited a large embryonic contract 
to provide a planning system for Northern 
Ireland. This year not only saw the successful 
completion and roll out of this system across 
Northern Ireland but also the completion of the 
Scottish government contracts with a faultless 
post completion audit.   
Project sales within the Solutions segment were 
affected by Government cutbacks.  However, 
Idox enters 2011 with a strong pipeline. The 
Solutions segment gained critical mass through 
the acquisition of GRANTfinder, which has 
enabled it to deliver improved grants information 
and policy web solutions to the UK and now 
Europe utilising a common infrastructure. The 
same model is now being extended in both 
Holland and Spain, building on the division’s EU 
grants information coverage. 
The Recruitment segment had its most difficult 
year yet with public sector contractor revenues 
falling materially in the middle of the year and 
permanent recruitment revenues growing only 
slowly as it tracked the hesitant private sector 
recovery. Despite this, the business managed to 
deliver a positive contribution in the year. The last 
quarter saw a marked improvement in sentiment 
in both contract and permanent activity, giving 
the Board confidence for the current trading 
year.
In 2010, Idox continued to invest in software 
application development and has coordinated 
a number of initiatives internally to provide 
better solutions for customers. The Group has 
continued to manage its cost base meticulously 
and integrated three acquisitions without 
2010 was a challenging year which Idox 
successfully navigated. The customer base 
started the year already well advanced in their 
thinking on the need to cut costs, but uncertain 
as to the level of savings they would be required 
to achieve. Despite the uncertainty around 
the election in May, which distorted first half 
trading and delivery schedules, as well as the 
mini budget in July and the CSR in October, the 
outturn was broadly in line with most authorities’ 
expectations.
Going forward into 2011, Idox’s market is 
already well advanced in its execution and 
is now making final adjustments. Therefore 
the Group expects the market for application 
solutions that deliver a tangible return on 
investment will grow now from a flat base in 
2009/10.
The Software segment managed this change in 
the market well, ending the year with a strong 
sales performance. The year closed with a 
different mix from originally forecast as some 
major projects were stopped and investment 
in dashboard productivity solutions was 
surprisingly weak, but this was offset by strong 
performance in public access web solutions. 
The Software segment had some notable 
successes in partnering with authorities to build 
shared service solutions. This approach, plus 
a more comprehensive offering in managed 
technical services and outsourcing, delivered 
tangible improvements in services, cost 
efficiencies and speed of implementation.  
Internally Idox continued to place a strong 
emphasis on quality and customer care with 
further improvements in product performance, 
delivery and data migration. In 2011, the Group 
will further improve customer support and 
enhance client customer communication and 
strategic partnering.
The acquisition of the LAMP managed services 
contracts and Strand Electoral Management 
Services added to the Group’s market 
penetration, provided further synergies and 
expanded and improved the premium managed 
services offering.

increasing overheads.  As part of the integration 
process, the Group has also revised its 
corporate branding. 
Outlook
The Group has started the current financial year 
in a strong position, with greater predictability 
than has been the case for the past two years 
and a strong pipeline in all its businesses.  
Although total public sector spending is under 
intense pressure, Idox products and services 
enhance local government efficiencies and the 
Group expects the market for solutions that 
deliver a tangible return on investment to grow.  
The Group also has a wider range of capabilities, 
larger market share and broader reach in its 
markets.  There are encouraging signs of 
increased activity in a number of areas and 
Idox is well positioned to take advantage of 
new opportunities emerging in both 2011 and 
beyond.

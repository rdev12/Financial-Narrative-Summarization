 As Chairman of Premier 
Research Group plc I have 
great pleasure in presenting
this year’s results. It has been 
a period of significant progress 
for the Group and we have
achieved excellent results whilst
continuing to build the foundations
for future growth.
02 Premier Research Annual Report and Accounts 2006 It is with pleasure that I present my
report for Premier Research Group’s
first full year of trading since it was
admitted to AIM in December 2004.
I can report that it has been a year of
excellent growth both organically
and by way of acquisition with
turnover up by 77% to £16.5m and
operating profit rising by 143% to
£3.7m. Our declared intent when
going to AIM was to grow the Group
on a buy-and-build strategy which
has been achieved with three
acquisitions in the past twelve
months, all with the common thread
of remaining within our core areas of
competence providing balanced
growth between Europe and the USA
and giving us the ability to quote for
and handle larger contracts. In
addition, we now have a
geographical footprint across Eastern
Europe enabling a wider spread for
our clinical trials.
The key to any acquisition strategy is
the ability to integrate fully those
companies being acquired with a
minimum of disruption and as
speedily as possible. I am delighted
to report that this has been achieved
and is reflected in the results
announced to the market.
I made mention last year of the need
to recognise the major contribution
made by our loyal and supportive
shareholder base, particularly as
regards supporting a strategy
balancing capital growth from an
increasing share price and income
from dividends. Our strategy of buy-
and-build puts demands on our need
to look for both bank and
shareholder support particularly
where there are heavy one-off cash
demands following acquisitions. For
this reason your Board believe it is
premature to declare a dividend this
year, preferring to retain cash within
the business to fund growth and it is
my hope that our shareholders will
recognise and support this strategy
given the increase in share price over
the last 12 months.
The results with which you are now
presented are in line with market
expectation but this achievement
would not have been possible
without the total support, hard work
and commitment of our people and I
am delighted on behalf of both the
Board and our shareholders to pay
wholesome tribute to each and every
one of them.
Last year I concluded my report by
saying that the Group was in good
shape and poised to take advantage
of growth opportunities. The results
have underlined that thinking and I
am confident that 2006 will see us
equipped and ready to build on this
solid foundation continuing to grow
the Group on the same buy-and-
build strategy as we committed to
from the start.
Our vision is simple. It is to build the
Group into a major CRO expanding
into other therapies as we see the
need and opportunity and to ensure
that our shareholders are suitably
rewarded for their loyal support.

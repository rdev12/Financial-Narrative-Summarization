 Alliance & Leicester achieved all of 
its strategic objectives in 2003 and
delivered a strong set of ﬁnancial results.
Pre-tax proﬁt was up 12% to a record
£525m. Earnings per share increased 
by 16% to 79.0p, and the Board has
proposed a ﬁnal dividend of 29.6p per
share, making a total dividend of 43.9p,
an increase of 10%. Our return on 
capital increased to 22.1% as a result 
of our increased earnings and a more
efﬁcient capital base.
These results have been delivered 
against a relatively uncertain economic
backdrop during most of 2003. However
most commentators agree that the
economy enters 2004 in a stronger
position than it entered 2003. Our
current plans are based broadly on
consensus forecasts, suggesting UK 
GDP growth in 2004 of close to 3%,
compared to an out-turn of 2.1% in
2003. We expect interest rates to rise
during 2004, resulting in a modest
slowdown in the growth of consumer
expenditure during the year. 
The UK mortgage market remained 
very strong during 2003. After an
apparent easing in activity in the 
early part of the year, levels of 
lending accelerated towards the year
end. This trend leads us to expect no
signiﬁcant change in UK lending to 
our core markets of house buyers and
remortgages during 2004. We expect
house price inﬂation to continue to 
slow across the UK although, as in 
2003, there will be regional variations.
The unsecured personal loan market
forms part of the non-card consumer
credit market, which slowed in 2003,
with UK gross lending falling 5% and 
net lending falling 17% compared to
2002. We expect UK net lending to
continue to reduce in 2004. Despite 
the 5% reduction in UK gross lending 
in 2003, we achieved record unsecured
personal loan gross advances of £1.9bn
in this market, a 36% increase compared 
to 2002.
Strategic Objectives
The Group’s ultimate aim remains 
the maximisation of shareholder value. 
To deliver this goal in 2003 we had 
a primary strategic target and three
supporting objectives.
We achieved our primary strategic
target of double digit percentage
growth in earnings per share.
Basic earnings per share increased 
by 16% compared to 2002.
We have also delivered against each 
of our supporting objectives:
Achieved accelerated revenue 
growth target.
Group revenues on a like for 
like basis (excluding credit card 
income and any distortion from 
the rationalisation of properties) 
were 5.6% higher than in the 
same period in 2002, exceeding 
our target of 3.9%.

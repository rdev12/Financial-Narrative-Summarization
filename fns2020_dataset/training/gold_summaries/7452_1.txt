 4 HRG Annual Report 2011
It is often at times of
crisis and severe disruption
that our clients come to
appreciate the true
meaning of ‘travel
management’ and the
high quality of our service.
Overview
I am delighted to report on another good
year for HRG, one marked by strong
growth in revenue and earnings, on the
back of a good recovery in activity levels.
For the year ended 31 March 2011, client
travel activity increased by 17%
(1)
and spend
by 23%
(1)
. Our full-year revenue rose by 10%
and underlying operating profit by 19%.
In my statement this time last year,
I referred to the fact that, for most of us
involved in the travel industry, the key
question was how quickly corporate travel
would recover. According to the World
Travel & Tourism Council, global business
travel spend rose by an estimated 7.4% in
calendar 2010; the National Business Travel
Association estimate was 6.2%, so the
picture is broadly similar for both.
In our case, we noted the earliest signs of
an improvement during the autumn of
2009. Since then, we have seen a steady
recovery across all regions, though the
growth in corporate travel activity amongst
our clients has been strongest in Asia
Pacific and North America. Europe overall
has shown some recovery though the
pace of recovery has varied by country.
In the past year, the industry has had to
cope with a number of significant events
ranging from fuel duty rises and severe
winter weather to earthquakes, floods and
a volcanic eruption that have disrupted
travel and heightened anxiety for those
involved. Our strategy remains centred on
delivering value through excellent service
that is tailored to the specific needs of
each client. It is often at times of crisis
and severe disruption that our clients
come to appreciate the true meaning
of ‘travel management’ and the high
quality of our service.
Our clients remain focused on optimising
their travel expenditure and reducing costs.
Many of their cost-saving changes that
were imposed during the financial crisis are
still being applied. It is also fair to say that
many have moved away from the simple
mantra of cost reduction to balance value-
adding services with total cost. As a full
service provider, our technology platform
has delivered real value in the eyes of our
clients. Good examples of this are the
increasing use of online self-booking tools
and the introduction of mobile applications.
Financial results
Revenue of £358m was up 10% as
reported, or up 7% at constant exchange
rates. Underlying operating profit, which
is before the amortisation of acquired
intangibles and exceptional items, was up
by 19% to £41.9m, representing a margin
improvement from 10.8% to 11.7%.
Underlying profit before tax was up by
16% to £32.9m, and underlying EPS
increased by 16% from 6.3p to 7.3p.
After including the amortisation of acquired
intangibles and prior-year exceptional
items, reported operating profit was up by
35%, profit before tax was up by 36% and
EPS increased by 43%.
In recent years, our focus has necessarily
been on the reduction of our operating
costs as our clients reduced their travel
activity. As activity recovered, we were
careful not to add costs back into the
business until we were confident that
the trends were likely to be sustained,
and we began adding capacity in the
second half of the year (albeit at a slower
rate than we removed it) to ensure that
we could continue to deliver excellent
service and to support our continuing
growth. As a result of this disciplined
approach, average revenue per head
rose by 7% at constant currency.
As a result of strong management, year-end
net debt reduced by £16.4m to £61.1m
and represented 1.2x underlying EBITDA
(2010: 1.7x), with net external interest cover

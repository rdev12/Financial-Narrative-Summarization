Directors’ Report: Business Review
Chairman’s statement
Determined strategic implementation
This, coupled with consistent trading 
across all our markets, has enabled the 
Group to weather the unpredictable 
economic challenges of 2010. I am 
particularly pleased that our mature 
margins have started to recover during 
2010 and in addition the business has 
generated more cash year on year, with 
cash from operations increasing to £109.7 
million (2009: £105.1 million). The strength 
of this cash generation has enabled the 
business to invest signiﬁ cantly in growth, 
opening 125 centres, with an estimated 
cost to our proﬁ t and loss of £18.2 million 
and to our cash ﬂ ow of £69.7 million. It has 
also enabled us to increase our dividend 
by 22% to £23.2 million while maintaining 
a robust net cash position at £191.5 
million. The board remains conﬁ dent in the 
signiﬁ cant opportunities for our business 
as the global trend towards ﬂ exible, mobile 
work accelerates.
Network growth
To capitalise on the signiﬁ cant 
opportunities created by the trend towards 
increased ﬂ exible working we continue to 
grow our network to provide these agile 
workers with a mobile work platform. Our 
approach is two-fold: to open in new 
countries (such as Oman, Ghana and 
Lithuania), thus increasing our global 
footprint, and deepen existing in-country 
networks opening in cities (such as 
Canberra and Brasilia), thereby getting 
ever closer to new and existing customers.
In the year to 31 December 2010, we 
added 20,122 workstations an increase 
of 13% on 2009 for a total investment of 
£69.7 million. Approximately half of this 
growth came from acquisitions in markets 
such as Brazil, China, UK and USA. We 
will continue to explore such opportunities 
as we look to strengthen our market 
position and deliver on our strategy. 
Board changes
I would like to thank Ulrich Ogiermann, 
who resigned from the Board as of 
31 December 2010, for his contribution to 
the business over the years and we wish 
him well for the future. 
Dividend
It remains the intention of the Board to 
pay dividends at a level which it believes is 
sustainable throughout economic cycles 
and is in line with its progressive payment 
policy. Reﬂecting the underlying strength 
of the Group’s trading performance, our 
strong cash generation, robust cash 
position and future conﬁdence in 
the group’s prospects, the Board is 
recommending an 8% increase in the full 
year dividend per share to 2.6p per share. 
Subject to the approval of shareholders 
at the 2011 AGM, this ﬁnal dividend will 
be paid on Friday 27 May 2011 to 
shareholders on the register at the close 
of business on Tuesday 26 April 2011.

I am pleased to report

business model over 
the last two years.

Whatever a customer requires at any stage of the built environment 
life-cycle, one or more of our businesses can bring them solutions, 
individually or combined, locally or nationally. Our network of regional 
offices and our strong local relationships ensure that we can supply 
both the skills and the resources to meet customer demands,  
anytime, anywhere. 
Our market
“Kier has had another successful year in a tough 
economic environment; underlying revenue and 
profit before tax are well ahead of last year and 
cash generation has been very strong, with average 
month-end cash balances at a high level.
Our diverse skills and integrated business model 
have provided greater resilience during these 
challenging economic conditions. We are encouraged 
by the prospects we see in markets such as power 
and waste, in mixed-use regeneration and in the 
growth we see in public sector outsourcing.
Kier continues to benefit from its long-term client 
relationships and the numerous frameworks in  
which we are involved. Our network of local 
offices allows us to respond to the ever-widening 
requirement of customers for local capability to 
deliver ‘bundled’ services.
We have announced a full-year dividend of 64  
pence per share, a 10% increase on last year.  
This demonstrates the strength of our financial 
position and the confidence we have in our  
business going forward.
Although we expect the next 12 months to be 
challenging, we remain confident that our positioning 
across a wide spectrum of service areas, coupled 
with our committed and professional staff, will enable 
us to deliver a good performance in the new  
financial year.”

Chief executive

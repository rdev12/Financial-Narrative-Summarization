 Looking back on a year  
of transformational  
progress
Our transformation continues apace, with 
progress made during the year. Looking 
forward, we are approaching a crucial period 
for the Group, with the implementation  
of our new systems platform.
Introduction
This year was an important one for the 
Group, with material changes made to 
the way we operate our business and 
communicate with our customers. 
Against this backdrop of significant 
ongoing transformation within the 
business, the Board is satisfied with  
the FY16 results. 
It is hard to overestimate the amount of 
change that has occurred in the business 
over the past few years. There are new 
teams of colleagues, new skill sets and 
capabilities, new outsourcing partners 
and a focused and consolidated portfolio 
of brands. 
Of course, such a busy change agenda 
inevitably makes forecasting business 
performance harder and disruption more 
likely, and it therefore hasn’t been as 
smooth a journey as we would have 
wished. We are confident, however,  
that the right actions are being taken  
to enable us to deliver sustainable 
long-term growth as we transition  
from a direct mail to a digital business. 
This coming year will be a very important 
one for the Group. Our new IT platform 
(Fit 4 the Future) will be implemented, 
bringing necessary and significant 
improvements to all areas of our business. 
However experience suggests that a 
programme of this scale will bring some 
unexpected bumps in the road. A huge 
amount of effort has gone into planning 
and preparing to mitigate these risks.
Continued progress from direct-
mail led to digital-first, with online 
penetration of 65%, up 6ppts.
Active customer accounts +2.2% 
to 4.14m; within this Power 
Brands active customer accounts 
2.00m, up 6.9%. 
Further improvements to product 
quality, style credentials and 
promotional efficiency.
Strong USA performance, with 
revenue up 29% and the first 
profit delivered in the second half.
Our major warehouse extension 
was completed, on time and 
on budget. This new facility will 
enable us to further improve 
our already strong delivery 
proposition. 
We are also in the process of gaining our 
full FCA authorisation, following the FCA 
taking over regulation of the consumer 
credit industry from the OFT previously. 
We are well on with the process and it is 
progressing in line with expectations. 
Our Group is strong, with loyal customers 
and good margins. Once delivered, Fit 4 
the Future will give us the robust platform 
we need for growth in the future.
Dividend 
Whilst continuing to invest in the business, 
particularly on our systems programme Fit 
4 the Future and our new warehouse, we 
also continue to recognise the importance 
of cash returns to our shareholders. We 
intend to pay a final dividend of 8.56p this 
year, taking the total dividend to 14.23p, 
unchanged from FY15.

Board composition 
As I reported in last year’s annual report, 
we had a number of changes to the Board, 
and I am pleased to report that the new 
team is working well together. This year 
there is just one change to announce, 
namely that Simon Patterson stepped 
down in April 2016 to take up the same 
position at a much larger retailer. We wish 
him well and thank him for his time and 
advice. We are currently in the process  
of recruiting a replacement for Simon.
Outlook 
Consumer shopping habits are changing 
at an unprecedented rate. Online 
shopping continues to take share from 
both catalogues and physical stores at  
a pace, and those retailers who prosper 
will be those who can stay ahead of this 
ever-changing backdrop. 
As well as the traditional retail skills  
of buying, merchandising and offering 
great value to our customers, we also 
need to have exceptional data analysis 
skills, digital marketing capabilities  
and a continuously improving delivery 
proposition. Given our home shopping 
heritage we already have some 
significant in-house experience, and  
with almost two-thirds of our sales now 
coming online we are in a much stronger 
position than many of our competitors 
– but we cannot become complacent,  
we must continuously strive to improve. 
The Board is confident in the long-term 
outlook for the business and excited 
about our future growth potential. 
I would like to express my sincere thanks 
to all stakeholders in the business, and  
in particular our fantastic colleagues,  
for all their dedication, hard work and 
enthusiasm throughout the year.

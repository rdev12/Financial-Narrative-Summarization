Revenue was up by £31 million, or 1.9 per cent, to £1,720 
million. This increase is lower than the allowed regulated 
price rise for 2014/15 of 3.8 per cent nominal (1.2 per cent 
real price increase, plus 2.6 per cent RPI inflation), mainly 
reflecting the previously announced special customer 
discount which has been applied to this year’s bills.
Underlying operating profit increased by £30 million to 
£664 million, as we continue to tightly manage our cost 
base, despite the expected increase in depreciation and 
other cost pressures, including bad debt. There was also 
a planned, phased reduction in infrastructure renewals 
expenditure in the year, as we completed the five-year 
regulatory period.  
Total dividend per ordinary share for 2014/15 of 37.70 
pence. This is an increase of 4.6 per cent on last year, as we 
delivered our 2010-15 dividend policy.

Kentz Corporation Limited Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Our diversified business model, strong 
client relationships and dedicated 
workforce ensure that the outlook for  
our global operations remains positive.
OVERVIEW
Kentz has continued to make 
great progress during 2013. We have 
delivered another year of double 
digit earnings growth* due to a good 
balance of new business and natural 
growth, which is very encouraging 
given the uncertainty that abounds 
in our sector. Our diversified 
business model, our broad service 
offering and diverse geographical 
spread continued to deliver growth 
for our business. These elements, 
coupled with strong client 
relationships and dedicated 
workforce, ensure that the outlook 
for our global operations is positive. 
OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
Many people in the investment 
community are posing the question 
of what impact the reduction in 
capital investment by the large 
global oil and gas companies is 
having on our business. Although 
we monitor what is going on in the 
macro-economic environment and 
the spending plans of our larger 
clients, we place a greater emphasis 
on the specific opportunities that 
exist for our services and whether 
these opportunities are continuing  
to exist and even grow. The 18% 
growth in our pipeline of prospects 
and 19% growth in backlog in 2013 
demonstrates the growing level of 
opportunities that exist for our 
business and provides confidence 
for 2014 and beyond. We have 
achieved improved business winning 
in Australasia, Middle East and Africa 
which has contributed greatly to the 
considerable growth in our backlog.

STRATEGY
Last year, we identified six strategic 
priorities to strengthen the Company 
and position it for the longer-term. 
We remain committed to developing 
our core markets in the Middle East 
and Australia, whilst simultaneously 
focusing on broadening our value 
adding specialist capabilities and 
seeking to leverage our capabilities 
across a growing operational 
footprint. I am pleased to say that we 
have made great strides in executing 
these initiatives, but we remain very 
conscious that we still have a lot of 
ground to cover. Having been a 
significant shareholder of Kentz 
since 1994, I have seen the Company 
transformed from a small private 
company to a significant player in oil 
and gas services. The addition of 
Valerus provides a great grounding 
for further expansion of our services. 
The Board is confident in the Group’s 
strategy and we are encouraged that 
our strong workforce worldwide is 
adapting well to the changes that its 
execution entails. 
ACQUISITION OF VALERUS  
FIELD SOLUTIONS
In December, we announced the 
proposed acquisition of Valerus Field 
Solutions (Valerus) for US$435m. 
Valerus is a US-based integrated 
oil and gas surface facility solutions 
provider which provides a full suite 
of products and services from the 
well-head to the pipeline as well as 
an integrated services capability. 
Valerus focuses on adding value 
through front end and conceptual 
design, with an emphasis on turnkey 
capability and delivering projects 
quickly and efficiently. A key part of 
our strategy, which was developed 
and approved by the Board in 2012, 
was the broadening of our ability to 
provide EPC services for medium- 
sized onshore process facilities. The 
transaction received overwhelming 
support from shareholders and the 
acquisition completed on the  
3 January 2014. I would like to 
welcome the Valerus staff to the 
Kentz Group and look forward to 
their continued success. The Board 
is confident the acquisition of 
Valerus will provide significant 
strategic, operational and financial 
benefits to the Group. 
PEOPLE
As a people-based business that 
operates in many of the world’s most 
remote and challenging locations, the 
importance of recruiting, managing, 
developing and retaining our team 
is an important factor in continuing 
to deliver services for clients and 
sustaining the Company’s growth. 
With the addition of Valerus to the 
Group, we now have approximately 
14,500 employees who provide 
complex solutions for our clients and 
help operate a global organisation 
across the 36 countries in which we 
operate. On behalf of the Board, I 
would like to thank all of our staff 
members for their hard work during 
2013 and for their continued 
commitment to Kentz. 
At the next Annual General Meeting 
in May 2014, Ed Power will not seek 
re-election to the Board and will 
retire as Executive Director and Chief 
Financial Officer (CFO). Ed has been 
with Kentz since 1990 and has 
played a pivotal role in developing 
Kentz into the strong respected 
company that it is today. On behalf 
of the Board, I would like to thank Ed 
for his commitment and hard work 
over the past 23 years and wish him 
a very long and happy retirement.
I am pleased to introduce Meg 
Lassarat who will succeed Ed as 
CFO upon his retirement. Meg has 
over 20 years of global financial 
experience and has been 
instrumental in driving growth, 
identifying strategic alternatives 
and delivering positive bottom-line 
results in her career to date. Prior 
to joining Kentz, Meg was CFO of 
UniversalPegasus International, a 
professional engineering and field 
services organisation and also  
spent eight years as CFO of  
Mustang Engineering, part of 
the Wood Group.
OUTLOOK 
I am in a very fortunate position 
as Chairman of a strong growing 
company that continues to make 
great achievements year after year. 
Reports of improvements in the 
global economy and an outlook for 
2014 better than any since 2007 are 
encouraging but we must remember 
not to be complacent. Kentz is a 
service provider and our important 
clients depend on us to continually 
deliver for them. As an organisation 
we are committed to creating 
shareholder value by providing a 
high-quality service in a safe manner. 
The Board of Kentz is confident that 
the Group will continue to deliver 
value for all our stakeholders as we 
continue to broaden our offering.

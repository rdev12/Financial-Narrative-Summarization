chAIRMAN’s sTATEMENT
I am delighted to present SDI Group plc’s inaugural set of preliminary 
results since the Group’s admission to AIM on 2 July 2007. 
The results, which are ahead of market expectations despite 
a weak dollar for much of the period, cover the twelve months 
ended 30 November 2007. This was a transformation year for 
the Group which is today recognised as a leading international 
specialist in the design, build and support of bespoke integrated 
materials handling solutions for international retail, fulfilment and 
e-commerce distribution.
The admission, and in particular the restructuring of the Group 
into a single entity and brand, is already delivering tangible 
positive results with offices now collaborating on larger projects. 
The admission process was lengthy and time-consuming for senior 
management, and it is a testimony to the quality of the team that 
organic growth was delivered in the period under review. 
fINANCIALS AND kEy PERfORmANCE INDICATORS
The consolidation of Group companies complicates this year’s 
financial results. The consolidation of the Group companies 
took place on 2 July 2007 through a reverse acquisition by 
SDI Industries Inc., a privately held US based company, of the 
SDI Group which contained the remaining Group companies. 
Consequently the figures for the year ended 30 November 2007 are 
for SDI Industries Inc. (and subsidiaries) up to 2 July 2007, and for 
the Group as a whole from then onwards. The comparative figures 
for the year ended 30 November 2006 are for SDI Industries Inc. 
(and subsidiaries) only.
Therefore, in order to give a clearer indication of the Group’s 
progress over the last year, we are providing unaudited proforma 
comparison figures (note 30) for 2007 with comparative unaudited 
proforma results for 2006. These proforma figures are prepared 
on a consistent basis to the analyst research note published by 
Cenkos Securities on 28 May 2007 prior to admission. 
Reported revenue for the year ended 30 November 2007 increased 
47% to £41.3m (2006: £28.1m). Proforma Group revenue increased 
by 9% to £57.5m from £52.7m. The increase in proforma revenue 
was wholly organic. Gross profit margins increased to 25.5% 
(2006: 16.6%), (proforma 2007: 29.5% and proforma 2006: 25.9%). 
Administration expenses excluding exceptional items increased 
to £5.6m (2006: £3.0m), (proforma 2007: £9.5m and proforma 
2006: £9.4m) as a result of the increased costs associated with 
being a listed company.
Operating profit increased 19.2% to £3.8m (2006: £1.3m) 
Operating profit, before amortisation of intangibles arising on the 
business combinations and IPO costs charged to expenses 
of £1.1m, increased 279% to £4.9m (2006: £1.3m). Proforma 
operating profit increased to £7.5m (proforma 2006: £4.3m).

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007 05
Profit before tax, after amortisation of intangibles arising on the 
business combinations and IPO costs charged to expense, 
increased 147% to £4.2m from £1.7m in 2006 (proforma profit 
before tax increased 67% to £7.7m from £4.6m in 2006).
The cash position and balance sheet remains strong, with the 
Group’s cash and cash equivalents increasing to £10.1m from 
£6.0m at 30 November 2006.
DIvIDEND
On the basis of the performance this year, and reflecting our 
confidence in the future, the Board is recommending a final dividend 
of 0.9p per share, which, if approved at the Annual General Meeting, 
will be in line with market expectations. The final dividend will be paid 
on 9 June 2008 to shareholders registered at 9 May 2008.
STRATEGy The Group has continued to win contracts in existing markets with 
high profile customers across the world such as Asda George 
in the UK, M&S Mode in the Netherlands and Stage Stores 
in the US. The year has also seen project wins in new sectors 
such as automotive and healthcare including a contract win with 
Spanish healthcare service provider Logarithm.
It is our intention, whilst continuing to focus on our core market 
of non-food retail, to continue to explore new product categories where 
our products and solutions are applicable. A further opportunity is the 
growth of ‘buy at point of view’ channels which has led to a significant 
volume increase in parcel handling and the requirement for internet 
fulfilment solutions. The Group has responded to this by extending 
its solutions and software products to meet this new market and, as 
a result, has recently won a contract with Vente-Privee.com in France, 
a fashion internet retailer. 
Our maintenance support, which currently equates to around 10% 
of our business, is another key potential growth area providing 
us with an additional, consistent long term revenue stream.
Our strategy for growth also includes enhancing our international 
offering yet further by creating a presence in additional territories. 
Since the IPO, the Group has continued to develop a market 
presence in India, Germany and Brazil. At the same time, we believe 
the market in which we operate to be highly fragmented and we will 
continue to assess these consolidation opportunities as they arise.
PEOPLE
As part of the admission process the Board was reformulated. 
In addition to myself as Non-executive Chairman, I am delighted 
that Richard Arkle has joined as a Non-executive Director 
with a strong financial background. Don De Sanctis stepped 
out of day-to-day control of the US business but remains 
a Non-executive Director providing a wealth of experience of the 
industry. Mary Adams joined the Board having stepped up to replace 
Don in running the US operations.
I would like to make special mention of CEO Gordon Smith and 
CFO Gary Pyle who led the business through the admission 
and re-organisation process and have done a great job with the 
business emerging in such fine shape.
I would like to take this opportunity, on behalf of the Board, to thank 
all the employees of the Group, across the ten countries in which 
we operate, for their dedication and continuing contribution to the 
success of the Group. We are confident that we can build on the 
successes in 2007 and that we now have the right structure, 
people and strategy in place to continue to develop the business 
and achieve its full potential.
fUTURE REPORTING
The financial year end for many retailers is the end of December 
or the end of January. This can impact decision making processes at 
our primary customers on major capital expenditure. Consequently, 
the clarity of the future pipeline for our business can be obscured 
in the Group’s current reporting and planning cycle at the end of 
November. The Board has taken the decision to move the Group’s 
financial year end to 31 March. As a result, for the next financial 
period there will be two sets of interim results for the periods to 
31 May 2008 and 30 November 2008, followed by preliminary 
results for the 16 month period to 31 March 2009.
CURRENT TRADING AND OUTLOOk The Group has a strong order book as we enter 2008, although the 
benefits of this are likely to be phased towards the second half of the 
year. The services and solutions we provide are such that they can 
demonstrate real cost savings to the retail sector as they help drive 
efficiencies. As a result, we continue to see opportunities for us, even 
in a tougher high street trading environment. In addition, by looking at 
new products and new markets we believe we can continue our drive 
to grow market share in materials handling solutions for the retail, 
wholesale, e-commerce and fulfilment sectors. 
I am delighted with the Group’s progress so far and your Board 
looks forward to the forthcoming year with confidence.

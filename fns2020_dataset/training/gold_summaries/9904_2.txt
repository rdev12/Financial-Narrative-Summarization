UK
Europe
> Group turnover increased 
£21.0 million driven by the growth 
of Continental European core
household and personal care retail
sales. UK sales maintained their 2002
level while the overall reduction in
contract manufacturing sales partially
offset the gains in Europe.
> Group operating profit 
improved £5.0 million to £31.1
million (+19.2%) before goodwill
amortisation as the result of higher
sales, lower operating costs and
improving efficiency .
> Underlying cash flow generation
was £37.8 million after making
dividend payments in July 2002 and
January 2003 totalling £3.7 million.
Despite a £4.0 million adverse effect
of exchange, net debt reduced to
£61.1 million. A decrease equivalent
to one third of the Group’ s debt as 
at June 2002.
Commercial highlights 
United Kingdom
> UK sales unchanged in value terms 
as the increase in sales volume, following 
a series of successful sales promotions, was
offset by continuing price erosion resulting
from strong competition between the 
UK retailers.
> The Group‘s focus on improvements 
in manufacturing efficiency and better
controls over working capital delivered a
12.0% improvement in operating profit
with a corresponding improvement 
in cash flow.
Commercial highlights
Continental Europe
> Continental European sales increased 
by 8.6%. This success was driven by the
Group’ s strong Private Label sales growth 
in Spain, Germany , The Netherlands 
and France.
> The combination of higher sales and
operating cost improvements resulted in 
an impressive 31.6% improvement to
Continental European operating profit.

Private Label household 
and personal care products
Chairman’ s statement
The Group has achieved outstanding
results, in a year when the industry
has experienced its usual competitive
pressures. The strength of our
business emanates from the
consistency and relevance of our
strategy: focus on Private Label
household and personal care,
innovate, support and develop with
our major customers, emphasis on
customer service and maintaining
industry leading management skills
and experience. All elements of the
strategy have contributed to this
year’ s strong performance.
Key Strategic Strengths
The Group has achieved outstanding results, 
in a year when the industry has experienced 
its usual competitive pressures. Our
commitment to innovative solutions across 
all facets of the business has again ensured
success. This contrasts with many of our UK 
and Continental European competitors, some
of whom have struggled to achieve acceptable
performances. The strength of our business
emanates from the consistency and relevance 
of our strategy: focus on Private Label
household and personal care, innovate, 
support and develop with our major 
customers, emphasis on customer service 
and maintaining industry leading management
skills and experience. All elements of the
strategy have contributed to this year’ s 
strong performance. 
Recently we were again at the forefront of
product innovation when we launched laundry
powder in soluble sachets in the UK.
Continued Improvement in Performance
The programmes of action that were introduced
by the executive team in 2001 continue to
produce improvements in performance. During
the year , all the businesses have been focussed
on maximising profitable sales supported by
improvements in the key areas of
manufacturing efficiency , productivity , asset
utilisation and working capital management.
The success of these actions is demonstrated 
by record sales, increased margins and cash
generation that has enabled us to reduce
borrowing to the lowest level in seven years.
It is pleasing that this improved all round
performance continues to be recognised in 
the recovery of our share price which currently
stands at 109.5 pence per share as at 10
September 2003. We see no reason at present
why the improvement should not continue in
the current financial year .
Aerosol Products Limited (APL)
APL the UK aerosol joint venture, based at Hull, 
had a successful year by applying the same
basic strategy and improvement plan as the
main business. Following last year’ s operational
and financial restructuring the management 
has worked hard, achieving a turnaround 
from loss to an operating profit. 
With customer confidence at higher levels, 
new business has been gained and new
opportunities continue to arise.

McBride plc
The market leaders
Lord Sheppard
Chairman
Customer Relationships
Being a supplier of Private Label means that 
we are directly affected by the economic and
competitive forces experienced by retailers. 
We are only able to succeed by being more
responsive to and, when necessary , proactive
with, our retail customers than other suppliers.
Recognition of our success was referred 
to last year when McBride UK won 
The Grocer magazine’ s ’Best in Class’ for a
second consecutive year . This year we went 
two better , and were awarded ‘Best in Class’ 
for a record third time. In addition McBride 
was voted The Grocer’ s inaugural Gold Medal 
for Own Label excellence.
Workforce
It is with pride and gratitude that I give
recognition to the outstanding commitment 
of our staff during the year .
Additional Non-Executives
As indicated in last year’ s Annual Report, we
announced the intention to strengthen the
Board. Following the recent press
announcement, Christine Bogdanowicz-Bindert
and Robert Lee have been appointed to the
Board of McBride plc as non-executive directors
from 1 September 2003. They bring with them
considerable expertise and I would like to take
this opportunity to welcome them to the 
Board of McBride plc.
Dividend Policy
McBride plc is committed to making
progressive, sustainable annual increases to 
the dividend paid to shareholders, taking
account of the medium-term capital
requirements of the business.
Dividends will be paid in relation to the 
interim and final results of each financial year in
May and November respectively . It is anticipated 
that the interim dividend will be approximately
one third of the total dividend for a year .
Current T rading
Since year end trading has further improved 
in line with expectations and the outlook
remains encouraging.
The Group continues to be the most
comprehensively positioned EU supplier 
not only of household and personal care
products but of any Private Label product
category sold through Grocers.
Managing powerful manufacturing and distribution 
resources across a continent, within a dynamic, fast-moving
company culture, is enabling McBride to stretch its lead as
Europe’ s leading Private Label specialist. It’ s our ability to meet
our customers’ demands across Europe that makes McBride 
the preferred partner of so many major retailers.

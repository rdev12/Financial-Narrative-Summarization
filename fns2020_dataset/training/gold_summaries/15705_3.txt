 Chairman’s statement
2 Tibbett & Britten Group plc Annual report and ﬁnancial statements 2003
Good progress at our European and International divisions was
overshadowed by the unsatisfactory performance of our Americas
operations. In Europe, our successful development reflected the
benefits we are now realising from the restructuring of the UK business
implemented in 2002 and the new management structure put in place
last year. The International division performed well, particularly 
in South Africa and with sustained growth in China.
In North America we have restructured the business following the management changes announced
at the end of last year. Overheads have been substantially reduced and development realigned 
to deliver better consistency and performance from the market leading positions we have achieved
after 12 years of unbroken growth.
The business is a global leader ﬁrmly focused within consumer logistics. As such, it is strategically
well positioned to sustain growth in our core European and Americas markets whilst capitalising 
on our established presence in Central Europe and China at a time when the May 2004 EU
accessions and the adoption of the World Trade Agreement accelerate supply change and
migration of production.
Financial results
Reported turnover was up 8% at £1,634m (2002 – £1,517m) and reported operating proﬁt was
£22.4m (2002 – £26.3m) reﬂecting the impact of one off events in the ﬁrst half and an unsatisfactory
performance in the second half in North America and Mexico. Pre-tax proﬁts were £2.2m better 
at £15.5m, as 2002 was impacted by exceptional items. Accordingly, basic earnings per share
improved to 20.2 pence per share (2002 – 5.4 pence per share). Adjusted earnings per share were
29.1 pence (2002 – 38.7 pence). The Group’s operations remain strongly cash generative with
operating cash inﬂow of £52.3m (2002 – £74.6m). 2002 cash ﬂow beneﬁted from the receipt of 
the outstanding Safeway receivable of £17.5m. Free cash ﬂow, after the payment of interest and
taxation, was £31.0m (2002 – £44.1m). Net debt was £50.8m (2002 – £67.2m) at the year-end.
Dividend
The Board is recommending maintaining the full year dividend of 25.3 pence per ordinary share
(2002 – 25.3 pence). Therefore, for the year ended 31 December 2003, it is recommended that 
a ﬁnal dividend of 17.1 pence per ordinary share (2002 – 17.4 pence) be paid on 28 May 2004 
to shareholders on the register at 7 May 2004. The proposed dividend is covered 1.15 times by
earnings before goodwill amortisation and loss on investment (2002 – 1.53 times). It is the Board’s
intention to rebuild dividend cover as earnings grow.

Management
Mike Sprague resigned from the Board and as President of our Americas Division on 6 January
2004. I would like to thank him for his contribution to developing our Americas business over 
the last ten years. We are currently in the process of recruiting a successor.
After 47 years in the industry and 35 with this business, I shall be retiring as Chairman at the 
end of this year. The nominations committee, which comprises myself and the three independent
non-executive directors, have put in place a process, working with search consultants, to identify 
a suitable successor who will lead the Board and will work closely with Mike Arrowsmith and his
executive team. 
Edward Buchan, the senior non-executive director, will step down in May at the AGM. Edward
joined the Board in 1996 and currently heads the audit committee. On behalf of all my colleagues, 
I thank him for his support and counsel over the last eight years.
Outlook
The underlying growth drivers for supply chain change and outsourcing underpin growth and
opportunity in all our markets, although cost and margin compression are an increasing trading
issue. Our strategic focus and scale enable us to exploit the opportunities inherent in the
increasing complexity of extended supply chain management and so mitigate the impact 
of competitive pressures.
The business is exceptionally well positioned to exploit growth opportunities within our core markets
and beyond. After the events of last year, operations in the Americas are projected to recover
strongly, following the restructuring of their overhead base at a cost of approximately £2.0m.
In Western Europe we continue to inﬁll in the major markets, notably in our non-food operations.
The accession in May this year of ten, primarily Central and Eastern European, countries to the
enlarged European Union will be a catalyst accelerating change. We are positioned to capitalise 
on our established presence in the Central European markets. Similarly, for six years we have 
been building critical mass in China within a rapidly developing consumer sector. The effect of 
the WTA will be to accelerate change in both global sourcing and the domestic Chinese market.
We will beneﬁt from both, including the development of offshore supply chain services.

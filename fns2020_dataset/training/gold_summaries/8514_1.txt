 I am pleased to report a good set of results. While the 
global construction market continues to be challenging, 
there have been signs of recovery in our key sectors 
and geographies and the company is continuing  
to perform well.

For	the	year	ended	30	June	2011,

In	the	period	the	Gr oup	r epaid	£5.1m

Overview
Key	featur es	of	our	business	during	the	
year	included:
		W e	have	won	work	during	the	year	
totalling 	 £1,204m 	 (2010: 	 £892m) 	 enabling	
us	to	finish	the	year	with	our	best	ever	
total	r evenue	–	up	by	23%,	in	a	highly	
competitive 	 and 	 challenging 	 envir onment.
		As	we	anticipated,	we	have	seen	
r ecovery	in	some	of	our	private	sector	
markets.	W e	continue	to	deliver	pr ojects	
for	an	enviable	blue	chip	client	base.
		Our	UK	Fit	Out	division	gr ew	r evenues	
by	32%	to	£342m	(2010:	£260m),	and	
continues	to	win	market	shar e.
		The	London	office	fit	out	market	
impr oved,	albeit	with	fewer	lar ge-scale	
pr ojects.	W e	expect	the	tr end	for	smaller	
pr ojects	to	continue	in	the	curr ent	year	
with	the	demand	for	lar ge-scale	works	
likely	to	r etur n	in	2013.	
		Our	r etail	businesses	have	performed	
str ongly	with	r evenue	fr om	the	sector	
incr easing	to	£345m	(2010:	£258m).	
Ther e	is	incr eased	demand	fr om	our	
r etail 	 banking 	 clients 	 and 	 our 	 Food 	 Retail	
division	has	seen	its	r evenues	nearly	
double	compar ed	to	the	pr evious	year .
		Inter nationally ,	we	have	seen	volumes	
incr ease	as	inter national	customers	
r ecommence	their	capital	pr ogrammes.	
However ,	the	overseas	r esults	wer e	
impacted	by	our	Continental	Eur ope	Fit	
Out	division	which	would	have	made	
a	pr ofitable	contribution	but	for	a	lar ge	
loss	on	a	challenging	pr oject	for	a	 
key	customer .	
		In	the	Middle	East	ther e	was	a	very	
str ong	performance	with	a	good	second	
half 	 to 	 the 	 year 	 as 	 international 	 companies	
r etur ned	to	Dubai	and	Abu	Dhabi.
		In	Asia,	our	performance	fell	short	of	
the 	 prior 	 year , 	 as 	 r evenues 	 only 	 started 	 to	
impr ove	late	in	the	final	quarter .	In	April	
2011,	we	completed	the	acquisition	 
of	Realys	Gr oup	Limited	(Realys),	a	
design-led 	 pr oject 	 management 	 business	
b a s e d 	 in	Shanghai.	
		Against	the	market	tr end,	our	
Construction	division	has	had	a	str ong	
year .	It	has	continued	to	r educe	its	
exposur e	to	the	public	sector	and	its	
performance	on	high-pr ofile	pr ojects	
such	as	the	London	2012	V elodr ome	
has	str engthened	its	r eputation	for	
excellent	delivery .	The	exception	was	
our	South	W est	business	which	was	
slow	to	r espond	to	market	conditions.
		Our	commitment	as	a	company	is	to	
pr ovide	consistency	of	delivery	to	all	
our	customers	r egar dless	of	geography ,	
service 	 line 	 or 	 business 	 sector . 	 T o 	 support	
and	drive	this,	we	have	simplified	our	
brand	identity .
		As	a	people	business	we	continue	
to	focus	on	the	development	of	our	
employees.	During	the	year	we	wer e	
awar ded	“Investors	in	People”	status	
acr oss	our	UK	operations.	Our	ongoing	
strategy 	 of 	 str engthening 	 our 	 management	
inter nationally	will	continue.

La Défense is the latest in a 
number of projects I have had 
the pleasure of working on 
for Foot Locker. Working for 
an internationally recognised 
brand demands consistency 
across every project. It gives 
me great satisfaction to say 
that we have achieved this 
once again on this store.

UK Fit Out
The	r ecovery	of	the	UK	fit	out	market	
continued,	with	r evenues	up	by	32%	
to	£342m	(2010:	£260m).	This	str ong

(2010: 	 £6.3m), 	 r esulting 	 in 	 mar gins 	 slightly	
down	at	2.3%	(2010:	2.4%).
In	the	year	we	successfully	completed	
the	320,000	sq	ft	fit	out	of	Man	Gr oup’ s	
Riverside	House.	The	£38m	pr oject	was	
one	of	the	industry’ s	lar gest	London	fit

70,000 	 sq 	 ft 	 UK 	 headquarters 	 – 	 the 	 fastest

In	the	short-term,	the	pipeline	has	
diminished	for	major	fit	out	pr ojects	in	
the 	 corporate 	 office 	 sector 	 and 	 our 	 focus 	
continues 	 on 	 medium-sized 	 assignments.	
Ther e	is	also	an	incr eased	demand	for 
infrastructure upgrades to improve 
efficiency 	 and 	 also 	 meet 	 the 	 r equir ements 	
of	the	UK	Gover nment’ s	CRC	Ener gy	
Efficiency	Scheme.	T o	capitalise	on	our	
position	as	a	leader	in	this	niche	market,	
we	have	incr eased	our	specialised	
Engineering	service	of fering	in	the	 
period	and	we	have	alr eady	completed	 
a	substantial	mission	critical	pr oject	for	
The	Royal	Bank	of	Scotland	(RBS).	
W e	expect	major	fit	out	opportunities	in	
the	corporate	office	sector	to	incr ease	
in	the	second	half	of	2012	as	the	curr ent	
wave	of	developments	in	central	London

Our	success	in	the	market	for	the	r etail	
banking	fit	out	sector	continued	with	a	
very	str ong	performance	–	in	particular ,	
our	work	under	framework	agr eements.	
W e	ar e	on	the	frameworks	of	Bar clays

RBS 	 and 	 HSBC 	 and 	 the 	 year 	 has 	 seen 	 us

pr ojects	include	the	delivery	of	Lloyds’	
and	RBS’ s	flagship	outlets	in	London’ s	
W estfield	Stratfor d	shopping	centr e.	
On	the	high	str eet,	our	fit	out	of	the	
world’ s	lar gest	shoe	department	in	
London’ s	Selfridges	hit	the	headlines.	
The	vast	space	–	which	is	bigger	than	
T ate	Moder n’ s	T urbine	Hall	–	showcases	
over	5,000	pairs	of	shoes	fr om	120	
brands.	W e	ar e	also	delivering	our	first

the	business	has	been	awar ded	a	new	
framework	appointment	with	the	UK’ s

Everything	Everywher e.
At 	 the 	 year 	 end 	 our 	 UK 	 Fit 	 Out 	 business	 
had 	 an 	 or der 	 book 	 of 	 £170m 	 (2010: 	 £172m),	
all 	 of 	 which 	 is 	 to 	 be 	 deliver ed 	 in 	 the 	 curr ent

base	and	r evenues	have	incr eased	
significantly	over	the	year	by	122%	to	
£73m	(2010:	£33m).	The	division	would	
have	made	a	pr ofitable	contribution	
but	for	an	unexpected	loss	on	a	lar ge,	
challenging	pr oject	for	a	key	customer	
in	Geneva,	which	has	r esulted	in	it	
r eporting	a	loss.

a range of stores for Foot Locker across

ExxonMobil,	Disney	Studios	and	Bank

At	year	end	our	or der	book	stood	at	
£20m	(2010:	£32m),	all	of	which	is	to

Middle East Fit Out
After	dissolving	our	joint	ventur e	
arrangement 	 in 	 the 	 Middle 	 East 	 as 	 of 	 1 	 July	
2010	we	have	operated	a	business	that	
focuses 	 exclusively 	 on 	 fit 	 out. 	 The 	 division 	
is	now	operating	very	successfully	–	in	
line 	 with 	 the 	 r eturning 	 confidence 	 we 	 have 	
seen 	 in 	 the 	 Dubai 	 and 	 Abu 	 Dhabi 	 markets.	
In 	 the 	 period 	 it 	 generated 	 r evenue 	 of 	 £20m	
and 	 made 	 a 	 positive 	 contribution 	 of 	 £0.7m 
(2010: 	 loss 	 of 	 £0.3m). 	 Pr ojects 	 in 	 the 	 period	
included 	 work 	 for 	 Siemens, 	 Philips, 	 Pfizer 	
and	ExxonMobil,	and	most	significantly	
we	have	won	five	of	the	initial	fit	out	
pr ojects 	 in 	 Sowwah 	 Squar e, 	 wher e 	 a 	 new	
financial 	 centr e 	 is 	 being 	 cr eated 	 adjacent 	
to	the	Abu	Dhabi	Stock	Exchange.
The	or der	book	at	the	end	of	the	period

Our 	 Construction 	 division 	 has 	 had 	 a 	 highly	
successful	year .	Despite	the	difficult 
economic	envir onment,	r evenues	have 
r emained 	 stable 	 at 	 £476m 	 (2010: 	 £474m).	
Operating	pr ofit	decr eased	to	£2.7m	
(2010:	£5.6m)	due	to	the	impact	of	the 
South	W est	business	being	slow	to 
r espond 	 to 	 mor e 	 difficult 	 market 	 conditions 
as	well	as	the	incr eased	competitive	
envir onment 	 generally 	 in 	 the 	 UK, 	 r esulting

with	Boris	Johnson,	Lor d	Coe	and

Also	in	 the 	UK,	whilst	 the 	private	sector

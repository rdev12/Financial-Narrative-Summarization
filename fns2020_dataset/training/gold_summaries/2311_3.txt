Booker g roup 
plc has delivered 
another strong 
performance.
i am pleased to report that Booker 
group plc has delivered another 
good performance. in the 52 weeks 
to 23 March 2012 sales rose by 7.3% 
and operating proﬁt was up 16% as 
customer satisfaction continued to 
improve. the ﬁnancial performance was 
good and the group ended the year (53 
weeks to 30 March 2012) with net cash 
of £63.4m. the drive into the catering 
market is working, with like-for-like sales 
to caterers up by 6.1% and sales to 
retailers up by 6.1%. 
the plans to ‘Broaden’ the business are 
going well. We have converted 142 of 
our 172 business centres in the UK to 
the ‘Extra’ format – the lighter, brighter, 
more modern format. in the 52 weeks 
Booker distributed £1,053m of product 
to our customers’ premises this year 
versus £930m last year and we continue 
to expand our delivered offering with 
the launch of Chef Direct. internet sales 
were £635m compared to £526m in the 
previous year and Booker india is making 
good progress. 
i should like to thank all our colleagues 
for their contribution to the success of the 
group in the year just ended.
Basic earnings per share were 4.83 
pence up from 3.90 pence last year. 
given the strong operational performance 
of the business, the Board recommends 
the payment of a ﬁnal dividend of 1.95 
pence per share (2011: 1.40 pence per 
share) which, together with the interim 
dividend, makes a total dividend for the 
year of 2.28 pence per share (2011: 1.67 
pence per share). the ﬁnal dividend is 
payable on 20 July 2012 to shareholders 
on the register on 8 June 2012.
Outlook
the economy is expected to remain 
challenging in the year ahead and the 
food wholesale market remains very 
competitive. Nevertheless, we expect to 
continue to make progress in this difﬁcult 
environment. Booker has made a good 
start to the current ﬁnancial year even 
compared to the very strong perfomance 
in the ﬁrst seven weeks of last year and, in 
spite of the fact that tobacco sales have 
been slow, we remain on course to meet 
our expectations for the year.
Annual General Meeting
Our annual general Meeting will be held 
on 18 July 2012. the notice of annual 
general Meeting separately accompanies 
this document.

statement
Overview
2010 was an encouraging year for Lupus despite the building 
products markets in the US, UK and Europe continuing to show 
little growth. Our strategy of self help involving focused customer 
service, tight cost control, supply chain efficiencies and 
management of working capital has enabled the Group to gain 
market share and make further progress in what remains a highly 
competitive environment. Gall Thomson, our Oil and Gas Services 
business, enjoyed another year of excellent performance.
During the year the Group appointed a new executive team in 
Louis Eperjesi and James Brotherton, completing the Board 
restructuring that began in 2009.
The Board is pleased that the Group is now in a position to 
resume dividend payments to shareholders reflecting the 
improved operational performance of the Group, underpinned  
by consistent cash conversion.
2011 is not expected to deliver material improvement in conditions 
in building products markets and significant input cost pressures 
are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. However  
our strong market positions combined with our balance sheet 
strength, quality of product and service offering and focus on 
market share growth through self help initiatives means that the 
Group is well positioned to maintain margins and take advantage 
of any sustained increase in activity levels.
Financial performance in the period
Total sales of £266.2 million increased by 10.2 per cent. from prior 
year (2009: £241.6 million). In constant currency terms on a like for 
like basis, total sales increased in the year by 12.4 per cent. 
Despite challenging trading conditions and increasing raw material 
costs, the Group’s gross profit margin increased to 34.9 per cent. 
from 33.3 per cent. in 2009. The Dropthrough Margin on 
incremental sales for the year was 32.8 per cent. Underlying 
operating profit increased by 31.6 per cent. to £33.7 million (2009: 
£25.6 million). Underlying earnings per share increased by 3.67 
pence or 39.1 per cent. to 13.06 pence (2009: 9.39 pence).
During the year the Group continued to focus on the tight 
management of working capital, operational cash generation and 
the reduction of net debt. Despite the 10.2 per cent. increase in 
sales, in 2010 the Group generated £1.7 million cash from net 
working capital reductions (2009: £10.7 million). Operating Cash  05

balance sheet strength and capital investment plans, as well  
as the requirement to comply with the terms of the Group’s  
facility agreements.
The final dividend of 2.0 pence (2009: Nil pence) per share is 
recommended for payment on 7 June 2011 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 3 May 2011. The ex-dividend 
date will be 27 April 2011.
Outlook
Our Building Products division has made a steady start to 2011, 
with sales and orders broadly in line with 2010, although the 
seasonal nature of the businesses and short order books means 
that the first quarter offers little visibility on the full year.
2011 is not expected to deliver material improvement in conditions 
in our key building products markets and significant input cost 
pressures are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. 
However our strong market positions, combined with balance 
sheet strength, quality of product and service offering and focus 
on market share growth through self help initiatives means that the 
Group is well positioned to take advantage of any sustained 
increase in activity levels.
Our Oil and Gas Services Division continues to see increasing 
demand for its MBC and industrial coupling products and has a 
very strong order book coming into 2011.
We expect the Group will continue to make further progress during 
2011 from a sound financial platform.

Conversion, being the proportion of Underlying operating profit 
converted into cash, exceeded 100 per cent. at 105 per cent. in 
2010 (2009: 142 per cent.). During 2010 the Group repaid £21.1 
million of debt, to bring the total debt repayments made since the 
refinancing in July 2009 to £41.4 million. At 31 December 2010 the 
Group’s Underlying Net Debt was £94.7 million, which was £21.5 
million lower than prior year (2009: £116.2 million),
Board
There were a number of changes to the Board during the year. 
Louis Eperjesi was appointed as Chief Executive Officer in 
February 2010 and James Brotherton was appointed as Chief 
Financial Officer in May 2010. There are three independent 
non-executive directors, Jamie Pike (Chairman), Les Tench and 
Martin Towers.
James Brotherton was appointed as a Director after the 2010 
Annual General Meeting and so is required to offer himself for 
re-election at the 2011 Annual General Meeting. In accordance with 
best practice, the Board have agreed that each Director will 
voluntarily offer themselves for re-election at each Annual General 
Meeting that they are not required to retire from office. Accordingly, 
Jamie Pike, Louis Eperjesi, Les Tench and Martin Towers will 
voluntarily offer themselves for re-election at the 2011 Annual 
General Meeting.
Dividends
Lupus is a cash generative business operating in mature markets 
and, in the ordinary course, would expect to pay a regular dividend 
to shareholders. The banking arrangements entered into in June 
2009 precluded the payment of dividends by the Group until both 
Group and subsidiary net debt ratios had reduced.
Over the past two financial years the focus of the Group has been 
on deleveraging the balance sheet and utilising surplus cash in the 
permanent paydown of debt. The outcome of this focus is a 
significantly strengthened balance sheet, underpinned by 
sustained trading performance and means that the Group now has 
the consent of its banks to make a modest dividend payment. 
Accordingly the Board is recommending to shareholders the 
payment of a final dividend of 2.0 pence per share. The final 
dividend will absorb approximately £2.6 million of cash resources.
Over time the absolute level of future dividend payments will  
take into account the Group’s underlying earnings, cash flows,

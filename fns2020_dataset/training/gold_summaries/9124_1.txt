Pro Evolution Soccer
“World Soccer Winning Eleven”:
is a series of football video games
developed and published by Konami.
Every year, the game is released around
late September and/or early October
with two diﬀerent titles: World Soccer:
Winning Eleven in Japan, and Pro
Evolution Soccer in other countries. 
The Japanese version is a localized
version that features local leagues. 
In 2007, the franchise began to use the
name “Winning Eleven: Pro Evolution
Soccer” for the American market, which
was later changed to “Pro Evolution
Soccer” in 2008, dropping the “Winning
Eleven” moniker entirely for that region.

Dutch Chief Executive’s review
12 Keywords Studios plc – Annual Report 2014
2013 was a year in which we invested in the business in the expectation
that the next generation console launches, in combination with games
development for the installed console base as well as social and mobile
platforms would underpin a substantial increase in activity levels 
during the ﬁnancial year.
o verview
The unexpected scale back in the
number of next generation launch
territories, combined with delays to
some earlier generation games releases
due to the industry’s focus on the two
major console releases at the very end
of the year, held margins back in 2013.
However, we are now well positioned 
to take advantage of this investment;
2014 and 2015, are expected to be
periods of signiﬁcant activity for the
games industry as it beneﬁts more fully
from the new generation of consoles 
in line with the growth in the installed
base for these devices.
Overall, despite the uncertainty in the
industry, we delivered strong revenue
growth and have made considerable
progress in line with our strategy to
expand the Group’s oﬀering both
organically and by acquisition.
2013 ﬁnancial performance
highlights
The Group’s revenues increased by 
14% to €16.39m (2012: €14.34m) during
the period. This increase was primarily
driven by our largest service line,
Localisation Testing, which grew by 
21% whilst Localisation Activities, grew
marginally, by 2%, and Audio and
Functional Testing, grew by 23.3% as
outlined in more detail in the
operational review.
Operating expenses includes one-time
costs relating to the IPO of €1.12m
(2012: €nil) and non-cash costs related
to share option expenses of €0.07m
(2012: €nil). Operating expenses
excluding these two items increased by
a total of €0.54m for the period to
€3.25m (2012: €2.71m) arising from our
investment in expansion and increased
capacity. In particular, this reﬂected a
€0.19m increase in operating costs in
Montreal and Seattle as we expanded
our Localisation and Testing capacity,
and €0.28m incremental costs in the
Company related to the new Board and
the compliance costs of being a public
company. The depreciation expense
increased by €0.07m arising from the
Group’s continued modest investment
in testing equipment.
Whilst prices for the Company’s services
have mostly remained unchanged
during 2013, our investment in
additional capacity ahead of anticipated
higher levels of activity in the second half
of 2013 as well as in start up costs in 
our Managed Services operation in
Seattle led to Gross Proﬁt Margins for
the continuing businesses being held
back to 34.6% (2012: 38.5%).
One-time costs of €1.40m (2012: nil)
were incurred in the year, relating to
expenses associated with the Group’s
IPO on 12 July 2013. €0.28m of this was
capitalised against the share premium
account, with the balance of €1.12m
included in operating expenses. 
The Group reported adjusted proﬁt
before tax (before IPO expenses, share
option charges and foreign currency
movements) for 2013 of €2.45m (2012:
€2.85m). Statutory proﬁt before tax for
the period was €1.16m (2012: €2.74m). 
The average tax rate on the proﬁt before
taxation (excluding losses before tax) in
the period was 14.8% (2012: 13.1%). The
increase is due to higher tax rates in the
USA on the Group’s Seattle operations. 
The basic earnings per share, excluding
the one-time costs of the IPO, were 5.28c
(2012: 7.30c). Basic earnings per share
from continuing operations were 2.14c. 
o perational review
During the year, the Group continued to
grow its market share and build on its
strong reputation for quality of service
and delivery, from secure facilities, as
evidenced by an excellent client
retention record and client wins, which
include Blizzard Entertainment, Disney,
King and Supercell.

Business overview
We have achieved a leadership position in 
the offshore and inspection industry through
offering one of the widest selections of
products available from one source in the
industry . We are also expanding outside 
the oil and gas industries into the onshore
non-destructive testing and remote visual
inspection equipment markets. We believe
our environmental business will also play 
an increasingly important role.

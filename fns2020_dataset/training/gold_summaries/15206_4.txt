Overview
d
2
w is a masterbatch system which, 
when included at the manufacturing 
stage, turns ordinary plastic at the end 
of its useful life into a material with a 
different molecular structure. At that 
stage it is no longer a plastic and has 
become a material which is inherently 
biodegradable in the open environment 
in the same way as a leaf.

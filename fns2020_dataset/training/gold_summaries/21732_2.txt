Product development:

skirts and lingerie
• Continued strategic focus on the ‘de-weathering’ of coats and knitwear ranges 
and new range of clothing developed, ‘wardrobe favourites’
Channels to market:
• Opened a net 20 new locations, contributing to £4.7m additional sales
• Ongoing replacement of store fascias, due for completion FY17
• Improved stock delivery service to stores 
Systems and processes:

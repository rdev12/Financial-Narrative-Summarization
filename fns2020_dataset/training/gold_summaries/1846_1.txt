GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
W
ith a rapidly improving 
performance across 
the Group we have 
made substantial 
progress in achieving our 
objectives of rebuilding profitability 
and reducing overall indebtedness.
In the year, we have achieved 
a 14. 1% increase in revenues, 
a 1.6% increase in operating 
margins before operating 
exceptional costs, a 159.3% 
increase in pre-exceptional pre-tax 
profits and we have almost halved 
our net debt. Despite continued 
uncertainty surrounding the wider 
UK market and constrained levels 
of mortgage finance, we expect 
to make further good progress 
in 2012/13 with more than half 
our completions forecast to be 
delivered from recently acquired 
higher margin land.

(2011: £2,035.4m), with 
completions (excluding joint 
ventures) up 14.1% to 
12,637 units. We have enjoyed 
more stable trading conditions 
throughout the year and were 
able to deliver a strong start to 
our second half following a small 
improvement in mortgage lending.
We have seen higher sales rates 
as an increasing proportion of 
completions are being delivered 
from our more recently acquired 
sites. As at 30 June 2012, we had a 
substantially strengthened forward 
sales position, with private forward 
sales (excluding joint ventures) up 
35.5% to £366.9m (201 1: £270.8m).
Profit from operations before 
operating exceptional items 
increased by 41.6% from £135.0m 
to £191.1m, with a significant 
improvement in operating margin 
before operating exceptional items 
to 8.2% (2011: 6.6%) for the 
full year and to 9.5% (2011: 7 .9%) 
in the second half. Profit  
before tax and exceptional  
items increased by 159.3%  
to £110.7m (2011: £42.7m).
In the year we reported 
exceptional items of £10.7m, 
relating to the acquisition  
of a partner’s 50% interest 
in a residential development, 
consequently profit before tax 
after exceptional items was 
£100.0m (2011: loss £11.5m).
Our improved operational 
efficiency, continued tight control 
over the timing of land expenditure 
and working capital commitments, 
and receipts from land sales 
enabled us to reduce net debt 
to £167 .7m as at 30 June 2012 
(2011: £322.6m).
Our objectives
Our strategic objectives remain 
clear – to rebuild profitability and 
reduce overall indebtedness – 
and we have made considerable 
progress in both of these areas 
during the year.
We have set out three priorities 
to enable us to rebuild profitability:
•	 optimise selling prices;
•	improve operational efficiency; and
•	 deliver targeted land buying.
Optimise selling prices
We have embedded disciplines 
within the organisation to ensure 
we continue to focus on securing 
the best price for every sale – 
thereby maximising value rather 
than just driving volumes.
Average selling prices 
increased to £180,500 (2011: 
£178,300), with private average 
selling prices increasing by 1.5% 
to £201,800 (2011: £198,900), 
driven by a small positive change 
in mix. Overall, underlying prices 
have remained broadly stable, 
with continued variations by 
region. There is, in particular, 
a greater robustness in pricing 
in London and the South East.
During the year we had higher 
sales rates across the Group with 
average net private reservations 
per active site per week increasing 
to 0.52 (2011: 0.44). Sales rates 
have been more consistent during 
 Our strategic 
objectives remain clear 
– to rebuild profitability 
and reduce overall 
indebtedness – and 
we have made 
considerable progress 
in both of these areas 
during the year.

GROUP OVERVIEW • GROUP CHIEF  
EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
the year reflecting a greater stability 
in market conditions than we have 
seen for some time. We saw 
a particularly strong start to the 
2012 spring selling season and 
took advantage of this to deliver 
additional completions from  
our older, lower margin land.
Our sales strategy is focused 
on offering our customers the 
highest quality products and 
service. For the third year running 
we have achieved the HBF’s 
5-Star status, meaning that more 
than 90% of our customers were 
satisfied with the service they 
received. Our site managers 
have won more NHBC ‘Pride in 
the Job’ awards than any other 
housebuilder for the eighth 
year running.
Both the Barratt and David 
Wilson house ranges have been 
re-designed and updated following 
customer research to be even 
more attractive to potential buyers. 
We now have the new house types 
on 125 of our developments.
We continue to focus on 
our predominantly web-based 
marketing strategy with our Barratt 
Homes and David Wilson Homes 
websites receiving on average 
around 160,000 visits per week. 
Our online presence has been 
substantially enhanced through 
the launch of our new look 
websites, which give consumers 
significantly more information 
about individual properties and 
the locality, as well as additional 
services such as mortgage 
calculators and school finders.
Improve operational 
efficiency
Driving operational efficiency 
has remained a significant focus 
for the Group. We continue to 
retain a firm control on costs, 
in particular capitalising on our 
scale and technical resources 
to maximise efficiency.
Our supply contracts for 
materials continue to be reviewed 
and renegotiated as appropriate, 
and we purchase an increasingly 
significant proportion of our 
materials centrally.  BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 11
CASE STUDY 
Delivering new land
At the edge of Coxhoe, a former mining village south of Durham,  
you will find our development ‘The Limes’, comprising 80 attractive 
houses with a mix of 2, 3 and 4 bedroom homes of traditional and 
contemporary design.
Today’s bright future for the site, with both new housing and 
commercial use, disguises its chequered past. The site had remained 
derelict since 1980 after the closure of the Steetley Lime Works, which 
opened prior to the First World War. Before this, the site had also been 
used for mining and as a railway siding.
To develop the site was a challenge. Detailed investigations confirmed 
that the ground contained demolition debris and spoil heaps, underlain 
by glacial clays and coal seams, which had previously been worked at 
shallow depth.
Working in partnership with another local developer, we obtained 
planning permission for a mixed use development, and a comprehensive 
remediation programme was completed. This included the removal 
of contaminated debris, earthworks, the treatment of contaminated soil 
on site and the removal of Japanese Knotweed. A clay capping layer and 
top soil for the public open space and garden areas were also provided.
Today, ‘The Limes’ is set to become a thriving community. 
Coxhoe Village has a range of local amenities, including a school, 
shops and a medical centre, and it is also close to the A1(M) motorway 
for easy access to the major 
business centres of the North 
East and further afield. The 
good location and the quality 
of the development mean that, 
as at 30 June 2012, 36 of the 
houses have been sold and 
just over a third of the homes 
already occupied. 1

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
GROUP OVERVIEW • GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
We continue to review our 
supply chain to create efficiencies 
by introducing new suppliers and 
altering build specifications where 
appropriate. Standard house-type 
costs are benchmarked across 
the Group continuously to ensure 
the lowest cost is achieved 
whilst maintaining the quality 
of our homes.
Going forward, it is likely that 
some pressure will continue to be 
felt as raw material prices rise due 
to underlying commodity price 
increases. However, we will seek 
to mitigate this by continuing to 
drive further efficiency savings 
and reductions in operating costs 
across the business. 
The Group promotes and 
shares best practice in the build 
process across all divisions and, 
to date, significant cost savings 
have been identified through 
this work. Cost savings have 
also been identified by agreeing 
changes to processes and 
introducing new technologies 
which improve our efficiency. 
The benefits of these savings 
will continue to be realised in 
the next few years.
Targeted land buying
Our aim is to optimise the value 
and cash generation from our 
existing land holdings, whilst 
bringing more recently acquired 
higher margin land into production 
as quickly as possible.
We have a disciplined and 
targeted land buying strategy that 
has clearly defined risk-related 
hurdle rates. During the year, we 
agreed terms on £578.1m of land 
purchases, totalling 12,085 plots. 
We have maintained our discipline 
of not chasing prices up and have 
continued to adopt an acquisition 
strategy that is not unduly 
concentrated on any specific 
geographic area. We have 
continued to see prices for land 
firming in the South East as other 
housebuilders target this area.
Total cash expenditure on 
land in the year was £397 .4m 
(2011: £261.0m).
We favour deferred terms, 
with the objective of matching 
our revenue and costs as closely 
as possible to maximise returns. 
Land creditors as at 30 June 2012 
were £726.1m (2011: £700.7m). 
Land creditors due within the 
next 12 months total £368.1m 
(2011: £349.1m), with £358.0m 
(2011: £351.6m) due thereafter, 
and in overall terms these equate

to 35% of our owned land bank. 
In the period to 30 June 2013, 
we expect land creditors to remain 
fairly constant as a proportion of 
the land bank, dependent upon 
the satisfaction of contractual 
conditions, for example, the  
grant of planning permission.
We are making good progress 
in moving our land bank from 
older to newer land, with impaired 
plots falling to 6,666 as at 30 June 
2012 (2011: 10,292), representing 
12% (2011: 17%) of the total 
owned and conditional land bank 
by plots. We expect impaired 
plots to reduce to around 4,500 
by 30 June 2013. During the year 
we sold parcels of impaired land, 
where it made economic sense  
to do so, incurring an operating 
loss. We will continue to review 
potential land sales on a limited 
number of sites where we 
consider that a sale would realise 
a greater net present value  
than development of the site.
In the year, more than a third 
of completions were from more 
recently acquired land and we 
continue to expect this proportion 
to increase to just above 50% 
in 2012/13 and around two-thirds 
in 2013/14. This newer land 
continues to perform in line with, 
or above, the minimum hurdle 
rates set on acquisition, namely 
a 20% gross margin and a 25% 
return on capital based on 
operating profit.
We have detailed planning 
consents for 96% of expected 
completions for 2012/13, and 
outline consent on a further 2%.
We have targeted a shorter 
land bank to improve capital 
efficiency and, as at 30 June 
2012, the Group’s owned land 
bank totalled 43,897 plots (2011: 
47 ,917) with an additional 10,312 
plots (2011: 12,166 plots) under 
conditional contracts, giving 
a total of 54,209 plots (2011: 
60,083 plots). This equates to 
approximately 4.3 years (2011: 
4.8 years) of owned and controlled 
land based on 2011/12 completion 
volumes. Over the next couple 
of years, we expect to maintain 
our owned and unconditional 
land bank, when seen relative 
to prior year completion volumes, 
at around three-and-a-half years’ 
supply, and the conditional land 
bank at around one year’s supply. 
The land bank owned by Group 
joint ventures is 1,120 plots (2011: 
1,625 plots).
In addition, we have c. 10,500 
(2011: c. 11,400) acres of strategic 
land which are regularly 
reassessed until the necessary 
planning consents are obtained. 
This land is carried at the lower 
of cost and net realisable value, 
minimising our exposure to risk. 
In the year 701 plots were 
transferred from strategic land to 
our operational land bank. Strategic 
land is expected to produce 
an increasing proportion of our 
operational land in future years.
Reducing overall 
indebtedness
Our second key objective is 
reducing overall indebtedness.
At 30 June 2012 net debt 
had fallen to £167 .7m, down from 
£322.6m at the same point in the 
previous year. The better than 
expected performance on 
reducing net debt was the result 
of a number of factors, including 
strong control of working capital, 
higher completion numbers, timing 
of land acquisitions, a lower 
investment per site and realising 
cash from other assets. 
We were able to take 
advantage of stronger market 
conditions during the second half 
of the year to increase sales on 
impaired sites which generated 
additional cash. We also sold 
three sites acquired before 2008, 
which had subsequently been 
impaired, for total cash proceeds 
of £15.2m and a net operating 
loss charged to normal trading of 
£4.6m. We will continue to target 
additional sales to generate cash 
from impaired sites where we 
consider such a sale will realise  
a greater net present value than 
the development of it.
One of the key factors driving 
down debt has been the focus on 
smaller sites of, on average, 110 
plots predominantly for houses 
rather than flats. The new sites 
have greater potential for 
standardised product and lower 
infrastructure expenditure, which 
result in a significantly lower 
average investment per site.
Sizing our business and 
target funding structure
We have reviewed the size and 
structure of our business taking 
account of current market 
conditions, including mortgage 
availability. We are confident that 
our current operational structure 
is ‘fit for purpose’ and that it is 
realistic, over time, to move to 
around 450 active sites (2012: 
average of 387 sites), which 
would result in around 15,000 
completions including those 
from our joint ventures (‘ JVs’) 
(2012: 12,857).
In light of these plans for the 
business and our ongoing focus 
to reduce overall indebtedness, 
it is our intention that by 2015 
we will achieve a target funding 
structure with no net debt at 
the financial year end date. 
Accordingly, our shareholders 
and land vendors (in the form of 
land creditors) will fund our land 
bank and long-term work in 
progress whereas our lending 
syndicate will fund our annual 
working capital requirements.
Government policy
The Government sees the 
acceleration of housebuilding as 
an important economic objective. 
The Government’s housing 
strategy, published in autumn 
2011, contained a number 
of initiatives, including proposals 
to improve the availability of 
mortgage finance via a mortgage 
indemnity scheme, to reform the 
planning regime and to release 
further public sector land. 
The NewBuy mortgage 
indemnity scheme was 
subsequently introduced in 
March 2012 and has the potential 
to significantly improve the loan 
to value offered in the new build

Emerson housetype – a 5 bedroom detached

 In the year, more than

were from more recently

continue to expect this 
proportion to increase 
to just above 50% in 
2012/13...  1

REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS
GROUP OVERVIEW • GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Although planning reform 
was introduced via the National 
Planning Policy Framework, it is 
unlikely that this will have a material 
short-term effect on the Group. 
We continue to move to a more 
‘localist’ approach in the way in 
which we seek to secure planning, 
with new procedures for earlier 
and fuller consultation with local 
residents. In the year, our scheme 
at Pickering Park in Yorkshire was 
the winner of the National 
Housebuilder Best Community 
Initiative Award.
The release of public land 
remains an important part of the 
Government’s strategy to increase 
housing supply. This land is 
particularly attractive where it is 
brought to the market with the 
potential for ‘build now pay later’ 
terms. Since 2009 we have 
secured more than 9,000 plots 
across 33 sites with a gross 
development value (‘GDV’) of £1.7 
billion either using the Developer 
Panel approach or via the OJEU.
In September 2012 the 
Government announced 
further measures to stimulate 
housebuilding, including additional 
FirstBuy funding, initiatives 
targeting the private rental market, 
reforms to planning and a 
reduction in the public funding 
requirement on mothballed 
developments.
The mortgage market
The availability and affordability 
of mortgages is a key catalyst for 
underlying housing demand. The 
level of mortgage approvals has 
reduced dramatically from the 
peak seen in 2007 , however 
we have seen a stabilisation 
of mortgage lending over the 
past couple of years. 
The mortgage market for new 
build housing continues to be 
dominated by a limited number 
of lenders. There have been some 
changes in their respective market 
shares during the year, primarily 
driven by the return of building 
societies and the changes in 
lending criteria from certain 
mortgage providers. Some 
lenders still provide a lower 
LTV on new build houses when 
compared with second-hand 
properties – there was typically 
a LTV of 90% on second-hand 
houses and 85% on new build 
houses. However, the majority 
of mortgage providers are now 
moving to a position of equality 
between the second-hand and 
new build markets. For example, 
Lloyds/Halifax increased their 
LTV to 90% on certain new build 
houses in early 2012 and such 
moves should continue to have 
a positive impact on mortgage 
availability for our customers.
The Government continues 
to stimulate the lending market 
sector. However, whilst initial 
customer interest has been 
promising, we will not be able to 
assess the scheme’s full potential 
until the autumn selling season. 
The mortgage interest rates 
associated with the product 
will also be an important factor 
in determining its impact.
During the year, FirstBuy, the 
Government-backed shared equity 
scheme, was an important tool and 
we completed 1,573 sales under 
the scheme. Our success in utilising 
the product meant that our initial 
allocation of £24.9m was increased 
by £13.8m during the year.
Shared equity remained 
an important selling tool given 
the continuing constraints on 
mortgage finance availability. 
During the year, 20.5% (2011: 
22.0%) of total completions were 
supported by shared equity and, 
of this, around two-thirds used 
Government-backed schemes.  BARRATT DEVELOPMENTS PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2012 15
and has launched the indemnity 
scheme NewBuy, which has 
underpinned the return of 95% 
mortgages in the new build 
sector. This is likely to be an 
important support for the 
mortgage market at higher levels 
of LTV, and provides the sector 
with an important advantage 
against the much larger, 
second-hand market.
Partnership and joint 
venture opportunities
During the year we have made 
progress in securing land through 
partnerships and JVs.
Barratt Partnerships, our 
specialist partnership team, working 
with our divisions, secured 1,676 
units on five sites during the year 
through public sector partnerships 
with a GDV of c. £425m. 
We have continued to bid for 
sites through the three area-based 
Development Partner Panels 
(‘DPPs’) that were established 
in 2010 by the Homes and 
Communities Agency. In the year 
we have been successful on three 
bids, and we are actively involved 
in six ongoing bids. 
We believe the Government’s 
intention to increase the release 
of public land to build up to 
100,000 new homes is a positive 
step. We have a proven track 
record of working with public 
sector partners and we are 
well positioned to capitalise 
on this initiative. 
We continue to explore JV 
opportunities which allow us either 
to access projects that may not 
otherwise be available, or to reduce 
the investment required and 
improve the return on capital 
employed through construction 
management or marketing fees.
In prior years, we established 
a portfolio of JVs in London and 
the South East. Our JV partners 
include London & Quadrant 
(‘L&Q’), one of the country’s 
largest Housing Associations, 
and the Wates Group, one 
of the UK’s largest building 
and construction companies.
We have added to this 
portfolio with two more JVs:
•	In March 2012, we signed a 
conditional contract to purchase 
a two-acre edge of the City site 
at Aldgate Place, London. The 
purchase of the site, which is 
being acquired in a 50:50 JV 
between the Group and British 
Land, is conditional on securing 
a revised planning consent for  
a residential-led mixed-use 
development.
•	In July 2012, in partnership 
with L&Q, we acquired an 
8.5 acre site at Fulham Wharf, 
London. The site, which is on 
the north bank of the Thames, 
has a GDV of £420m with 
planning permission for 
463 riverside apartments 
and a new supermarket.
In the year, our JVs delivered 
220 (2011: 93) completions and 
we anticipate that completions 
will increase further as our new 
JVs commence.
Commercial developments
Commercial development revenue 
was £36.6m (2011: £49.2m). 
This included revenue from the 
design and build of a foodstore 
in Warrington. The project was 
completed in April 2012. 
Operating profit from the 
commercial development 
business during the year 
was £1.5m (2011: £0.8m).
We were also successful 
during the year in completing an 
agreement for the redevelopment 
of part of Wokingham town 
centre. The redevelopment will 
be delivered in partnership with 
our housebuilding operations 
and is one of a number of 
schemes where our commercial 
and housebuild businesses are 
working together to deliver 
enhanced returns for the Group.
Quality, service and design 
In 2010 and 201 1 we updated 
both the Barratt and David Wilson 
Homes house ranges with internal 
layouts designed around modern 
living. The new designs continue 
to be well received by consumers 
and we continue to roll out both 
new ranges. Our commitment 
to delivering the highest quality 
product and excellent customer 
service has been confirmed by our 
customers both through our internal 
survey where 98% (201 1: 98%) of 
customers would ‘Recommend 
us to a Friend’ and our achievement 
of HBF 5-Star status for a third 
successive year. Our high quality 
housing products have assisted 
our ongoing drive to improve 
profitability, through achieving 
optimum selling prices and 
improving operational efficiency.
Health, safety and the 
environment
The safety of our employees, 
contractors, customers and the 
wider community is fundamental 
to the way in which we operate. 
During the period, our Injury 
Incidence Rate (‘IIR’) was 511 
(2011: 539) per 100,000 persons 
employed, which is a 5% 
decrease year-on-year. We remain 
committed to enhancing health 
and safety and have an Executive 
Health and Safety Committee, 
which reports to the Board, 
to drive further improvement.
We aim to secure a position 
as the lowest cost provider 
complying with the Code for 
Sustainable Homes (the ‘Code’). 
During the year we built 3,820 
homes to Code Level 3 or above, 
of which 868 complied with Code 
Level 4. We are establishing 
improved and lower cost methods 
which allow us to continue to 
reduce the cost of compliance. 
We are also progressing our 
development at Hanham Hall, 
the UK’s first large-scale zero 
carbon housing development. 
We have completed the external 
renovation of the original listed 
Hanham Hall building and we 
are now well advanced with 
the full development of the site.
Outlook
The Group has made significant 
progress in both rebuilding 
profitability and reducing 
indebtedness during the year 
just ended. Despite continued 
uncertainty surrounding the 
outlook for the wider UK market 
and constrained levels of mortgage 
finance, the industry has enjoyed 
a period of relative stability.
Since 1 July 2012, our sales 
performance has been in-line 
with normal seasonal trends. In 
the last nine weeks, net private 
reservations per active site per 
week have averaged 0.50 (201 1: 
0.50) and our private forward order 
book (excluding JVs) currently 
stands at £609.6m (201 1: £528.7m).
Our strategy is capable of 
delivering significantly enhanced 
returns without any improvement 
in market conditions, and in the 
current financial year we expect to 
make further good progress, with 
over half of completions forecast to 
be delivered from our more recently 
acquired higher margin land.

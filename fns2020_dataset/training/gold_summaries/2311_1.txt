Our plan to ‘Focus, Drive and Broaden’ 
Booker is on track. 
FOCUS  
(commenced November 2005)
Booker seeks to become the most 
efﬁcient operator in our sector. Bryn 
satherley and his team continue to improve 
business efﬁciency. We ‘stop, simplify and 
standardise’ work and invest most of the 
savings in customer service. through tight 
cash management we have now increased 
net cash from £27.1m last year to £63.4m 
this year.
DRIVE  
(commenced March 2006)
Booker Wholesale, our cash and carry 
business, served 465,000 customers 
this year up from 444,000 last year. guy 
Farrant and the team continue to ‘Drive’ 
choice, price and service. Each year we 
survey 40,000 customers to identify where 
improvements can be made. Customer 
satisfaction improved again this year and 
our customer count has increased again, 
up by 21,000 customers.
Choice Up
•	 in 2007 we launched Euro shopper as 
an entry price brand for independent 
retailers. it now has retail sales of 
£134m. the range has 60 products 
and retailers achieve a minimum of 30% 
margin. Our Euro shopper soft drinks 
are doing particularly well. 
•	 in 2010 we launched Farm Fresh. sales 
in the year were £45m. the quality and 
freshness of the produce is second to none 
and can be delivered to our customers 
within 48 hours of being harvested.
•	 Chef’ s larder is our own label brand for 
caterers. sales were £183m, up 15% 
on the prior year. Progress has been 
made across the range, for example 
we reinvigorated Chef’ s larder Cheese. 
Our speciality cheese is now sourced 
from award winning creameries. the 
flavours, texture and packaging have 
been improved.
Prices Down
•	 Ours is a very price competitive market. 
Every week we monitor prices versus 
competitors. During the year our price 
index remained competitive. Customer 
satisfaction for our pricing has made 
good progress. 
Better Service
•	 stock availability further improved to be 
the best we have achieved in six years.
•	 Our people are doing a brilliant job. 
Our customers rate Booker people 
highly. Business Centre teams have 
been trained in PriDE to help improve 
the Parking, reception, inside, Delivery 
and Exit experience.
Catering
•	 Catering sales grew by 6.1% to £1.2bn, 
because our choice, price and service 
continued to improve. Our catering 
development sales force continues to 
serve our existing customers and to 
introduce new customers to Booker. 
During the year the catering customer 
count increased by 14,000. 
Premier
•	 Premier, Booker’s symbol group, grew 
by 11%. the estate grew to 2,702

BROADEN  
(commenced April 2007)
in the UK, Booker seeks to offer the 
best choice, price and service to 
caterers and retailers and to become 
the suppliers’ preferred route to market. 
We also want to sell new products and 
services and reach new customers. 
in india we seek to become the best 
supplier to Kirana stores. to achieve 
these objectives, we are ‘Broadening’ 
the business. ‘Broaden’ includes:
Improving the cash and carry 
business centre experience
•	 We have now converted 142 of our 
172 business centres to the ‘Extra’ 
format. this features a lighter, brighter 
business centre environment and an 
improved choice, price and service. 
the conversion pays back in around 
a year and we plan to convert a further 
20 business centres to ‘Extra’ in the 
year ahead. if you visit Brighton you 
will see one of our latest ‘Extras’. it 
has an outstanding fresh foods offer, 
ritter speciality foods section and a 
Classic on trade section. the lessons 
from Brighton will be rolled to the rest 
of the business over the next ﬁve years.
Harnessing the Internet
•	 sales of booker.co.uk were £635m, 
up from £526m last year and £15m 
in 2005. all these sales are delivered 
to our customers’ premises. We 
have 170,000 customers registered 
on the website compared to 102,000 
last year. Customers can view their 
account details, use an iPhone app 
and order products. 
Booker Direct/Ritter-Courivaud/
Classic/Chef Direct
•	 Mark aylwin and his team are building 
our delivered wholesale business. 
Booker Direct has great customers 
including the prison service in England 
and Wales, Marks & s pencer and most 
of the cinema chains.
•	 in 2010 we acquired Classic, an 
on-trade wholesaler supplying pubs 
and licensed customers mainly in the 
North West. We are taking some of the 
Classic range into Booker and have 
saved rental costs by moving some of 
the Classic range into a neighbouring 
Booker business centre. in July we 
launched Classic in Brighton and it has 
become the second largest on-trade 
wholesaler in that market. We will be 
rolling Classic out to a further 5 sites 
in the year ahead.
•	 in 2010 we acquired ritter-Courivaud, 
a leading speciality food supplier to 
restaurants. through combining the 
logistics expertise we have in Booker 
Direct, with the catering knowledge 
from ritter and the groups’ buying 
scale, we are now launching Chef 
Direct. Chef Direct will be based in 
Didcot and will become “the new force 
in foodservice”.
•	 in the last year Booker group delivered 
£1.1bn of product to retailers and 
caterers in the UK. With the inclusion 
of ritter-Courivaud we can become 
a major force in foodservice and with 
Classic we can become a signiﬁcant 
player in on-trade.

Booker India 
•	 in september 2009 we opened our 
ﬁrst business centre in Mumbai. We 
now have 10,000 customers and the 
customer reaction has been excellent. 
We have also launched 118 Happy 
shopper symbol retailers which harness 
the lessons from Premier in the UK 
for the Kirana stores of Mumbai. in 
2011 we opened our ﬁrst joint venture 
business centre in Pune. Our partner 
in Pune is satnam arora, who has 
expertise which complements our own. 
in 2012 we opened our second branch 
in Mumbai which is performing well. We 
look forward to developing the Booker 
offer in other cities to become the best 
choice, price and service supplier to 
Kirana stores and caterers. 
Sustainability
•	 Booker was the ﬁrst UK food wholesaler 
to be awarded the Carbon trust 
standard and remains the only whole-
saler to achieve recertiﬁcation. Our 
absolute carbon foot print reduced by 
4% over the three year period despite 
growing sales by 21%. this helped 
us achieve 71st place out of 2,100 
companies in the government’s ﬁrst 
CrC league table.
•	 We have recycled 5.4m litres of used 
cooking oil from our catering customers. 
•	 We have sent 15% less to landﬁll, 
in spite of increasing sales by 7%. 
recycling has increased by 18% and 
we now have 65 branches who send 
food waste to anaerobic Digestion
•	 We have customer packaging recycling 
centres in all business centres and are 
helping our customers save money, 
increase recycling and support more 
sustainable communities throughout 
the UK. 
People
•	 the progress at Booker has been 
achieved by our great team of people. 
We are committed to continuing to 
make Booker better and safer for 
colleagues. We are also developing 
talent. For example, there is a shortage 
of butchers in the trade, so we have 
partnered with the University of West 
london to develop a formal “butchery 
apprenticeship”. 31 new butchers 
graduated this year and 50 signed up 
for the next scheme. We developed a 
similar scheme for greengrocers with 33 
colleagues graduating this year and 50 
signing up for the coming year.
•	 For the sixth year running, the 
performance of the business means 
our people have shared in our 
success through our bonus system. 
With this great team of people Booker 
will continue to make progress in the 
year ahead. 
Our plan to Focus, Drive and Broaden the 
business is on track. Customer satisfaction 
improved further, we served 22,000 more 
customers and grew sales by over £260m. 
internet sales grew 21% to £635m. 
Booker Direct is trading well and we are 
in the process of launching Chef Direct. 
We are pleased with the performance of 
Booker india. We remain committed to 
helping our 481,000 customers prosper 
in the year ahead.

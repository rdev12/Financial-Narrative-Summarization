 4	 Cobham 	 plc	 Annual 	 Report	 and	 Accounts	 2007
Chairman’s	 statement
I	 am	 very	 pleased	 to	 report,	 in	 this	 my	 last	 statement,	 	 an	 excellent	 set	 of	 results	 for	 the	 Group	 in	 2007.	 It	 was	 another	 year	 of	 robust	 order	 intake	 finishing	 with	 a	 record	 order	 book	 of	 £1.8bn.	 	 Total	 Group	 revenue	 increased	 by	 	 4.5%	 to	 £1,061.1m	 (2006:	 £1,015.7m).	 Trading	 profit	 rose	 by	 6.7%	 to	 £198.8m	 (2006:	 £186.3m)	 and	 underlying	 profit	 before	 tax	 rose	 by	 12.9%	 to	 £206.5m	 (2006:	 £182.9m).
Underlying	 earnings	 per	 share	 of	 13.09p	 (2006:	 11.66p)	 were	 12.3%	 higher	 than	 	 the	 previous	 year	 and	 your	 Directors	 have	 recommended	 a	 final	 dividend	 of	 3.28p	 per	 share	 (2006:	 2.64p).	 Together	 with	 the	 interim	 dividend	 of	 1.22p	 per	 share	 (2006:	 1.11p)	 which	 was	 paid	 in	 December	 2007	 this	 represents	 an	 increase	 of	 20%	 compared	 to	 2006.	 Subject	 to	 shareholders’	 approval,	 the	 final	 dividend	 will	 be	 paid	 on	 1	 July	 2008	 to	 all	 shareholders	 on	 the	 register	 at	 30	 May	 2008.
Corporate development
The	 Group’s	 strategy	 continues	 to	 	 be	 based	 on	 growth	 in	 chosen	 high	 technology	 markets,	 primarily	 aerospace,	 defence	 and	 homeland	 security.
In	 2007	 and	 early	 2008	 the	 Group	 announced	 five	 acquisitions	 for	 a	 total	 	 of	 approximately	 US$750m.	 These	 are	 	 all	 located	 in	 the	 USA	 and	 details	 are	 set	 out	 on	 pages	 18	 and	 19	 of	 this	 report.
The	 Group	 has	 also	 announced	 a	 	 new	 and	 simplified	 organisational	 structure	 which	 will	 enhance	 business	 performance,	 leverage	 divisional	 capabilities	 and	 accelerate	 research	 	 and	 development	 activities.	 This	 	 report	 reflects	 the	 new	 organisation.
In	 February	 2008	 the	 United	 States	 Air	 Force	 selected	 the	 KC-45A	 for	 its	 tanker	 replacement	 programme,	 which	 will	 be	 fitted	 with	 Cobham’s	 all	 digital	 hose	 and	 drogue	 refuelling	 pods	 for	 under	 wing	 and	 fuselage	 refuelling.	 This	 selection	 confirms	 Cobham’s	 leading	 position	 in	 the	 air	 refuelling	 market	 and	 is	 expected	 to	 provide	 a	 significant	 workload	 for	 many	 years.
People
Jeff	 Edington	 retired	 in	 June	 after	 11	 years	 on	 the	 Board.	 We	 thank	 him	 for	 his	 advice	 and	 support	 which	 has	 been	 extremely	 valuable	 throughout	 his	 time	 with	 the	 Group.	 In	 December	 David	 Turner	 was	 appointed	 a	 Director	 and	 Deputy	 Chairman.	 	 David	 brings	 a	 wealth	 of	 international	 business	 experience	 from	 his	 previous	 appointments	 with	 GKN	 and	 Brambles.	 He	 will	 take	 over	 from	 me	 as	 Chairman	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 2008	 AGM	 and	 I	 will	 retire	 from	 the	 Board	 at	 the	 end	 of	 my	 current	 appointment	 in	 November	 2008.
Alex	 Hannam	 retired	 at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 year	 after	 four	 years	 on	 the	 Board.	 We	 thank	 him	 for	 his	 major	 contribution	 during	 this	 period.	 He	 will	 continue	 to	 provide	 advice	 to	 the	 Group	 on	 special	 projects	 in	 the	 first	 half	 of	 2008.
Many	 congratulations	 to	 Chief	 Executive	 Allan	 Cook	 who	 was	 awarded	 the	 CBE	 in	 the	 Queen’s	 New	 Year	 Honours	 List.
Outlook
The	 Group	 is	 increasingly	 embedded	 	 in	 high	 technology	 programmes	 of	 national	 significance	 in	 many	 countries.	 Notwithstanding	 the	 generally	 uncertain	 economic	 climate,	 external	 and	 internal	 security	 of	 nations	 remains	 of	 paramount	 importance.	 This	 provides	 a	 base	 for	 long-term	 sustained	 growth.
I	 am	 delighted	 to	 see	 progress	 in	 	 our	 career	 development	 and	 talent	 management	 programmes.	 Our	 ability	 	 to	 recruit,	 retain	 and	 develop	 the	 skills	 we	 need	 is	 an	 important	 feature	 of	 our	 continued	 success.
On	 behalf	 of	 the	 Board	 I	 thank	 all	 of	 our	 employees	 for	 another	 year	 of	 significant	 achievement	 and	 look	 forward	 to	 further	 progress	 in	 2008.

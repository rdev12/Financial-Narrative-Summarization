 Based near Rotherham, South Yorkshire and incorporated in the United Kingdom, Inditherm plc
designs, manufactures and installs heating solutions using the Company’s innovative, patented,
low voltage, carbon-based conductive polymer technology (CPT). This provides a flexible heating
material that can be fitted over a wide variety of shapes, as well as laid out flat to heat large areas
from above or below. Running from a low voltage (6V to 50V) DC or AC power supply, it can
reach temperatures of up to 120°C.
Applications for the technology are numerous but the Company is focusing on selected
applications and market areas where there are perceived to be significant growth opportunities.
Inditherm already has an established track record in industrial process industries, such as
confectionery, food and chemicals, where CPT is ideal for heating pipes, tanks, valves and pumps
and medical (patient warming). In addition, the Company is focused on producing heating
solutions for utility water and waste water treatment plants, concrete curing and sports pitch
heating.

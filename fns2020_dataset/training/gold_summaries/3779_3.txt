Communisis plc  Annual Report and Financial Statements 2012
Chairman’s Statement
Results
Communisis has grown the business in 2012 and substantially 
improved proﬁt from operations and operating margin before 
exceptional items for the third consecutive year . 
The Group has secured a number of new and signiﬁcant  
multi-year contractual relationships in recent months that will 
help to underpin results for 2013 and beyond. Its commitment 
to market-leading technology is driving efficiencies and 
product innovation and the beneﬁts to clients have been 
inﬂuential in a number of these contract wins. Importantly 
they provide further evidence that Communisis is the trusted 
partner of many leading, consumer-facing brands in delivering 
their personalised customer communications. 
Proﬁt from operations before exceptional items grew to 
£11.6m, a 23% increase on 2011. This represented an operating 
margin of 6.5% on sales (excluding pass through) compared 
to 5.5% in 2011. The exceptional items, which were lower in 
2012 at £2.8m (2011 £4.3m), related principally to a further 
restructuring programme and to non-recurring costs associated 
with acquisition activities. Proﬁt after tax increased by 27% 
from £4.1m to £5.2m and basic earnings per share by the same 
percentage from 2.96p to 3.75p. Adjusted earnings per share, 
which exclude the after-tax effect of exceptional items and the 
amortisation of acquired intangibles, increased by 19% from 
4.68p to 5.56p.
The proposed ﬁnal dividend of 1.1p per share brings the total 
dividend for the year to 1.65p per share, an increase of 10%  
over 2011, reﬂecting both the strong operating performance in 
2012 and the Board’s conﬁdence in the future of the business.  
The dividend will be payable on 20 May 2013 to shareholders  
on the register at 19 April 2013.
Growth capital 
The Group raised growth capital for the ﬁrst time in early  
2013 with gross proceeds of £20m. The net proceeds (after 
transaction costs) will be used for investment in new contracts, 
for restructuring costs and for small acquisitions and working 
capital. They will strengthen the Balance Sheet and fund 
the next phase of proﬁtable growth. The share issue was 
substantially oversubscribed with strong demand from both 
existing shareholders and new investors demonstrating their 
conﬁdence in the Group’s strategy and growth opportunities.
Board changes 
Jane Griffiths joined the Board as a non-executive director  
on 17 May 2012. Jane is Marketing Director EMEA for Citibank NA 
having previously worked as a senior advertising and marketing 
executive for a number of major global agencies.
John Wells will be moving to a part-time role from 9 May 2013 
and has decided to step down from the Board after the 2013 
Annual General Meeting. John will therefore not be seeking  
re-appointment at the Annual General Meeting on 9 May 2013.   
The Board would like to thank John for his signiﬁcant 
contribution to the Group in various management roles  
within companies that originally comprised the Group  
since 1972 and to the Board since 2009 and welcome  
his ongoing involvement.
Outlook
Notwithstanding the current macro-economic environment 
in the UK, Communisis has started 2013 with a number of 
important contract wins. The new contracts will contribute 
from the ﬁrst half and highlight the attractiveness of the 
Group’s competitive proposition, especially in transactional 
communications and increasingly in overseas markets. With 
much of what we do being of operational necessity for our 
clients and with a stronger balance sheet and the resources  
to develop the business further , the Board is conﬁdent that  
the Group can deliver another year of growth.

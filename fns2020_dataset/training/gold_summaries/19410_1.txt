 04 Quintain Estates & Development plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Chief Executive’s Statement
The financial year was characterised by 
the unfolding global recession, despite 
the efforts of governments to protect 
their national economies. As a result, 
the property sector continued to 
experience great challenges and, 
although the prime market recovered  
at the end of 2009 in response to a wave 
of cash from overseas investors and 
retail funds entering the market, this 
contrasted strongly with the weakness 
of tenant demand.
Results
Our results reflect the wider property 
environment during the year and our 
portfolio’s weight of development 
assets, which typically recover at later 
points in the cycle. Whilst prime property 
was re-rated in the second half of the 
year, ongoing economic uncertainty 
dampened lenders’ appetite for 
development risk and therefore, as 
anticipated, the value of our major 
schemes remained largely static.  
The resulting net asset value per  
share at 31 March 2010 was 120p.  
This compares with 121p, adjusted  
for the rights issue, at the end of  
the last financial year and created  
a total return of (0.8)%. 
Throughout the period we have 
progressively reinforced the business: 
the cash repatriation target was 
surpassed ahead of schedule, overheads 
were reduced by a further 12.4% to 
£21.1m building on the 13.8% reduction 
achieved in the previous financial year, 
and the Company undertook a 
transformational rights issue.  
The combined result of these activities 
was to reduce debt materially, adding 
considerable strength to our balance 
sheet and building a secure platform 
from which to focus on delivering value. 
Gearing, as per our banking definition, 
was 46% at the year end (2009: 105%) 
against a covenant of 110% and interest 
cover was 2.8 times (2009: 1.7 times) 
against a 1.25 times covenant.  
The rights issue has also equipped  
the Group with its share of the equity 
funding it requires to deliver all key 
objectives within the three year 
business plan.
 The performance in income 
terms reflects the actions taken to 
create this stability, with gross profit 
before impairment falling 2.9% to 
£34.0m, partly as a result of sales of 
investment assets. These sales gave 
rise to a loss on valuation, directly  
and through joint ventures, of £9.8m, 
contributing to the loss before tax of 
£10.1m. However, operating profits 
excluding impairments and exceptional 
items rose 18.3% to £12.9m (2009: 
£10.9m) demonstrating an increasingly 
efficient underlying business.
“ The rights issue has 
equipped the Group 
with its share of the 
equity funding it 
requires to deliver  
all key objectives 
within the three  
year business plan.”

Operational and Financial Review Governance Financial Statements Corporate Information Overview
Business delivery
Good operational progress was 
achieved during the period. Our largest 
Fund, Quercus, completed the year 
with the successful raising from 
existing investors of £82.7m at a  
5% premium to net asset value.  
The number of income-generating beds 
in our student accommodation fund 
doubled during the reporting period, 
substantially increasing the Group’s 
share of rental income; and construction 
work on the Bristol and Bath Science 
Park, which is being developed and 
operated by our Quantum Fund, began 
shortly after the year end. The first 
phase of construction of this BREEAM 
Excellent park will be complete and 
income-generating next summer.
Maintaining momentum on our 
Urban Regeneration schemes has 
remained a priority. We were pleased  
to finish the year with 308,000 sq ft of 
new commercial space at Greenwich, 
70% of which has already been let,  
and 520 homes completed at Wembley, 
82% of which are now sold or in 
lawyers’ hands. We have continued  
to attract high quality, international 
brands to our schemes, including  
Hilton International, Tesco, Cineworld 
and Barclaycard.
People
We announce today that, after nine 
years’ service to the Board, Senior 
Independent Director David 
Pangbourne will retire at the Annual 
General Meeting in September 2010. 
David has made an invaluable 
contribution to Quintain over the last 
decade, not least in his eight years  
as Chairman of the Audit Committee, 
and will be greatly missed. 
As previously announced, in 
October William Rucker took over as 
Chairman from John Plender, who 
stepped down from the Board at the 
end of the financial year. In January, 
Joan MacNaughton retired and  
Charles Cayzer and Sir Peter Dixon 
joined the Board. Subsequent to the 
year end, Tonianne Dwyer resigned  
as executive director and Head of Fund 
Management and was replaced in May 
by David Gavaghan.
Outlook
The operational targets within our three 
year business plan are to grow funds 
under management to £2bn and 
complete the Western Core of Wembley 
City. Both actions will increase 
materially the amount of recurring 
income received by the Group. Within 
this three year business plan, there are 
clear operational targets for the next  
12 months shown in the adjacent box 
and against which we will report 
progress.
Although the UK may well be 
facing a period of slow economic 
growth, or even decline, this need not 
impede achieving our primary target of 
a recurring cashflow-positive state or 
impact materially the value we intend 
to capture from our regeneration 
schemes. Through careful financial 
management and prudent 
implementation of our strategy, we 
remain focused on the delivery for 
shareholders of strong and sustained 
returns.

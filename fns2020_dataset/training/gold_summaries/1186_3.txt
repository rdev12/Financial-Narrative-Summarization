Annual Report and Accounts 2009 Business Review
Highlights
A contract signed for the provision of media
rights content to SIS with an estimated total value
of £106m over its five-year term from 2012. £32m
of advanced payments to be received upfront.
Revenues increased to £65.2m (2008: £64.8m)
and profit before tax up by 3% to £4.1m 
(2008: £4.0m).
Shepway Council has included Folkestone
Racecourse in its Local Development Framework
consultation document as the potential site 
of a high-quality mixed-use development of 
at least 400 homes.
Lingfield Park hotel and leisure project is 
on target to be fully operational by May 2010.
In 2009, Arena clearly demonstrated its ability to deliver
significant long-term value, most notably through its
transformational deal over future media rights with Satellite
Information Services Ltd (‘SIS’), announced in July. Arena has
continued to trade well through difficult market conditions
and is reporting earnings ahead of those achieved last year .
In addition, good progress was made on the Group’s strategy
for asset value creation.
Revenue in the year to 31 December 2009 increased to
£65.2m (2008: £64.8m) principally as a result of increased
income from Levy prize money contributions, and through
contractual increases in media rights income from BAGS.
The additional revenues from industry sources compensated
for a shortfall in revenues from our consumer business,
most notably in corporate and private hospitality. 
Profit before tax increased by 3% to £4.1m (2008: £4.0m).
Included within this is a gain on disposal of non-core land
assets of £0.4m (2008: £1.7m) and finance costs £2.2m lower
at £1.2m (2008: £3.4m). In 2008, the significant reduction in
market interest rates resulted in a £1.5m non-cash charge
on the movement in valuation of our interest rate hedge
instruments (2009: £nil). Lower prevailing interest rates and
the reduction in the Group’s net borrowings (following receipt
of the £12.5m advanced payment from the media rights deal
with SIS in July 2009) also had a positive impact on finance
costs. Basic earnings per share were 3% higher at 1.16p
(2008: 1.12p). 
During 2009, Arena staged 370 fixtures (2008: 363), again
representing 26% of all UK racing fixtures (2008: 26%). 
Total attendance at our seven racecourses increased by 
2% to 639,000 (2008: 629,000) and we maintained average
attendance per fixture at 1,727 (2008: 1,733). The UK 
racing industry as a whole attracted over 5.7 million 
(2008: 5.7 million) visitors on course during the year 
and average industry attendance was also maintained 
at 4,008 (2008: 4,017).

Transforming the Business
In 2009, Arena clearly demonstrated its ability to deliver significant 
long-term value, most notably through its transformational deal over
future media rights with SIS. It has continued to trade well through
difficult market conditions and to make good progress on its strategy 
for asset value creation.

Annual Report and Accounts 2009
In July, we announced the signing of an agreement with SIS
for the provision of horseracing content into licensed betting
offices (‘LBOs’) in the UK and Ireland for a five-year period
from 1 January 2012. Over this period, we estimate that the
total revenues receivable by Arena will be £106m, nearly
double the value of our current contract with BAGS for which
revenues are estimated at £55m. Arena will receive a total 
of £32m of this revenue in advance of the contract start date,
with £12.5m already having been received. With a substantial
uplift in profitability resulting from 2012, this transformational
agreement will further reduce net borrowings and enhance
future operating cash flows.
Arena has continued to progress its real estate development
opportunities in line with its stated strategy. The Lingfield
Park Marriott hotel and country club construction is now
nearing completion and this significant development will 
be fully operational, as planned, by May 2010, completing a
£30m development. In addition, following our representations,
Shepway Council is recommending a high-quality mixed-use
development at Folkestone Racecourse to include at least
400 homes as part of the redevelopment of the Racecourse
which will help secure its future. 
At The Races (‘ATR’), in which Arena owns a 45.85% stake,
has built on the improved performance of 2008 with Arena’s
share of ATR’s post-tax result for 2009 increasing by 66% 
to £0.5m (2008: £0.3m). Following the year end, in January
2010, ATR announced a joint venture with Racecourse 
Media Group (‘RMG’) for the pooling of the international
distribution of media rights of all racecourses in the UK 
and Ireland which further enhances ATR’s strong position 
for future growth.
The media rights agreement with SIS further strengthened
Arena’s financial position and we have agreed £55m of
renewed banking facilities, on good commercial terms, 
with our relationship bank, Lloyds Banking Group. We are
grateful for the Bank’s continued commitment to Arena. 
In light of the recent robust performance and the new 
media rights agreement, the Board is pleased to announce
that it is proposing to recommence dividend payments with 
a final dividend for 2009 of 0.38p per share (2008: nil). No
interim dividend was paid during the year (2008: 0.25p per
share) and it is the Board’s intention to pay future dividends
in one annual instalment as a final dividend. 
The Board recognises the significant contribution that all 
of Arena’s staff have made to the business during the year .
Whilst adverse economic conditions increased the operational
challenges, our people continue to deliver consistently high
standards of professionalism and quality of customer service
of which we are justly proud. 
The economic outlook remains uncertain. However, our
trading performance in the year to date has been robust and
is in line with the Board’s expectations. Whilst the industry
suffered multiple abandonments due to the prolonged 
cold weather in January and February, Arena’s all-weather
racecourses have meant that we were able to stage
additional fixtures at short notice during this period and 
our total programme for the year remains virtually intact.
We are excited about the imminent opening of the Lingfield
Park Marriott hotel and leisure project and look forward to
another year in which we continue to evolve Arena’s multiple
sources of value creation.

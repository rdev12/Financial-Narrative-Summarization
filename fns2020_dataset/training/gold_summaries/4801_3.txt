 3 Diploma PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2009
Chairman’s Statement
The Diploma Group demonstrated the resilience of its
business model in the face of the global recession which
impacted most markets and geographies from early in
the financial year. The Group drew strength from its
spread of sectors and geographies, as well as the focus
on providing consumable products and services to
specialised market sectors. Where revenues were
reduced, the Group’s businesses reacted quickly to scale
back operating costs and working capital and reduce
balance sheet exposure. 
Although underlying Group revenues and operating
profits were reduced, operating margins were held to 
a creditable 16% in the continuing businesses and 
free cash flow of £23.5m was generated in the year.
This enabled the Group to continue to invest selectively
in new growth initiatives which will bring rewards as
markets eventually recover. 
Results and Dividends
Shortly after the financial year end, contracts were
exchanged for the disposal of the Manual Liquid
Handling business of Anachem for cash proceeds up
to a maximum of £8.6m; the results of Anachem for
the year ended 30 September 2009 have been
classified as discontinuing.
In 2009, Group revenue from the continuing businesses
increased by 2% to £160.0m (2008: £156.2m).
Operating profit, before the amortisation of acquisition
intangible assets, decreased by 4% to £25.6m 
(2008: £26.6m) and operating margins reduced to 
16.0% (2008: 17.0%).
Adjusted profit before tax from the continuing
businesses decreased by 5% to £25.5m (2008: £26.8m)
and adjusted earnings per share declined 8% to 14.8p
(2008: 16.0p). Including the discontinuing business,
adjusted profit before tax was £26.7m (2008: £27.5m)
and adjusted earnings per share 15.6p (2008: 16.4p).
The strong cash flow performance is reflected in an
increase of 33% in free cash flow from the continuing
businesses to £23.5m (2008: £17.7m). Cash flow of
£1.7m was added by the discontinuing business and
£12.2m invested in the acquisition of businesses. At 30
September 2009, cash funds had increased by £5.6m to
£21.3m (2008: £15.7m). 
In recognition of the strong free cash flow and resilient
earnings performance, the Board proposes to increase
the final dividend by 6% to 5.3p (2008: 5.0p). The total
dividend for the year will increase by 4% to 7.8p 
(2008: 7.5p).
Management and Employees
The experience, knowledge and skills of our employees
continue to be a crucial element in the success of 
the Group. As the economic outlook has deteriorated
however, there has been a need to reduce the number
of people employed in several of the Group’s
businesses to match the requirements of their
contracting markets. I wish to thank all of our
employees for their understanding and hard work
throughout a challenging year.
Outlook
The Board anticipates that the 2010 financial year will
continue to be challenging and is not planning for early
recovery in trading activity. The Board remains confident
however in the resilience of the Group’s model and the
strength of its cash flow. The Group therefore is well
positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities
which should come with market recovery.

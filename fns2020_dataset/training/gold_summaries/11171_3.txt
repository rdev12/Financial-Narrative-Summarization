 I am pleased to report that the Company has, in a challenging year, delivered a profitable set of final results for the year ended
31 December 2010.
As we advised in our Trading Update of 10 December 2010, a number of challenges affected our financial performance this
year.  Some contracts with new clients were slower to emerge than first anticipated, mainly due to M&A activities amongst
telecom operators with which we had previously been in advanced discussions, in addition to associated regulatory issues
that caused delays to other potential projects. This coupled with unusual end of service costs of specific personnel and
aborted acquisition activities had the impact of reducing gross and net margins. We have worked diligently in spite of these
challenges this year to maintain a profitable performance as a business whilst, at the same, continued with our efforts to move
our strategic expansion plans forward. As a consequence, our position as an independent market leader in our core markets
has been maintained. We are also pleased to have further strengthened our Company’s operational cash flow conversion rates
during 2010.
Our efforts to further expand geographically, and into new end-markets, have continued in to the start of 2011 and will be our
focus throughout the year ahead. We are seeing some of the delayed projects advance and further opportunities with new
clients to support our 2011 expectations and longer term growth ambitions.
While Norcon has not in 2010 been able to achieve growth, we have demonstrated the inherent stability of our business in
core markets and that of our client relationships. 
We have a strong, flexible and highly capable team at Norcon and I would like to thank my Board colleagues and each of our
employees for their commitment, enthusiasm and efforts this year.

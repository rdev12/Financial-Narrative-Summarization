Introduction
On behalf of the Board it gives me great 
pleasure to report a further year of 
progression for the Group, with adjusted 
earnings up 19% to 39.1 pence per share 
(2013: 32.9 pence).
Matchtech Group was incorporated in 
1984 by George Materna, our founder and 
my predecessor as Chairman. On 1 August 
2014 we celebrated the Group’s 30th 
birthday and its remarkable achievements 
in that time.
I must thank George for his inspiration 
in creating Matchtech Group and for 
the legacy he bestowed to me when he 
stepped down from the Chairmanship.
Strategy, Purpose and Vision
I joined Matchtech Group because 
I believed it was a great company with lots 
of potential and everything I have seen 
since arriving here in December 2013 has 
confirmed that view. We have a strong 
client proposition, good people, a terrific 
culture and the Group is financially sound.
During this year we have refined and 
sharpened our strategy so that we can 
do even better in the future. We have 
conducted research both internally and 
externally to ensure that we completely 
understand how the Group is seen by our 
staff, clients and candidates.
This has enabled us to agree on our 
Purpose, whereby we aim to engage 
our staff, delight our clients and promote 
our candidates.
This in turn has enabled us to build our 
Vision to 2017 and beyond.
We have a solid foundation based around 
our high quality people. We know that 
ongoing growth depends on us continuing 
to value and engage our staff, so this year 
we used our engagement survey to find 
out what they think of the Group.
Our overall engagement score was an 
outstanding 90% placing us in the top 5% 
of our benchmark group.
The survey confirmed that culture is one 
of the most important factors driving our 
engagement score. Our staff told us it 
was our culture and values that attracted 
them to us and these are the biggest 
reasons they stay. This demonstrates the 
huge importance our culture plays in the 
Group’s success.
The Board
During the year we said goodbye to Andy 
White, who left the business having joined 
the Board in 1990.
His counsel, energy and commitment to 
our business will be missed. I thank him on 
behalf of the Board and our shareholders 
for all his input over the years.
Dividend
The Group’s progressive dividend 
policy remains an important part of 
our investment proposition and having 
maintained the dividend through the 
recession we are pleased to add to last 
year’s increase.
The Board recommends to shareholders 
a final dividend of 14.59 pence per share, 
an increase of 14% on last year.
This gives a total dividend for the year of 
20.0 pence per share (2013: 18.0 pence) 
up 11% with an adjusted dividend cover 
increasing to 2.0 times (2013: 1.8 times).
If approved by shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting, to be held on 14 November 
2014, the final dividend will be payable on 
5 December 2014 to those shareholders 
registered on 7 November 2014.
Outlook
With a clear purpose and vision, a refined 
strategy and an engaged workforce I am 
more confident than ever that we can 
continue to outperform our competitors and 
deliver excellent returns to our shareholders.

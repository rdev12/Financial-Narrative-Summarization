CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Since joining in April 2015, I have completed 
a strategic review focused on evaluating  
the specialisations of each of our businesses, 
assessing their future potential and determining 
how to best increase their growth rates. As  
a result, the Group is undergoing a number  
of significant changes, which will allow its 
constituent businesses to deliver their  
full potential.
Paul Taaffe Chief Executive Officer
DELIVERING OUR  
FULL POTENTIAL
Achieving our strategic objectives 
requires having outstanding and 
talented people at every level of our 
businesses. During 2015 we have 
refreshed the senior management 
teams in a number of our agencies, 
invested in talent to facilitate growth 
in the businesses with the most 
potential, and put in place incentive 
schemes to better align key talent with 
Group objectives. Establishing the 
right talent in each market will drive 
new business wins and enable us to 
improve client retention, delivering both 
organic revenue and profit growth.
Alongside these investments, we 
have looked to right-size the cost 
base of each business by redeploying 
resources, closing offices where 
necessary and restructuring others 
to align them to market needs. The 
second half of 2015 focused on 
completing this restructuring, which 
positions each of our businesses for 
sustainable profit growth in 2016 and 
beyond. I am pleased to say that, as 
the Group ended 2015, the majority of 
this restructuring is now complete.
When we announced our interim results, 
I looked forward to a second half year 
in which Huntsworth Health would 
continue on its double-digit growth 
trajectory and Grayling would return to 
stronger profitability after a poor first 
half year. I am pleased to report that 
the Group delivered on both of these 
expectations, although in Grayling’s 
case, these are still early days and we 
continue to see some volatility in trading. 
Group performance overview
Full year results for 2015 have been 
mixed. Revenue grew by 1.5% on a 
like-for-like basis, returning Huntsworth 
to revenue growth for the first time 
since 2011. Operating margin before 
central costs and highlighted items 
was 13.1% (2014: 15.0%). This represents 
an absolute year-on-year reduction in 
operating profit before central costs 
of £2.6 million. Operating loss after 
highlighted items was £37.8 million 
(2014: £56.9 million) which includes 
goodwill impairment charges of £48.8 
million (2014: £71.5 million). Full year 
profit before tax and highlighted items 
was £13.3 million (2014: £16 million). Strategic

Annual Report and Accounts 2015 / Huntsworth plc 07
Central costs for 2015 of £6.9 million 
have exceeded the 2014 level by 5.5%, 
largely due to the dual running of 
my costs from April with those of my 
predecessor, Lord Chadlington, who 
continues to act as Special Adviser until 
6 April 2016. I would like to acknowledge 
Peter’s personal contribution to the 
Group he led over many years. I would 
also like to thank Brian Porritt, our 
interim CFO, who successfully led 
the restructuring process in 2015.
Interest costs for the year were 
£2.0 million, a reduction of £0.2 
million compared to 2014. The Group’s 
effective tax rate has increased to 27% 
as the continued growth of Huntsworth 
Health increases the proportion of the 
Group’s profits that arise in the US.
The combination of the above 
elements results in adjusted 
diluted earnings per share of 3.0p 
compared with 3.7p in 2014.
Working capital management 
and further net debt reduction 
were priorities for the Group 
during the year, with net debt at 
31 December 2015 reducing to 
£30.4 million (2014: £35.6 million).
Divisional performance overview
Huntsworth Health
Huntsworth Health is now the Group’s 
largest division by both revenue and 
profit. It has a strong portfolio of 
specialist healthcare communications 
agencies that have continued to deliver 
double-digit revenue growth whilst 
maintaining strong operating margins. 
Revenue growth accelerated in H2 2015, 
reaching 13.7% on a like-for-like basis for 
the full year (H1: 11%; H2: 16.3%). These 
growth rates are well above industry 
averages, and represent a very strong 
result. This growth was led by Evoke 
Health, our digital consumer agency.
Revenue growth has been driven 
through expansion of key client 
relationships, significant new client 
wins, and a focused approach to 
solving the myriad of challenges facing 
our clients as the healthcare world 
continues its rapid change. Huntsworth 
Health’s top five clients delivered 
£29.4 million of revenue in 2015, 
compared to £20.6 million in 2014.
Awards won in 2015 include the 2015 
LTEN Provider Innovation Award Winner, 
Pharma Times: 2015 International 
Communications Agency Team of the 
Year Winner, Communiqué Awards 
2015 Finalist: Writing Excellence – 
HCPs (Novo Nordisk), PM Society 
Awards: 2015 Gold Winner, Craft 
Award for Primary Care Campaign 
(AstraZeneca) and IPA Best of Health 
Awards 2015 Bronze Award: Consumer 
(patient) Film Campaign (Vertex).
New business momentum is solid 
entering 2016 and the foundation 
has been set for continued organic 
revenue and operating profit 
growth with sustained operating 
profit margins in 2016. 
Huntsworth Health continues to 
establish and build new growth 
platforms with a new full-service digital 
marketing agency FIRSTHAND opened 
in Q4 2015 and a digital consulting 
business TraverseHealth opening in 
Q1 2016. Huntsworth Health is also 
growing revenues in the expansion 
markets of Asia Pacific and the Middle 
East, where we have opened new 
offices in Shanghai and Dubai.
We have also invested in talented 
teams in our other specialist agencies, 
with several ending the year under 
new senior management, and with 
strong momentum. Huntsworth 
Health is well placed to continue its 
strong performance into 2016.
Grayling
Grayling revenues fell 7.4% on a like-
for-like basis for the full year, although 
the rate of decline slowed with each 
successive quarter. Similarly, operating 
margin, whilst only 4.2% for the full 
year, improved with each quarter. 
Grayling was the focus of the majority 
of the restructuring activity in 2015 – in 
order to halt its decline, right-size its 
cost base and, importantly, to reinvest 
in order to take advantage of the most 
promising growth opportunities. 
This programme included the closure 
of seven offices, with others being 
fundamentally restructured. The 
leasehold property portfolio has 
been rationalised, with consolidations 
in the major cities completed or in 
progress by the end of the year.

A new leadership team is now in place 
following the departure of the CEO and 
CFO in January 2015, and new senior 
management has been appointed in 
a number of significant markets. 
Grayling UK underwent significant 
transition in 2015. The business saw a 
change in leadership midway through 
the year and a restructuring of the 
business in Q4 to create a more focused, 
leaner structure for growth in 2016. 
Q4 also saw the merging of Atomic 
into Grayling UK to strengthen its 
consumer and technology proposition 
in the marketplace. Significant wins in 
the second half of the year included 
wide-ranging work with HSBC and 
the prestigious 23
rd
 World Energy 
Congress in Istanbul, in partnership 
with Grayling Turkey. Grayling UK also 
won important strategic projects with 
TFL and a GP recruitment programme 
for the NHS. As we move into 2016, 
Grayling UK is already seeing the 
positive effects of the restructuring 
with some high-profile wins.
Grayling US generated organic 
growth with ZTE, the Chinese mobile 
phone manufacturer, and added 
several significant wins including 
Dechert LLP, Amadeus and integrated 
marketing work for Edmunds.com 
and Lowe’s, the national retailer. 
It expanded its affiliate network 
throughout Latin America and added 
several key hires from professional 
services and technology sectors.

Grayling increased its regional strength 
across Continental Europe, including a 
number of key leadership appointments 
and structural transformations which 
extended the agency’s multi-market 
capabilities. Grayling’s multi-country 
accounts across Continental Europe 
now represent over 50% of the revenue, 
with 35 clients spanning at least 
three markets simultaneously. Major 
regional wins like Croatian National 
Tourist Board (‘CNTB’) are also the 
result of these changes. Grayling 
Spain received an additional boost by 
being named the ‘Best Agency of the 
Year’ by PR Noticias, the most high-
profile award available in Spain.
2015 was a stellar year for Grayling’s 
Middle East, Turkey and Africa (‘META’) 
business, with growth delivered right 
across the region. Grayling’s Africa plan 
got underway with a new office in Kenya 
now acting as the hub for business in the 
East Africa region, and the focus moving 
forward will widen as the same approach 
is taken for West Africa through entry 
into the Nigerian market. At the 2016 
African Excellence Awards Grayling 
won a number of awards, including best 
newcomer agency of the year, best 
website, best mobile communication 
and social app, best travel and 
tourism campaign, best social media 
programme as well as being named 
runner-up in the best launch category.
Moving into 2016, whilst the Qatar 
business is set to retract, the 
UAE continues to generate good 
opportunities and larger mandates 
are now coming through in Oman. 
Aside from a broader footprint across 
the region, the business continues to 
diversify with the creative services 
team providing world-class brand 
development programmes through 
to digital applications, exhibition 
support and experiential activations. 
For Grayling Asia, 2015 was a year 
of restructuring and investment; 
the office in Thailand closed, and 
two new MDs were appointed. The 
businesses are now right-sized and 
positioned for future growth. 
Citigate 
Citigate’s individual businesses have 
performed very differently in 2015.
Citigate First Financial in the 
Netherlands achieved 26.6% like-
for-like revenue growth and strong 
operating margins. Citigate’s Asian 
businesses also delivered strong 
margins on 2.9% revenue growth.
By contrast, Citigate’s London 
businesses suffered a like-for-like 
revenue decline of 16.9% and a 
sharp drop in operating margins. 
As announced at the half year, price 
competition for mandates remains 
strong and, in London, the business 
continues to face a challenging 
environment, which is reflected in the 
full year figures. A new investment 
programme, which began in the second 
half of the year, continues to progress 
with the aim of strengthening Citigate’s 
positioning, offering and margins.
Despite operating in a tough 
environment, Citigate continued to 
demonstrate its leading position in IPO 
communications by advising on key 
UK, European and Asian IPOs in 2015. 
These included Ibstock, On the Beach, 
Sanne Group and HSS Hire in the UK; 
ABN AMRO and Flow Traders in the 
Netherlands; OSE Pharma and Abivax 
in France, Nordic Nanovector in Norway 
and Jumbo Group in Singapore. 
Citigate had a stronger second half than 
first half and the division looks to return 
to growth in 2016. A number of new 
and important mandates were secured 
in the last few months of the year, 
notably QinetiQ, Charter Court Financial 
Services, Saudi Electricity Company, 
Allied Minds, Silverfleet Capital, 
Collinson, Momentum Pensions, Global 
Jet Capital, Gama Aviation and Source.
Red
Red Consultancy grew 4.2% in 2015 on 
the back of strong demand for consumer 
campaigning as well as growth in 
corporate and technology services. 
Operating margins were maintained 
at Red’s long-term level of 20%.
Notable highlights included the 
launch of McDonald’s Signature range 
of premium burgers; the launch of 
the latest instalment of the world’s 
most popular video game, Call of 
Duty Black Ops III, for Activision; 
and Carling’s Brighton or Barbados 
campaign for Molson Coors. All of these 
high-profile campaigns saw media 
relations, social media and events 
combined to create major impact.
New clients won during 2015 included 
leading housebuilders Crest Nicholson, 
Heathrow Airport, SlimFast, Listerine, 
and Royal Caribbean cruises.
Many industry awards were won 
for the agency’s lauded work for 
NHS’s Blood and Transplant service, 
as well as for work for McDonald’s, 
Samsung and Allergan.
The agency’s outstanding talent 
development was recognised 
with its second Media Employer 
of the Year award.
Growth momentum and organic 
investment plans give encouragement 
for continued improvements in 2016.
Group outlook
2015 has been a year in which the 
underlying cost base has been largely 
addressed and resources invested 
to appropriately position each of 
our businesses for the future.
The full year benefits of the 
restructuring, along with the 
introduction of new senior management 
at a number of our individual agencies 
and other investment initiatives, leaves 
the Group well placed to achieve 
stronger revenue growth and an 
improved profit performance in 2016.

Pfizer VTEAM:  
A PHARMA FIRST
Pfizer has worked in the thrombosis  
field for decades. With limited resources, 
the goal was to establish a platform for 
sustained engagement with UK 
healthcare professionals and facilitate 
peer-to-peer education and best practice 
sharing in cancer-associated thrombosis 
management. We developed a Pfizer-
first programme combining social media 
and an online community for multi-
disciplinary healthcare professionals in 
the UK. The community was launched 
with a week-long online event including 
individual case presentations by expert 
faculty and live commentary culminating 
in a live panel hour-long discussion on 
LinkedIn. The combination and successful 
use of social media in a professional 
healthcare professional campaign  
was heralded as innovation and 
sustainable professional education and 
communications with event promotion 
driven by email, Twitter and LinkedIn 
adverts, LinkedIn inMail and faculty 
endorsement in their social networks. 12 Huntsworth plc / Annual Report and Accounts 2015

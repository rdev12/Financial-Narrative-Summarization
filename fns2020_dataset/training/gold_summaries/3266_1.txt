 Chief Executive’s Review
Results
2002/03 proved to be a particularly
difficult year for manufacturing
industry in the UK, and Chamberlin
& Hill was no exception. Turnover,
down 10.8% at the interim stage,
fell to £27.0m for the year as a
whole compared to £30.5m in
2001/02, a fall of 11.5%. At this
level sales were broadly in line with
the national statistics for production
output for engineering and allied
industries. Margins fell as the effect
of fixed costs took their toll; net
operating margin for the year was
5.1% compared to 8.3% last time.
We again experienced demands
for price down as well as pressure
from higher costs. Of significant
importance this year was the near
25% increase in the cost of many
of the major raw materials for
our foundries in the last quarter of
the year. 
Foundry sales fell by 9.4% to
£18.0m. This fall occurred mainly
at Walsall and Bloxwich with a
small reduction at Ductile Castings.
A similar picture emerged in our
engineering businesses, where
the reduction in sales at PFP was
some 13.1% and at FD 17.3%.
Sales per head fell to £57,800, the
first fall for 10 years. Our export
sales grew in real volume,
increasing to 17.1% of the group’s
total compared to 14.7% in
2001/02. At the trading level,
profit in the foundries fell to
£1.094m while in the engineering
businesses it was £0.744m. 
To accommodate the downturn
in activity we instigated some
restructuring, leading to a fall in the
number of employees to 438 at
the year end with an associated
exceptional cost of £316,000. A
further exceptional amount of
£135,000 has been provided
against stock at PFP as a
consequence of its changing
markets, and changed position
within ongoing markets. In
particular a different pattern of
sales emerged in the market for
electrical conduit fittings, where
most supplies are now imported
from low cost economies. This also
had an impact on the market
position and volume of business at
Bloxwich Foundry.
Investment
Capital expenditure for the year
was £1.71m. The major item was
the installation of the assets bought
at the beginning of the year from
H. Bingham & Sons, Doncaster, on
the Scunthorpe site. The new
foundry, producing steel and
SG iron castings, was commissioned
in June 2002. Since that time good
progress has been made with
sales reaching an annual rate of
approximately £1m by the year
end with a positive contribution to
operating profit. A number of new
customers are currently being
brought on stream. Other
investments include the purchase
of further Barinder robotic grinding
machines and investment in new
market opportunities at Walsall
Foundry. There has been further
development of our Exidor range
and investment for successful
margin improvement in the
manufacture of our range of
Webb Lloyd handles at FD. At
PFP we increased our capacity to
assemble switch & socket boxes,
also achieving a considerable
productivity improvement.
Outlook
In our foundry businesses we
are concentrating on both
consolidating our entry into new
markets and further rationalisation.
These initiatives include increasing
our output at Bloxwich Foundry of
ductile iron castings, particularly
within the automotive and general
CHAMBERLIN & HILL Plc  Annual Report 2003 4 5
engineering sector, and further
extending our production of
austempered ductile iron (ADI). At
Walsall we expect to expand our
activity in the production of
castings for turbo charging
applications and hydraulic control.
Opportunities in markets for
compressors, railway applications
and construction should enable
Ductile Castings to achieve growth
in volume and efficiencies in the
new foundry in the year ahead. In
our engineering businesses we will
be seeking at FD to expand
our market position as well as
continuing to launch other new
products in the Exidor range. We
also look to extend our activity into
the wider European market in the
year ahead. At PFP we will increase
our range of cable management
products, as well as actively seeking
growth in this sector. There will
also be some further new products
in our range of hazardous area
lighting. 
For the future we are looking to
build on the foundations put in
place this year. We will develop
sales in a number of new markets,
improve operating margins and
increase the contribution from
Ductile Castings following our
investment there. We are
cautiously optimistic that demand
will grow as the year progresses,
albeit slowly. We intend to ensure
that productivity gains continue to
be achieved in all our operations.
Our acquisition strategy remains
one of pursuing appropriate
opportunities as and when they
become available.
Once again, I would like to thank
most sincerely all the members of
our team for their hard work and
diligence during the year.

Overview
We have had another year of strong 
progress at MITIE, with double-digit 
growth in revenue, earnings and 
dividends. This is an excellent 
performance against a UK economic 
backdrop that remains challenging 
and is a testament to the passion and 
hard work of our people. 
During the year, we have made excellent 
progress on our key strategic initiatives, 
continuing to invest in our people, 
technology, facilities management (FM) 
and energy propositions as well as our 
overseas capability. We were delighted 
to retain and expand contracts with  
Rolls-Royce and Vodafone which 
conﬁrmed our strategy of providing 
integrated FM and energy services. 
We also acquired Dalkia FM in Ireland 
and made a signiﬁcant investment in the 
fast developing decentralised energy 
market. We start the new ﬁnancial year 
in a strong and conﬁdent position.
Results
During the year, revenues grew by 10.0% 
to £1,891.4m (2010: £1,720.1m). Operating 
proﬁt before other items increased by 
16.5% to £108.3m (2010: £93.0m), reﬂecting 
an improved margin of 5.7% (2010: 5.4%). 
Proﬁt before tax and other items increased 
by 15.3% to £105.7m (2010: £91.7m). 
Earnings per share before other items 
grew by 15.9% to 22.6p per share (2010: 
19 .5p per share). 
We have retained our strong focus 
on cash, reporting cash inﬂows from 
operations of £102.5m (2010: £98.4m) 
for the year, which represents excellent 
conversion of EBITDA to cash of 
86.7% (2010: 95.2%). The balance sheet 
is extremely strong with net debt at the 
year end at 0.65 times EBITDA at £7 6.5m 
(2010: £86.6 m), after using debt funding 
of £7 .3m for an acquisition. 
We have recently reﬁnanced our bank 
facilities and now have committed 
bank facilities of £250m until September 
2015, which will be available for draw 
down after the AGM. We also drew down 
£100m equivalent of US Private Placement 
debt in December 2010, in a mix of notes 
which mature between seven and nine 
years. Both of these facilities leave us in 
a strong position to take advantage of 
value-creating acquisition opportunities 
as they arise. 
We continue to see strong growth in 
our order book, which increased by 
6.3% during the year and now stands 
at a record £6.8bn (2010: £6.4bn). 
Our sales pipeline currently stands at 
£1 1.4bn and our contracted revenue for 
the year ending 31 March 2012 is 81% of 
budgeted revenue (2010: 75%). 
Dividend
We continue to generate attractive 
dividends and dividend growth for 
our shareholders. The Board has 
recommended an increased ﬁnal 
dividend of 4.9p per Ordinary share, 
providing a total dividend per share for 
the year of 9 .0p, a 15.4% increase on 2010. 
This is consistent with our dividend policy 
to maintain dividends in line with 
underlying earnings per share growth 
at a cover ratio of 2.5 times adjusted 
earnings. Subject to shareholder 
approval at the Annual General Meeting, 
the dividend will be paid on 12 August 
201 1 to shareholders on the register at 
24 June 201 1.
Board
After serving for 1 7 years at MITIE, of 
which nine have been on the Board, 
Roger Goodman stepped down 
as a PLC Director on 31 March 201 1. 
We thank him for his valuable 
contribution to the Board.
People
We would like to thank all of our people 
for  their exceptional efforts and support 
and to welcome the 5,327 people who 
joined us during the year. We are now 
a company of 61,906 individuals, which 
makes us one of the UK’s largest private 
sector employers. 
In particular, we would like to welcome 
those who joined us following our 
acquisition of Dalkia FM in Ireland.
It is our talented, dedicated people 
who allow us to achieve consistently 
strong results and maintaining the 
motivation of our people is critical to our 
future success. We remain focused on 
recognising and rewarding exceptional 
team performance, nurturing talent and 
providing opportunities for our people 
to succeed in their careers.
Outlook
MITIE is in an excellent position. We 
continue to focus on organic growth, 
supplemented by selective acquisitions 
and the development of our integrated 
business model overseas.
We have a diverse, high-quality client 
base across both the public and private 
sectors, which underpins our consistent 
track record. This has enabled us to 
continue investing in our people, 
technology and new markets, all of 
which supports our strong order book 
and growing sales pipeline.
There are exciting opportunities in our 
markets, as clients across the board 
look to introduce further innovation and 
efficiencies into their businesses. We are 
ﬁnancially robust and have a clear 
strategy for the development of our 
business. We are conﬁdent that MITIE will 
continue to build on its long track record 
of sustainable, proﬁtable growth.

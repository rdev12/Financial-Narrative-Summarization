Genetix	 Group	 plc	 Annual	 Report	 &	 Accounts	 2005
“ Our cell biology 
instrumentation  
has been shown to 
add real value by 
giving customers a 
significant return on 
their investment.”
Introduction
Genetix achieved an increase in  
profit before tax of 72% compared 
with the previous year, with the Group 
benefiting from the uptake of its cell 
biology instrumentation in the final 
quarter. During this latter part of the 
year interest in these new products 
intensified. Biopharmaceuticals –  
drugs based on large complex protein 
molecules produced in living systems  
in contrast to chemically synthesised 
pharmaceutical drugs – are a major 
advance in modern medicine. It is  
in this area that our cell biology 
instrumentation has been shown to 
add real value by giving customers a 
significant return on their investment 
by increasing productivity of cell lines, 
antibody development and drug  
target validation.
The market/underlying trends
The emphasis in drug research 
continues to shift toward 
immunological and biological 
approaches, which target biochemical 
receptors and signalling pathways and 
it is believed that the emergence of this 
approach, as a major force within drug 
discovery, will provide the Group with 
increased opportunities for its new 
products developed within the field  
of cell biology. As a consequence, the 
number of sales leads generated within 
the biopharmaceutical market is 
expected to increase during 2006. 
Furthermore, we are excited with  
the increased scope to develop our 
consumables and reagents into areas 
which complement our cell biology 
instrumentation. The Group continues 
to maintain its presence within the 
microarraying sector and while  
this market continues to mature, 
opportunities remain to be exploited 
against the background of a 
consolidating market.

Performance review
The Group achieved turnover of  
£12.1 million (2004: £12.2 million)  
with a high quality revenue stream  
and profit before tax of £2.3 million 
(2004: £1.3 million). The increase in 
profitability reflects an improvement  
in instrumentation margins together  
with a reduction of operating costs. 
The Group is managed as a single fully 
integrated business at all levels, and 
therefore represents a single business 
line. However, within our single 
business segment we do identify  
our turnover from each part of the 
business. Instrumentation sales were 
£9.3 million, an increase of 1% on 
2004, including a strong performance 
from our picking and cell biology range 
of products. Consumables and services 
turnover was £2.8 million, down 6% 
on 2004. Going forward we have 
adopted a more integrated approach 
with our consumables being 
increasingly complementary with  
our new instruments. New products 
accounted for approximately 20%  
of total sales.
The Group finished the year with a 
cash balance of £24.3 million.
Sales and marketing
New appointments within the  
sales function will take place in 2006 
with the aim of strengthening the 
existing team in key markets such as 
the United States. Emphasis will also  
be given to training and support 
required to address increasingly 
complex and protracted procurement 
processes associated with the 
biopharmaceutical sector. www.genetix.com

New Product development
It has been another productive year for 
Genetix’ product development as the 
Group continues to add to its range of 
products including the following:
 CloneSelect
imager
 – an instrument 
dedicated to cell confluence and 
growth measurement;
 Cell Dispense and CloneFill – new 
bench-top systems for dispensing 
cells and media respectively into  
well plates;
 a new range of plastics, semi-solid 
media and picking reagents 
complementary to the 
instrumentation products  
associated with cell biology; and
 further development of the QPix 
“XT” platform leading to the 
QP
expression
, an integrated colony 
picker, automating bacterial and 
yeast cloning methods.
During 2006 we have a full pipeline of 
projects which will continue to deliver 
analytical instruments for cell biology, 
as well as a stream of reagents and 
consumables.
Research
Our R&D project teams have remained 
focused on broadening our competencies 
in the field of intelligent cell imaging 
and selection with an emphasis on 
illumination, optics, detection and 
quantitative software.

The priority has been to advance  
these techniques to continually 
improve the productivity of our cell 
biology products to deliver real 
benefits to the drug discovery process 
for biopharmaceuticals. This work has 
been supported by in-house research 
by our team of molecular biologists 
who are engaged in refining 
methodologies which, when combined 
with our products, will further enhance 
productivity for our customers.
Outlook
We expect that continuing enthusiasm 
from customers for our cell biology 
products will translate into increased 
sales revenue in 2006. This, together 
with a sustainable improvement in 
margins achieved from the new 
product range, gives us increased 
confidence in the Group’s prospects.

producing
The Group utilises modern plant and equipment to extract coal 
deposits from surface mines. The majority of coal is used in the 
power generation industry, whilst premium coals are supplied 
to the industrial and domestic markets, making the Group 
one of the largest producers of household coal in the UK.
Restoring
The Group, working closely with third parties including Local 
Authorities and Environmental Agencies, utilises innovative 
techniques to minimise its impact on the environment. 
Surface mines undergo progressive restoration during coal 
extraction periods and, following the completion of mining 
activities, land is returned to an agreed condition and profile.

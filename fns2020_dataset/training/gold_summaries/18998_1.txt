Growth in the rental market
 The private rented sector was characterised 
by long-term decline in the 20th Century
 The trend reversed in the 1990s and from a 
low of 9% of UK households living in private 
rented in 1999 has risen to 18% in 2012-13, a 
doubling from 2.0m to 4.0m in England over 
15 years
 Savills forecast 5.7m UK households in private 
rented by 2018
 Savills and Rightmove estimate that rents 
paid on private rented properties were £48bn 
in 2011 rising to £70bn in 2017. Implying 7.4% 
per annum growth in revenue opportunities

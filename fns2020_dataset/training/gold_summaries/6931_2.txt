Syria
Gulfsands owns a 50% working interest in, and is the 
operator of, Block 26 in north-east Syria under  
a production sharing contract (“PSC”). The block 
covers approximately 8,250 km
2
 and encompasses 
existing fields which currently produce over 100,000 
bopd of medium gravity 20–26° API crude oil 
primarily from mid-Cretaceous limestone reservoirs. 
These fields, which are carved out of the PSC, are 
operated by third parties including the Syrian 
Petroleum Company, but Gulfsands retains the deep 
exploration rights (pre-Triassic) beneath these fields. 
Gulfsands has made two discoveries on Block 26: Khurbet 
East (June 2007) and Yousefieh (November 2008). 
Commercial approval to develop Khurbet East was granted 
in February 2008 and production commenced in July 2008. 
In the last quarter of 2008 the field had average gross crude 
oil production in excess of 10,000 bopd, with an API in 
excess of 25°. Proven and probable reserves attributable to 
Gulfsands at 31 December 2008 were 28.7 mmbbl (working 
interest), 10.9 mmbbl (entitlement). The Yousefieh discovery 
will undergo full appraisal during 2009, and the Group 
expects to obtain approval for commercial development of 
this discovery during the year. Having previously acquired 400 
km
2
 of 3D seismic data, Gulfsands is in the process of 
acquiring an additional 850 km² of 3D seismic over Block 26 
during 2009.
The current exploration period for Block 26 expires in 
August 2010 but may be extended at the Contractor’s 
option for a further two years. The minimum work 
commitments for the current exploration period have 
already been satisfied. The development and production 
period for Khurbet East expires in February 2033 (25 years 
after commercial approval) but may be extended at the 
Contractor’s option for a further 10 years.
 
The Company has also formed a strategic partnership with 
Cham Holding, a prominent local industrial group, for the 
purpose of acquiring additional oil and gas projects in Syria 
and Iraq. Gulf of Mexico

Iraq
Gulfsands has been conducting business 
development activities in Iraq since 2003 and has 
formed a subsidiary for its operations in Iraq as well 
as opened an office in Baghdad. 
In January 2005 the Group signed a Memorandum of 
Understanding with the Ministry of Oil in Iraq for the Maysan 
Gas Project in Southern Iraq, following completion of a 
feasibility study in August 2004, and is currently finalising 
details of a definitive contract. The project involves the 
engineering, procurement, construction and operation of a 
gas gathering system, gas liquids plant and power plant that 
will gather, process and transmit natural gas currently being 
flared as a waste by-product of oil production, and will produce 
electricity to supply the local grid. The project has regional 
importance not only because of the acute need for power in 
the area but also because the present practice of gas flaring 
results in significant environmental damage to the region. 
Gulfsands is actively engaged in discussions with respect to 
financing and potential equity partners.
The Group’s primary medium term objective in Iraq is to 
secure oil and gas exploration and developments projects, 
and discussions have taken place with certain third parties 
with this intent. The Group has no reserves in Iraq at present.
USA
In the USA Gulf of Mexico, Gulfsands owns interests 
in 44 blocks comprising approximately 138,000 
gross acres in shallow water offshore Texas and 
Louisiana, which include 30 producing oil and gas 
fields. All of these fields are operated by third 
parties. The Group also has an interest in one 
onshore gas field in Texas. 
Working interest production in the last quarter of 2008 
averaged 700 boepd, compared with 1,875 boepd in  H1 
2008, having been adversely impacted by Hurricanes Ike 
and Gustav in Q3 2008.
Proven and probable reserves at 31 December 2008 were 
5.1 mmboe (working interest), 3.9 mmboe (net revenue 
interest), of which some 46% was oil and 54% gas. 
Our principal area of activity is 
in Syria, where we operate the 
Block 26 concession in the 
North East. We also have non-
operated minority interests  
in the Gulf of Mexico and  
a nascent business in Iraq. 04

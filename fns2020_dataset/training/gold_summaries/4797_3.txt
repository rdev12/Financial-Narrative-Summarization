 Diploma PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2005 Chairman’s Statement 3
Chairman’s Statement
The Group delivered
another strong set of
results in 2005, achieving
a second consecutive 
year of double digit
profit growth and 
strong free cash flow.
Diploma has made good progress again this
year. Each of our business sectors delivered 
a solid performance which demonstrates 
the momentum in the Group as a result
of targeted initiatives implemented during
the past five years. 
STRONG RESULTS
Turnover increased by 11% to £111.3m 
(2004: £100.5m) and operating profits,
before goodwill amortisation and exceptional
items, increased by 29% to £15.9m 
(2004: £12.3m). The operating results
benefited from the full year contribution 
from Somagen, acquired in July 2004 and
from a strong performance from Hercules
Bulldog. Both businesses took full advantage
of favourable market conditions in North
America. The Group’s operating margin,
before goodwill amortisation, increased 
from 12.2% in 2004 to 14.3% in 2005.
Profit before tax, goodwill amortisation 
and exceptional items increased by 27% 
to £16.6m (2004: £13.1m). There were no
exceptional items this year, while last year’s
results benefited from exceptional profits of
£3.9m on the sale of land. As a result profit
before tax was £15.3m compared with
£15.4m last year.
The Group’s free cash flow was exceptionally
strong this year at £11.9m (2004: £9.6m)
benefiting from a continuing close focus on
working capital. Last year’s free cash flow
included cash proceeds of £4.0m from the
sale of land and properties. The Group’s cash
funds increased by £7.8m during the year to
£25.7m at 30 September 2005.
EARNINGS AND DIVIDENDS
Earnings per share, before exceptional items
and goodwill amortisation, grew 27% to 
52.4 pence compared with 41.2 pence last
year. Basic earnings per share were 46.6
pence compared with 52.7 pence last year.
The Directors are recommending an
increased final dividend of 13.0 pence per
share (2004: 11.0 pence). This increases
the total dividend payment for the year to
20.0 pence (2004: 17.0 pence), an increase
of 18%. Subject to approval at the Annual
General Meeting, the final dividend will 
be paid on 18 January 2006 to shareholders
on the register at the close of business on 
2 December 2005.
PEOPLE
On behalf of shareholders and the Board, 
I would like to acknowledge the dedication
of our people across all our operations
whose hard work and commitment have
been key to achieving the progress made
in 2005.
CURRENT TRADING
The outlook for our markets in 2006,
together with wider macro-economic
indicators, is somewhat mixed. The
markets in North America remain positive
and continue to show growth. Market
conditions in the UK and Germany remain
tough and competitive.
We are confident that our focus on improving
operational performance, together with our
strategy of investing for organic growth and
pursuing acquisitions, will continue to deliver
value for Diploma shareholders in 2006.

Highlights – 2008
Revenues for the period increased 7% to $103.6 •	
million (2007: $97.2 million).
Average production decreased 17% to 4,809 boe/d •	
(2007: 5,760 boe/d), partly due to the impact of two 
major hurricanes in the USA. Year to date production 
in 2009 has averaged 4,694 boe/d.
EBITDA increased to $65.1 million (2007: $56.6 million). •	
Falls of 61% in oil prices and of 25% in gas prices •	
between the end of 2007 and 2008 resulted in 
lowered fixed asset values and triggered non-cash 
pre-tax impairment charges of $180.1 million. 
Accordingly an operating loss of $175.2 million 
resulted (2007: profit $1.8 million).
 Operating profit of $7.7 million before impairment •	
charges (2007: $1.8 million).
Proved plus probable (“2P”) oil and gas reserves at the •	
end of 2008 were down 14% at 18.3 million boe.
Placing of £13.5 million at 2 pence per share in •	
October 2008.
Since the start of 2008, Sterling has repaid $41.4 •	
million (27%) of its bank debt, which currently stands 
at $112.2 million. In 2008 the falls in prices of oil by 
75% and gas by 58%, from their peaks, and continued 
gas price weakness in 2009 has resulted in a marked 
reduction in the Group’s Borrowing Base debt 
availability. Sterling’s debt is above the calculated 
available level and a waiver was agreed with its banks 
in April 2009 until mid-August 2009. Sterling is subject 
to certain restrictions and approvals under the waiver. 
A strategic solution is being sought to enable 
repayment of the existing debt gap of $25.3 million in 
advance of expiry of the waiver, in addition to further 
repayments forecast to then fall due. A further review 
will take place at that time. Cash balances are 
currently $4.3 million.
Increased activity in Kurdistan on the Sangaw North •	
PSC with a 325km 2D seismic programme completed 
over the block in late 2008. Sterling retains a 53.33% 
interest (40% fully diluted) in the block after farming it 
out. Sterling recovered all past costs and has a carry 
through the seismic and the first well up to the point  
of testing.
Recent interpretation of the Kurdistan seismic •	
confirms that the extensive anticline evident at the 
surface is also present in the subsurface where a very 
large structural closure is evident.
Good progress has been made in the evaluation of the •	
Ampasindava and Ambilobe PSC’s, Madagascar, 
where several large structures have been identified, 
with Sifaka one of the largest. A site survey on the 
Sifaka prospect has been conducted and a potential 
drilling location identified. 
Prospectivity studies over the Ntem block, offshore •	
Cameroon (Sterling 100%), have identified a number of 
significant prospects. The maritime border dispute 
that has delayed drilling is understood to be close to 
being settled.
A conditional sale of the USA assets announced in •	
September 2008 was not completed. This was due to 
the impact of the banking and credit crisis and the 
major falls in energy prices since then. A sale remains 
central to Sterling’s strategy.
2008 drilling in the USA resulted in 9 out of 18 •	
successful wells. Results so far in 2009 have improved 
markedly. Activity is now focused on bringing on 
near-term production and improving reserve 
classification.

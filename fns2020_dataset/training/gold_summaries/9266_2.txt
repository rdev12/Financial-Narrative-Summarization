Strategic report: Overview
LampreLL  
at a gLance
Lamprell delivered exceptional financial performance 
in 2014 as a result of strong project execution.  
2014 saw us deliver nine major projects, a record 
for the Company . The Group was successful in 
converting a significant proportion of its bid  
pipeline with six new build jackup rig orders won  
and a number of other smaller awards signed.  
The year also saw the Company achieve significant 
milestones by completing its largest rig conversion 
project (“MOS Frontier”) and delivering the last of  
the problematic projects (the Caspian Sea jackup  
rig “Mercury”). Both the Land Rigs and Engineering 
& Construction business units, while still relatively 
small contributors, saw significant growth during 
2014. The debt refinancing and the rights issue  
were completed in 2014 and have re-established  
the Group with a strong balance sheet.

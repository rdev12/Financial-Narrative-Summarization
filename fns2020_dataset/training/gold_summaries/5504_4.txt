Track record of delivering sustainable growth
It	is	EnQuest’s	intention	to	deliver	sustainable	growth	by	
focusing	on	exploiting	its	existing	reserves,	commercialising	
and	developing	discoveries,	converting	contingent	
resources	into	reserves	and	pursuing	selective	acquisitions.	
EnQuest	believes	it	is	establishing	a	track	record	of	
delivering	on	all	of	these	fronts.	The	reserves	table	below	
shows	EnQuest’s	strong	reserves	replacement	ratio	of	
419%	in	2011.	The	Group’s	Proven	and	Probable	Reserves	
have	been	audited	by	a	recognised	Competent	Person	in	
accordance	with	the	definitions	set	out	under	the	2007	
Petroleum	Resources	Management	System	and	supporting	
guidelines	issued	by	the	Society	of	Petroleum	Engineers.
principal assets
EnQuest’s	principal	assets	at	the	end	of	2011	were	its	
interests	in	the	Heather,	Broom,	Thistle,	Deveron,	West	Don,

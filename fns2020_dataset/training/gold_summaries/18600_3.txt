Chairman’s Statement
Good Energy’s strategic objectives for 2015 were 
to grow its customer base, to continue to invest in 
renewable generation capacity and to diversify its 
funding stream to support this investment.
In 2015, overall customer numbers grew by 44% and 
Good Energy invested in bringing four new solar sites 
on stream, making a total as at year end of six. It also 
drew down £18.6m of funding from its debt facility to 
support the development of these generation assets.
The company delivered profit before tax of £128k, in 
line with expectations. 
There was considerable focus on the renewable 
energy sector in the UK during the year. The Paris 
climate summit in December 2015 demonstrated 
a renewed commitment by all participating 
governments to take action to address climate 
change.
At the same time, the UK has seen demand for 
renewable energy grow year on year. Nearly a quarter 
of the country’s electricity needs are now being 
met by renewable sources such as wind and solar 
- evidence that there is a clear growth market for 
renewable energy in the medium to long term.
Good Energy, which was set up more than 15 
years ago, continues to offer a proven blueprint 
for a commercially viable and sustainable 100% 
renewable power supply and generation business.
2015 saw a number of changes to UK energy 
policy and subsidy landscape which negatively 
impacted plans for wind and solar development and 
generation. It was also the UK’s warmest year on 
record, resulting in decreased energy usage.
However, as a vertically integrated utility business, 
both generating and supplying renewable  
electricity, Good Energy is well placed to deal  
with such challenges. 
There is evidence of a strong 
growth market for renewables 
in the medium to long term. 
Dividend details
Our dividend policy remains in line with our  
objective to continue to balance an appropriate 
return to shareholders with continued  investment  
in the business.
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 2.3p  
per share (2014: 2.3p). The dividend has been 
maintained, subject to approval at the company’s 
AGM.
Our Strategic Report for 2015 contains contributions  from Good Energy’s 
Chairman, its Chief Executive and its  Chief Financial Officer, in addition to a 
strategic review. Detailed financial information and data can be found in later 
sections of the document.
In September, it announced its new strategic focus 
and five-year business plan. This is designed to 
deliver the company’s growth target of a five-
fold increase in customer numbers (household 
equivalents) from a total of 176,500 as at June 2015 
to approximately 900,000 as at 31 December 2020. 
This will enable Good Energy to leverage scale from 
its operating model in order to deliver sustainable, 
profitable growth.
The strategy focuses on four key areas: 
  Improving efficiency
  Investing in technology to improve  
customer experience
  Developing new and differentiated propositions   
for domestic and business customers
  Identifying scaleable acquisition channels

Good Energy’s ethical approach and focus on 
excellent service has been a consistent driver of 
both customer growth and retention. I’m pleased 
to report that the company scored an impressive 
81% in the latest Which? energy company customer 
satisfaction survey, putting it in second place, 
just one percentage point behind the leader. The 
company has consistently secured first or second 
place in each of the last five years. At the same  
time, Good Energy has topped the three most  
recent Martin Lewis MoneySavingExpert energy 
company polls.
Matters of sustainability and corporate social 
responsibility are becoming increasingly important 
for businesses, and Good Energy received new 
accreditation during the year for its brand promise 
of delivering 100% renewable electricity to its 
customers. Renewable energy supplies are becoming 
of increasing importance to the business sector. The 
company is clearly in a strong position to respond  
to this, backed up by independent accreditation.  
This presents the company with a promising 
commercial opportunity. 
A founder member of the Social Stock Exchange, 
Good Energy is now dual listed on the social impact 
segment of the ISDX, having successfully completed 
a social impact report and passed the high 
standards set by independent auditors.
During the year, the company further invested in 
its management team and leadership capability, 
bringing new people on board with a broad range  
of skills and experience. The benefits of this 
additional strength are already being felt across  
the business. In addition, the company is proposing 
to introduce a long term incentive plan (LTIP) for the 
Executive team.
The business sector presents 
a promising commercial 
opportunity for us.
All these factors provide a good foundation from 
which to support the company’s ambitions for 
growth. There has been an encouraging start to 
2016, with planning permission received for three 
solar farms, and continued momentum in customer 
growth. This gives confidence in the outlook for the 
remainder of the year.
I would like to set on record my thanks to everyone 
at Good Energy for all their hard work and 
dedication throughout what has undoubtedly been a 
challenging year. 
Thanks to their commitment, the company has been 
able to continue to deliver strong customer growth 
and offer great levels of service.
I would also like to thank all our customers for their 
support and commitment in helping us to address 
climate change.
Good Energy commissioned four new solar farms during 2015.

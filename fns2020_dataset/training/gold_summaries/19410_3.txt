 02 Quintain Estates & Development plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010
The Company faced difficult conditions 
during the financial year, but has 
emerged stronger and better placed to 
take advantage of the considerable 
opportunities which it holds.
Until the market changed so 
dramatically in 2007, Quintain relied 
upon the availability of bank debt, 
drawn down against rising valuations, 
to meet recurring costs.
The emergence of the liquidity 
crisis made this an unsustainable way 
to finance the business. In response,  
the Company devised the following 
solution:
•  a significant rights issue to cement 
the financial stability of the Group;
•  the acceleration of the programme 
to expand Fund Management 
and directly-held assets to a level 
whereby the cost of running the 
business is fully covered by income, 
to obviate the reliance on debt; and 
•  an increased focus on the recycling 
of capital from existing assets and 
the introduction, where appropriate, 
of third party capital in order to 
achieve faster progress at Wembley 
and Greenwich.
Good progress is being achieved on 
all three fronts.
The rights issue to raise £183.1m 
was completed successfully in 
December 2009 and the Company now 
has a broader institutional shareholder 
base.
In our specialist sectors of 
healthcare and student housing we 
remain confident of being able to deploy 
our capital on attractive terms and are 
now seeing interesting opportunities 
emerge from the turmoil in the financial 
markets.
The recycling of capital continues. 
In the reporting period we received 
£82.5m from asset sales, including our 
interest in The O2. The offices occupied 
by Transport for London at Greenwich 
have attracted interest from several 
potential purchasers and we continue 
to pursue opportunities to dispose of 
assets with which we have already 
created value.
Our three year business plan 
focuses on the increase of funds under 
management to £2bn and the delivery 
of critical mass at Wembley City.  
As the first step towards achievement 
of these 2013 targets, we have put in 
place a clear operational programme for 
the next 12 months that will bring 
further capital into the business, drive 
progress on our major schemes and 
increase the recurring income 
generated across the Group. Whilst the 
continued uncertainty in the markets 
will no doubt present challenges, the 
business is now in a significantly 
stronger shape and we anticipate  
a year of real progress. 
Chairman’s Statement
“ The business is now 
in a significantly 
stronger shape and 
we anticipate a year 
of real progress.”
William Rucker 
Chairman
Three year business plan
The business is focused on realising 
two key objectives within three 
years: 
•  the first is to double funds under 
management to £2bn
•  the second is to achieve critical 
mass on our Urban Regeneration 
schemes, particularly the 
Western Core of Wembley City

Key Performance Indicators
Quintain aims to deliver exceptional returns in the long term. 
Our target is to achieve upper quartile performance against IPD 
over three time periods: the lifetime of Quintain, ten years 
and ﬁ ve years.
Total return is the movement in net asset value per share, adjusted 
for any dividends paid in the year, as a percentage of the opening 
net asset value per share.
Interest cover is deﬁ ned in our banking covenants as operating 
proﬁ t before net ﬁ nance expenses plus realised surpluses on 
disposals divided by net ﬁ nance costs, excluding mark to market 
adjustments.
Staff retention and motivation is crucial to the creation of value for 
shareholders and happiness at work, measured through a wider 
annual survey, is identiﬁ ed as the most relevant indicator.
This data was not collected prior to 2008.
The IPD performance is measured in comparison to the March 
Universe. 
Gearing is deﬁ ned in our banking covenants as the ratio of net 
borrowings of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries 
to equity shareholders’ funds adjusted for deferred tax and mark 
to market movements.

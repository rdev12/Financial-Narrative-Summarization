CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
Ian Tyler
Cairn’s strategy is to deliver value  
for shareholders from the discovery 
and development of hydrocarbons 
within a sustainable, self-funding 
business model. 
 “We are well positioned to deliver on our exploration 
success and we continue to pursue appraisal 
offshore Senegal. With a strong balance sheet and 
funding in place through to free cash flow from our 
North Sea development assets, our sustainable 
model is in a robust position.” 
We are well positioned to deliver on our exploration 
success and we continue to pursue appraisal offshore 
Senegal. With a strong balance sheet and funding in 
place through to free cash flow from our North Sea 
development assets, our sustainable model is in a 
robust position. Our level of resource is appropriate 
to our existing scale of operations; the Company is 
operating effectively and is well positioned to endure 
the impact of the current oil price environment. 
The prevailing environment presents challenges  
to the industry, but it also presents opportunities. 
From a position of relative financial strength, Cairn 
can allocate capital to value enhancing projects  
while benefitting from reduced operational costs.  
By assessing the appropriate balance of political, 
technical and commercial risks across our asset 
portfolio, we target assets that remain robust  
at low oil prices. 
Senegal provides a material opportunity for Cairn  
to create substantial shareholder value from a world 
class asset. Our significant acreage position offers  
an exciting opportunity which has the potential to  
be transformational to the business, our partners and 
our shareholders. Senegal is an important regional 
hub and provides a firm economic base for a large 
West African population.

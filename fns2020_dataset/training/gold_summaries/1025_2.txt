This Annual report contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Rather, they are based on current views

Travel
Anite supplies systems to help leisure travel 
companies run their businesses profitably. 
Continuing market consolidation results in 
fewer companies managing ever larger 
volumes of travellers. Our technology enables 
them to achieve this while managing costs, 
offering an increasing range of products, and 
improving productivity and customer service.
Network Testing 
Anite helps network operators and  
base-station manufacturers manage  
their businesses efficiently. We supply a 
range of tools to enable them to collect  
and analyse data on coverage and 
performance; and to check that networks 
are strong enough to minimise “dropped” 
calls, and that phones will work on  
different operators’ networks.
Handset Testing
Anite helps chipset and handset 
manufacturers design efficient mobile 
phones, and bring them to market quickly 
and cost-effectively. Our systems enable  
the manufacturers to ensure that their  
new products conform to industry 
standards, meet end-customers’ 
expectations and are able to communicate 
with other devices on all networks.

Annual Report and Accounts For the year ending September 2005
It is always a pleasure to report on a good set of figures
and that is certainly the case for the Group for the year
ended 30 September 2005. The market background
against which we have been operating during those twelve
months has been relatively benign although it did not
always appear that this would be the case.
For the year ended 30 September 2005 your Group’s
profits before tax, before an exceptional item covered later
in this report, and before goodwill amortisation,
amounted to £24.7m against £16.1m in 2004 an increase
of 53%. Fully diluted earnings per share calculated on the
same basis were 8.3p against 5.6p in 2004, an increase of
48%, whilst basic earnings per share, again before an
exceptional item and goodwill amortisation, were 8.7p
against 5.7p, an increase of 53%. Basic earnings were
4.1p per share against 3.5p per share after taking into
account the exceptional item and goodwill amortisation,
still an increase of 17%.
We have continued our past practice of paying dividends in
April and October. On 27 September 2005 we announced a
second interim dividend of 2.5p (2004: 2p) making a total
of 4.5p against 3.5p in 2004, an increase of 29%. We
propose announcing the first interim payment for 2006 at
our AGM on Tuesday 28 February 2006.
When the full Statutory Accounts are published it will be
seen we have anticipated the requirement to prepare
consolidated financial statements under the new
International Financial Reporting Standards and prepared
a report showing the effect of these on our 2005 Results
and Balance Sheet. These Standards may change;
however, applying these in their current state, there would
be no change to earnings per share before goodwill
amortisation and an increase in unadjusted earnings per
share due to the removal of goodwill amortisation. The
restated Balance Sheet will show a reduction in net
assets, from £89 million to £77 million, this is primarily
due to the recognition of pension liabilities. For regulatory
purposes, the effect on our capital will not be significant.
The exceptional item referred to above includes the £5m
contribution made to Fund Distribution Limited for the
benefit of those who lost money in Zero Dividend
Investment Trust shares. The exceptional charge has been
taken to the profit and loss account, plus other directly
attributable costs, less recoveries to date. We do not
believe that any further provision for Split Capital
liabilities is required.

The value of discretionary funds under management on
30 September 2005 had risen to £6.9bn compared with a
figure of £5.6bn a year earlier, an increase of 23%. We are
particularly pleased with this increase, as can be seen
from the figures above; discretionary fund management is
the most profitable part of our business. Putting a single
aggregate transaction through the market and the office
is far more efficient, and there is no doubt that being able
to react to market situations quickly enables us to obtain
a better overall return for our discretionary clients and we
continue to recommend this service to our clients.
Advisory fund management, however, continues to be a
very important area for us and the value of funds under
advisory management in our nominee or sponsored
member account has risen to £6.7bn compared to £5.8bn
a year ago. Many trusts and other long established clients
make use of this service. In addition a number of our new
clients take it as a starting point and clients pay a basic
annual fee.

Annual Report and Accounts For the year ending September 2005
Stocktrade has enjoyed another successful year. The
strategy to concentrate on alliances and corporate clients
has again proved its worth with the number of companies,
to which we provide dealing services, rising above 120
with 37 of those currently in the FTSE 100. We are also
well positioned to take advantage of the increase in
activity within SIPPs, providing execution only dealing
services to the leading SIPP Administrators.
We had anticipated that the PEP/ISA business could come
under pressure as a result of the reduction in the tax
advantages which it enjoys, but we are pleased to report
that withdrawals have been more than offset by new
business transferred in. The fee income has risen to
reflect the increase in the general level of the market.
Over the past twelve months we have strengthened our
Financial Planning Division to enable us to provide the
broadest range of financial advice covering not just
investment but also financial planning, inheritance tax
planning, school fee schemes and pensions advice. Last
year we recruited a further eight financial consultants and
we now have thirty-eight fully qualified consultants who
are based in twelve offices around the country. From there
they can easily visit our other branches and arrange
meetings with clients wherever they are based. We plan to
develop this aspect of our coverage in the coming year.
We opened a branch in Belfast at the end of February
2005. It is trading under the name of Bell Lawrie reflecting
the close links between Northern Ireland and our Scottish
offices. I am pleased to report that it has made a very good
start building a significant client base, we have seven
investment advisers in the branch and we expect it to be a
significant contributor to Group profits in future years.
In London we have welcomed a number of new
investment advisers and also a direct marketing team
which specialises in pensions advice, particularly
important with the approach of ‘A’ day next April. The
latter manage portfolios in conjunction with our well
established and successful model portfolio, or
alternatively with one of our investment managers on our
usual bespoke lines.

Revenues in our Corporate Broking Divisions overall rose
by 10% and there was a gratifying improvement in
margins. The year made a quiet start but momentum
gathered pace significantly in the second half and is
continuing.
During the year we opened a new Corporate Finance
branch in Birmingham which has made an encouraging
start. Additional investment has been made in improving
systems and in recruiting new staff. We have continued to
gain market share through the acquisition of new
corporate clients.
Conclusion
I cannot conclude without thanking all our staff for their
immense effort in achieving this excellent set of figures as
well as our clients for their continued loyal support. The
year has started well and providing markets remain at
current levels or continue to advance steadily, as we are
presently forecasting, then we can expect good progress
from your Group over the coming year.

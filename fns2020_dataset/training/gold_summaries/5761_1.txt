 8 Experian Annual Report 2009
Business review
Chief Executive’s review
Don Robert 
Chief Executive Officer
This performance has been 
delivered in a challenging and 
uncertain environment, caused by 
unprecedented disruption within 
the global financial system. Our 
performance is attributable to the 
breadth of our business and our ability 
to adapt to new market conditions. We 
were quick to refocus our organisation 
towards changing client needs and 
to reduce our cost base. The benefits 
from our cost efficiency programme 
are exceeding our plan. We delivered 
US$80m of cost savings in 2009, and 
today we raise our expectation for total 
annualised savings from fiscal year 
2010 onwards by US$20m to US$150m. 
Global growth strategy
For now, challenges remain for 
some of our clients and in some of 
the regions in which we operate. 
In the US and UK, lenders remain 
focused on account management 
and collections and on addressing 
costs. More broadly across 
these two economies, rising 
unemployment is slowing  
consumer demand. 
However, as the external 
environment begins to stabilise, 
our strategic focus increasingly 
is on nurturing, building and 
harvesting growth opportunities 
for our business. During 2009, we 
invested significantly in new growth 
opportunities, and our plan is to 
invest at a similar level in the year 
ending 31 March 2010.
Experian performed well in 2009. Our organic revenue growth was 3%, 
we expanded our margins by 50 basis points to 23.3% and we delivered 
strong free cash flow of US$736m, up 11%. Benchmark EPS grew 8% 
to 62.3 US cents per ordinary share and we have raised our full-year 
dividend by 8% to 20.0 US cents per ordinary share. 9 Experian Annual Report 2009

Our strategic focus increasingly 
is on nurturing, building and 
harvesting growth opportunities 
for our business 
Focus on data and analytics
Over the past year, Experian has further 
extended its industry-leading market 
position. Innovation is our lifeblood, 
and each year we fund a series of 
new initiatives, as well as upgrading 
products to keep our portfolio fresh and 
vital. The proportion of Group revenue 
arising from products developed in the 
past five years has steadily trended 
upwards and now stands at over 20%. 
Over the coming year, we will fund a 
number of new initiatives organically, 
including identity theft management 
tools within Consumer Direct; 
marketing and analytical product 
extensions in Latin America and Asia 
Pacific; and value-added products in 
North America.
We are also highly focused on 
extending our geographic footprint. We 
are very pleased to have been awarded a 
provisional licence to operate a bureau 
in India, and over the next year we will 
focus on establishing our joint venture 
company and gathering data ahead of 
launch. We are also investing in new 
data sources to support the migration 
of our Spanish bureau to a positive data 
market and in new bureaux investments 
in Morocco and Eastern Europe. 
Drive profitable growth
The majority of our growth today stems 
from more established investments 
and our aim is to sustain this growth. 
Within our B2B businesses we aim to 
be a strategic partner to our clients, 
delivering value-added products, 
through strong sales execution, 
enhanced client experience and flawless 
delivery. Across our B2C operations, 
our strategy is to enhance the consumer 
experience and deliver greater value, 
while building brand equity.
We continue to see significant 
opportunity for growth across:
–  new geographies, such as Latin 
America, where the addressable 
market for both credit risk 
management and high return on 
investment (‘RoI’) marketing is large 
and under-penetrated;
–  new vertical markets, where we have 
increased our investment in UK 
public sector, utilities, US healthcare 
payments and capital markets;
–  new products, for example in scoring, 
risk management, fraud prevention, 
contact data management and 
customer segmentation tools.
Our success here will help offset  
short-term headwinds from 
financial services consolidation and 
recessionary market conditions.
Optimise capital efficiency
We remain committed to maintaining 
a prudent but efficient balance 
sheet. Net debt at the end of the 
year was US$2,110m, after funding 
capital expenditure of US$305m and 
acquisition spend of US$179m. 
Our cash flow is typically second-half 
weighted and we expect net debt to 
remain at a similar level for the next 
six months, excluding any acquisition 
activity. 
Dividend
For the year ended 31 March 2009, we 
have announced a second interim 
dividend of 13.25 US cents per share. 
This gives a full-year dividend of 20.00 
US cents per share, up 8%, and 3.1 
times covered by Benchmark EPS. The 
second interim dividend will be paid 
on 24 July 2009 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 26 
June 2009.
Our people
This has been a difficult year, one of 
the most challenging in our history. 
The consistency and strength of our 
performance reflects the commitment 
and hard work of our people, and I 
would like to take this opportunity 
to thank all our employees for their 
dedication, support and outstanding 
accomplishments over the past year.  10 Experian Annual Report 2009

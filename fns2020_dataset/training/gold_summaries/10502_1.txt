Chief Executive’s Report
Peter Plumb
Chief Executive Officer
This is a great business, with hugely 
dedicated and skilled employees who 
have a passionate focus on helping our 
customers make the most of their money
Q: What have been 
your main priorities and 
achievements in your first 
year as Chief Executive 
Officer? 
A: I was appointed Chief Executive 
Officer during what can only be 
described as an unprecedented 
global financial crisis and a UK 
recession. This, of course, helped 
to shape the main priorities for 
my first year. Those priorities were 
reshaping the business for lower 
volumes, ensuring critical investment 
remained prioritised to capitalise on 
a returning market, as and when it 
happens, and most of all, focusing 
our organisation even further on 
helping our customers make the 
most of their money.
The first six months of the year were 
spent stabilising and reshaping the 
business. We reduced our team by 
approximately 80 people, a burden 
shared across the business and at all 
levels, delivering an annualised 
saving in excess of £2m. 
Our marketing team was challenged 
to deliver ‘more for less’. Our online 
marketing spend including both 
search engine marketing and 
partners was significantly reduced. 
This was delivered through the use 
of sophisticated bid management 
tools and additional investment in 
our marketing team, to harness 
further the benefits our brand, 
expert content and breadth of 
services give us in natural online 
search. We also reduced our offline 
marketing spend. Television 
advertising spend achieved much 
greater ‘cut through’ with our 
‘Savings on household bills’ 
campaign fronted by Peter Jones. 
This campaign played a strong role, 
when combined with our extensive 
PR coverage, in building our brand 
trust with customers. 
In the second half of the year we 
increased our investment in our core 
systems as we continued our focus 
on product development and 
innovation. This resulted in a 
significantly improved motor 
insurance channel being launched in 
beta during the year which went 
fully live in February 2010. In 
January 2010 we also launched an 
improved credit card channel and 
have a programme of delivery in 
place for other major channels in 
2010. Together, this will significantly 
improve our customer proposition 
and customer experience in these 
important channels.
My final and most important priority 
has been to place our customers 
even further into the heart of our 
business. We now run regular focus 
groups, testing out new ideas with 
real customers. We have continued 
to invest in better analytics tools this 
year, giving our design teams 
granular data on how customers use 
and interact with our services.

Q: How have you worked 
with Simon Nixon? 
A: First and foremost, as a major 
shareholder in the Company and as 
an Executive Director, Simon has 
been very supportive of our new 
strategy and vision. On a personal 
level, Simon and I compliment 
each other and work well together. 
Simon’s industry expertise has 
helped me settle into my role 
quickly. 
In his new role, Simon has focused 
on product development and 
innovation across the Group, areas 
he is passionate about and in which 
he clearly has a great deal of 
knowledge and experience. 
Q: Clearly the global 
financial crisis has 
negatively affected 
most businesses. What 
has been the impact on 
Moneysupermarket.com? 
A: As a business working in the 
financial services sector, we have 
clearly and directly been affected by 
the tightening of credit markets and 
downturn in the economy during 2009 
which has made trading challenging.
In 2009, Group revenue declined by 
23% to £136.9m and adjusted 
EBITDA declined by 26% to £36.0m 
from £48.4m in 2008. The Group 
maintained its overall market share 
although it surrendered some share 
in Travel which was managed for 
margin in a declining market.
The Group was able to successfully 
flex its cost base to protect its 
operating margins. The Group has 
remained strongly cash generative and 
ended 2009 with no debt and a cash 
balance of £53.8m after the payment 
of the special dividend and the interim 
dividend on 16 October 2009.
In the first quarter of the year we 
closed the non-core intermediary 
business primarily due to the 
difficulties faced in the mortgage 
market last year.
The Insurance vertical remains the 
Group’s largest vertical, accounting 
for 55% of Group revenue up from 
44% in 2008. Home and travel 
insurance performed particularly 
well, however, the motor insurance 
market remained very competitive in 
2009 with increased advertising 
spend by some competitors. We 
maintained a clear strategy of only 
acquiring visitors at a level which 
made financial sense. This resulted in 
a decline in revenue for the year. 
However in the second half of the 
year following the launch of the 
Peter Jones campaign and 
improvements to the website, the 
Insurance vertical grew over the 
same period last year.
In a year of financial uncertainty for 
our customers, visitors to our Money 
vertical remained consistent. However, 
with a shortage of credit products, 
particularly in the first half of the year, 
revenue decreased in the year by 44% 
to £38.1m. The secured lending market 
in particular suffered from a radical 
reduction in the supply of credit and a 
tightening of underwriting criteria. 
The Travel vertical also suffered in 
2009 with revenue declining by 15% 
to £16.3m following market trends 
and the business was actively 
managed for margin.  12 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  Annual Report 2009

Business Review
Travelsupermarket.com was 
redesigned during 2009, improving 
the customer proposition and 
customer usability of the site. During 
the year, we launched a cruise 
channel, increasing the breadth of 
offering in the Travel vertical. 
Revenue in the Home Services 
vertical declined substantially in 
2009 compared to 2008 chiefly due 
to a year of more stable gas and 
electricity prices compared to 2008. 
During the fourth quarter, the Group 
re-launched its vouchers channel 
enabling customers to obtain 
discounts on a much wider range of 
different products and services.
As a business that concentrates on 
helping every household to make 
the most of their money, our 
customer proposition is more 
important now than ever.
Q: What are your plans for 
2010 and beyond? 
A: The actions we took in 2009 will 
provide a strong platform for 2010 
and I am confident that we will see 
the results of that work during the 
year and into 2011. 
We have set out on pages 4 to 7 the 
key elements of our strategy for 
2010 as we continue to focus on 
how we can help households make 
the most of their money. 
We will continue our development 
momentum across the business, 
ensuring that in 2010 our 
customers continue to receive 
market leading services whilst 
building a better service 
infrastructure for our providers.
We will continue to work closely 
with our providers to ensure that we 
offer our customers the best 
possible range of products and 
deals. Our dedicated rates team 
constantly scour the market for 
changing rates and deals, striving to 
offer customers the capability to 
compare the whole of market and 
best buy products.
Our redeveloped channels provide a 
richer data set on our customers. 
This will ensure we are better placed 
to talk to our customers about 
relevant services and deals. Our 
customer communication 
programme will become an ever 
more important part of our business 
as we build long term relationships 
with our customers.
Most importantly, we will complete 
the rollout of our new advertising 
campaign ‘a great deal easier’ 
fronted by Omid Djalili. Our brand 
adverts were aired in early January, 
shortly followed by our new motor 
insurance adverts in mid January. 
The adverts have been well received 
by our customers.
Q: This seems to be 
different to your strategy 
for 2009. What has 
changed? 
A: Although the recession meant 
that my priority was to stabilise 
the business in a market with 
significantly lower credit availability 
and travel product demand, we 
continued investment in teams and 
technology for the long term good 
of our business. Investments were 
made against the clear strategic 
template I referred to above.
The major changes in strategy  
have been ones of marketing 
priorities and our approach to 
international operations. 
With our new offline marketing 
campaign, we will be looking for 
greater ‘cut through’ than we have 
achieved with previous campaigns. It 
is a very competitive market  
and what you say is potentially  
more important than how much  
you spend.
On international, we have stronger 
ambitions than ever to take our 
model to new markets. However, our 
green field market entry test in 
Germany has taught us a great deal 
this year. Germany, a country whose 
personal finance market did not 
escape the global crisis, has proven to 
be very different to operate in. Our 
innovative personalised loans website 
went live during 2009 and is the most 
sophisticated service in Germany. 
However, we have learnt a great deal 
about the need in Germany to 
support online service offline. In the 
UK, customers are happy to self serve 
but in Germany a degree of offline 
support is required through a 
dedicated telephone support team. 
The economics of such a service is 
much less attractive and indeed 
expensive as an organic entry 
strategy. We are therefore winding 
down this test whilst we explore other 
options for international growth.
Q: What do you see as 
Moneysupermarket.com’s 
key strengths? 
A: We are a business with many 
important strengths. Principally, I see 
them as team, scale and brand.
This year has seen a major 
transformation within our business 
in how we build and enhance our 
website based on customer 
behaviour. We start 2010 with a 
much more agile business, both 
curious and innovative. Although 
2010 will see a continued website 
development plan, our core motor, 
home and credit card channels will 
be able to respond to market  Business Overview Business Review Management Corporate Responsibility Corporate Governance Financial Statements General
13 Moneysupermarket.com Group PLC  Annual Report 2009
changes in almost real time, 
something we certainly were  
unable to do last year. Our new 
executive team brings a strong mix 
of skills to the business ranging from 
blue chip marketing to hands on 
provider experience.
We are the UK’s number one price 
comparison website and our scale 
brings distinct benefits to our 
business in two main ways. Firstly, 
our breadth of services means that 
customers have many reasons to 
visit us throughout the year to make 
the most of their money. This not 
only gives us the financial benefits of 
a diversified product range, but also 
gives us a real opportunity to cross 
sell products from our different 
verticals. Secondly, we gain benefits 
from our marketing efficiency, both 
online and offline, an area that we 
made good progress on in 2009.
Our business is now 10 years old. 
Moneysupermarket.com is a very 
valuable brand which is highly 
recognised and trusted by our 
customers. 
Q: What do you think will 
be the challenges for the 
year ahead?
A: 2010 will be another challenging 
year for the business as we seek 
to execute our strategy outlined 
above and focus on delivering 
our ambitious plans for 2010 and 
beyond. 
There will remain challenges in  
the wider economy this year, 
particularly in the credit markets, 
and it will be critical that we remain 
flexible and responsive to changing 
market conditions and evolving 
customer needs. 
Our breadth of services will however 
continue to be a source of great 
strength. We will continue to focus 
on our customers and on making 
sure that we offer them the best 
range of products, ensuring that 
whatever their financial needs, we as 
a business can help them make the 
most of their money in 2010.
Q: When do you expect 
things to improve? 
A: Clearly 2009 has been a difficult 
year for the Group. However, we 
have maintained market share in key 
verticals and I believe the business 
has now stabilised with the worst 
behind us.
I remain confident that the work we 
are doing across the business and 
the enhancements we have made 
and will continue to make in 2010 
will ensure the Group is well 
positioned to capitalise on its 
strengths when growth returns to 
our markets.
I am very much looking forward to 
2010 and beyond. This is a great 
business, with hugely dedicated and 
skilled employees who have a 
passionate focus on helping our 
customers make the most of their 
money. That’s a good place to start 
2010 from.

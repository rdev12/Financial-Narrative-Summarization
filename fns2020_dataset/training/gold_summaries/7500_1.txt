 increased by 16% to £286.7m (2009: 
£246.6m) driven by high levels of renewals income 
and new policy sales. As reported at our interim 
results, the UK business increased investment 
in marketing in line with our focus on customer 
growth resulting in operating profit
2
 increasing 
by 10% to £95.8m (2009: £87.2m).  
i am pleased to report that the UK business 
achieved a key objective of 3% customer growth 
for the year which was mainly driven by our core 
utility and manufacturer marketing channels.  
This, combined with the continued success of 
cross-sell, enabled the business to deliver gross 
new policy sales of 1.83m (2009: 1.83m).
We are particularly pleased with our retention 
performance having delivered a retention 
rate of 82.5% (2009: 83.0%) which is ahead of 
our expectations at the start of the year. This 
performance reflects the success of a range 
of retention-specific initiatives including the 
introduction of the customer magazine, the use  
of personalised renewals notices and improved 
call centre efficiency. 
The continued success of Combined policies, 
which now represent 17% (2009: 14%) of our 
customers, helped to increase policies per 
customer to 2.32 (2009: 2.23) with income per 
customer growing 14% to £74 (2009: £65). 
Our UK manufacturer warranty business has 
had another successful year with total policies 
growing by 17% to 387,000 (2009: 331,000). We 
have recently signed a long-term agreement 
with Dyson to undertake the marketing and 
administration of their manufacturer extended 
warranty scheme in the UK. 
The addition of Dyson and baumatic earlier in 
the year takes the total number of manufacturer 
partner brands to 24 across the boiler, shower, 
white and brown goods sectors and the pipeline  
of potential partners remains strong. We are  
now actively applying our UK warranty expertise 
and best practice to the development of our 
european warranty business Société Française  
de Garantie (SFG). 
As well as meeting our customer growth targets 
through our core marketing channels, we have 
made good progress with a number of new 
customer growth initiatives aimed at attracting 
customers from outside our core demographic 
through new marketing channels. 
We have made good progress developing our 
pay on use service, One Contact, which is now 
available on a national basis. in September we 
purchased r eactfast, a national emergency 
trades business, which is providing an excellent 
source of new customer leads and emergency 
jobs for our repair networks having been fully 
integrated into our membership operations.

in the energy sector, we announced in march the 
signing of a long-term affinity partner agreement 
with g B o ils, the UK’s leading residential oil 
distributor to offer boiler breakdown cover to their 
oil customers. We believe that this part of the 
domestic energy market represents a significant 
opportunity for us, with over 1m households in the 
UK using oil as their main source of fuel. 
at the start of april we signed a two year 
agreement with npower to market electrical 
breakdown and emergency cover as a customer 
acquisition product and we will be working closely 
with them to develop a range of home assistance 
products during the financial year.
o ur product for l andlords is making good progress 
on the back of direct advertising under the 
h omeserve brand and we are now in discussions 
with a range of potential partners to broaden our 
marketing channels and accelerate take up rates 
for this product. 
discussions with other potential distribution 
partners including credit card companies, iFas 
and travel companies to offer an insured home 
emergency product are progressing well.
We have continued to improve the efficiency of our 
network during the year through the successful 
acquisition and integration of a number of 
small plumbing businesses and as at the end 
of the year, over 80% of all plumbing jobs were 
being carried out by our network of 285 directly 
employed plumbers. increasing the proportion of 
work carried out by our own engineers will enable 
us to deliver enhanced customer service together 
with productivity gains and to steadily reduce 
the average cost per job. h aving completed the 
franchising of our electrics and g as networks 
we have now started to franchise our plumbing 
network in remote parts of the UK thereby further 
increasing the number of h omeserve branded 
vehicles and engineers in the network. in addition, 
we continue to invest in systems that support 
our network to improve customer service and 
operational efficiency. 
o ur expectations for the UK business for the 
coming year are to build on the success we have 
had this year with the delivery of further customer 
growth of 3–4% and up to a 1 percentage point 
reduction in the retention rate.

 result for Spain of £0.4m (2009: 
£0.1m) reflects the reinvestment of profits from our 
claims handling business in the development of 
our Spanish policy business where we continue to 
make good progress. In the 12 months to March 
2010, the number of policies nearly doubled to 
94,000 (2009: 48,000) following an encouraging 
start to full scale marketing with Endesa and 
against a backdrop of an extremely tough 
economic environment. 
In February, we announced a significant 
development for our Spanish business with the 
signing of a long-term marketing agreement 
with agbar, Spain’s largest water company 
with over 4 million residential customers. The 
agreement represents an important step for 
our Spanish business enabling us to launch full

 of

and an increase in customer numbers of 31% to

t he retention rate has also increased to 82.6% 
(2009: 80.0%) as a result of a greater proportion 
of customers paying for their policies via their 
utility bill and the success of “easi-pay” which 
encourages cheque paying customers to switch 
to continuous payment. 
policy growth in the Us has been driven by strong 
take-ups with our new gas affinity partners

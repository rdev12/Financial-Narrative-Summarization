 14 TNS annual report 2002
2002 results
I believe our results for 2002 represent a creditable
performance and indicate that our strategy will deliver
longer-term returns for our shareholders. In order to be in a
position to deliver those returns when the markets in which
we operate recover, we continued to invest in developments
aligned with our strategic aims, while taking a rigorous
approach to costs during the year.
During 2002, the group’s reported turnover including joint
ventures increased by 6.2 per cent to £618.9 million 
(2001 £582.7 million). This includes acquisitions made
during the year to strengthen the group’s position in the US
market and Media Intelligence sector and reinforce its online
research capabilities, as well as to extend its operations into
Sweden and Greece. Underlying growth, excluding the
effect of currency, acquisitions and operations discontinued
during the year, was 0.5 per cent. Turnover excluding joint
ventures was £603.2 million (2001 £575.1 million).
Operating profit including joint ventures and before
goodwill charges was up 8.3 per cent to £59.8 million 
(2001 £55.2 million). During the year, the group continued
to focus on cost control and reviewed the viability of both
lower-margin contracts and lower-performing businesses. 
The latter led to the closure of certain operations, the cost of
which held back the degree of margin growth for the year.
However the other actions taken, together with progressing
the business mix to 50 per cent syndicated/continuous 
and 50 per cent ad hoc customised, contributed to an
improvement in operating margin before goodwill charges
to 9.7 per cent (2001 9.5 per cent). Group operating profit
before joint ventures and after goodwill charges fell by 5.4
per cent to £38.3 million (2001 £40.5 million). 
Profit before tax and goodwill charges grew by 12.2 per cent
to £48.8 million (2001 £43.5 million). Goodwill charges of
£20.2 million (2001 £13.9 million) comprise amortisation of
£13.9 million (2001 £9.0 million) and impairments of 
£6.3  million (2001 £4.9 million). Given the ongoing
uncertainty over the section of the US telecoms market in
which Indetec operates, the goodwill carrying value of
£4.3m has been written off. The balance of the impairment
relates to Tellex, reflecting the current difficult trading
environment for media intelligence companies in the UK.
Profit before tax and after goodwill charges decreased by 
3.4 per cent to £28.6 million (£29.6 million).
Adjusted earnings per share before goodwill charges were
8.6p, an increase of 7.5 per cent (2001 8.0p). Basic earnings
per share fell by 23.3 per cent to 3.3p (2001 4.3p). The board
is recommending a final dividend of 1.7p per share 
(2001 1.6p), giving an 8.3 per cent increase in the total
dividend for the year of 2.6p (2001 2.4p).
Board developments
During 2002, we were pleased to welcome two new non-
executive directors to the group. Rob Rowley, previously
Finance Director of Reuters Group PLC, joined the board in
September. He brings significant business and finance
experience, together with a broad understanding of the
information industry, all of which are highly relevant to our
operations. He was nominated senior independent director
with effect from the start of this year.
Rémy Sautter became a non-executive director in November
2002. He is Chairman of Channel 5 and RTL Radio. His
extensive experience in international media and with French
business and financial institutions will be of great value to
us, as we continue to develop and grow the company. 
At the end of 2002, Deputy Chairman Nick Hodges retired
from the board. Nick joined us as a non-executive director at
the time of the Sofres merger in 1997, which transformed the
group into a world leader. With his highly-developed
understanding of the commercial world, he made a
Chairman’s statement
In a year when our clients’ marketing budgets were under severe pressure, TNS increased
both profit before goodwill and turnover, to become the world’s third largest market
information company in terms of revenue.

significant contribution to the board’s deliberations and
decisions. Jacques-Henri David, who had been a non-
executive director since 1998, left the board on 31 January
2003. His international business experience has been very
useful to us as we developed our global network. 
On behalf of shareholders, I thank these directors for their
valuable input and, on a personal level, I am most grateful
for the advice and support they have given to me.
Reinforcing the group’s position
Over the past few years, we have built the group into one of
the world’s strongest forces in market information and TNS
now operates increasingly as one company with a global
presence. Our new branding reinforces this positioning and
emphasises the power and coherence of our network,
reflecting our ability to develop key account relationships
with our multi-national clients. It also supports the greater
focus we are placing on added value and advisory services. 
Recognising our people 
As a global leader, we are attracting into the group high
calibre people, those with ambitions to work in one of the
industry’s top companies. This includes people with
particular expertise in our specialist sectors, as well as
market information professionals. They, like those already
working with us, are people with the drive, skills and
ambition to exploit the group’s significant potential to 
the full. 
By increasing our focus on training and development, 
we ensure that these skills are further advanced. TNS
University, Finance in Business, Managing People and
Performance are just some of the many training programmes
that we have developed to build and strengthen the quality
of our teams. Over the past year, we have seen a number of
the younger managers from within the group move up into
the top position in their operations. 
As our people develop, so do our reward systems and we are
extending the use of performance-driven incentives, to align
the interests of senior management closely with those of
shareholders. 
As I write this, we are living in a time of great political and
economic uncertainty. Such times are difficult ones in which
to operate but I am constantly reassured by the sheer hard
work and dedication shown by my 9,000 colleagues around
the world. On behalf of shareholders, I thank them for all
that they have done and continue to do.

annual report and accounts in which the
Board is pleased to report a strong set of
full year figures. Turnover , profit before
exceptional items and cash generated
from operations are all ahead of the prior
year , and continue the progress presented
in our interim statement.
Following the reverse takeover in
September 2008, the integration of 
the two businesses was successfully
completed and support functions
consolidated. In addition, certain
rebranding has taken place and a number
of new products and initiatives launched.
The Group has achieved some significant
contract wins from the competition and
this momentum has continued into the
new financial year . Despite the beginning
of a recession in the UK and continued
difficult operating conditions for the pub
and club market the Group has continued
to grow by increasing market share, and
the Board’s strategy is to continue this
through a combination of organic growth
and acquisition.
The banking crisis resulted in the
termination of some of our leasing
facilities during the year . While this placed
an absolute limit on the number of new
contracts we could accept, the raising of
£5.5m of new equity in June 2009 has
enabled the expansion to continue. 
We have also secured a number of new
asset finance lines since the year end,
which have been utilised to fund recent
capital purchases.
I am convinced that we have the best
executive senior management team in the
business and this will continue to be very
important to the future of the Group.
Finally, I would like to thank the
management and staff of our trading
divisions for their commitment and 
hard work over the past 12 months. 
Our reputation for customer service 
and operational innovation is built on 
their contributions, and I am sure that 
the Board can rely on their continued
support in the months ahead.

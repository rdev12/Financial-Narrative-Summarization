MEXICO FACILITY RE-OPENS
Following a fire at our Mexican 
Aerospace facility in October 2014, 
much of 2015 was focused on getting 
this factory back on track. Thanks to the 
efforts of our team in Mexico, the first 
customer delivery was made two 
weeks after the incident, while still 
operating in a much reduced capacity. 
New equipment arrived during the first 
half of 2015 and following extensive 
building work, the building was 
re-opened in October 2015.
THE GROUP OPENS FOUR  
NEW FACILITIES
In February 2015, the Group opened a 
new 39,000 sq. ft. facility within close 
proximity to Boeing South Carolina, 
which will operate as an extension to 
Senior Aerospace AMT. The first phase 
of expansion into a new 196,000 sq. ft. 
factory in Thailand was completed during 
the year and phase two construction is 
well underway. At SSP, the construction 
of a new additional 59,000 sq. ft. 
production facility was completed during 
the year. The Group has opened a new 
26,000 sq. ft. facility in India to support 
the manufacture of EGR coolers for a 
blue-chip customer. 
CDP A LIST
We were pleased to report this year that 
the Group’s environmental improvements 
were recognised for the depth and 
quality of climate change data it has 
disclosed to investors and the global 
marketplace through CDP, the 
international NGO, formerly known as 
the Carbon Disclosure Project that drives 
sustainable economies. Senior’s efforts 
were recognised when it was included 
in CDP’s Climate A List. The Leadership 
Index highlights companies providing 
a high level of transparency in their 
disclosure of climate-related information.

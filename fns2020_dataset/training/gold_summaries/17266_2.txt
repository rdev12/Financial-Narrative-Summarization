Highlights
Generated like-for-like 
growth
During the year the Group 
generated revenue of £13,558 
million (2009/10: £13,203 million). 
This was 5 per cent ahead of 
last year on a like-for-like basis 
including strong growth in the USA.
Despite a weak economic climate, a return to like-for-like 
growth, together with a continuing focus on improving 
customer service, cash generation, cost reduction and 
margin protection have produced a strong set of results.

Improved gross margin
We want each of our business 
units to make incremental 
improvements in gross margin 
every year. In 2010/11, in tough 
markets the Group’s gross margin 
improved by 0.2 per cent to 27.9 
per cent (2009/10: 27.7 per cent).
Improved customer 
service
A key objective for each business 
unit is to improve customer service. 
Processes for tracking and 
reporting monthly customer service 
data by branch are now in place in 
every business unit. This is helping 
us drive further improvements in 
our businesses.
Gained market share
Our objective for each business 
unit is to increase market share 
every year. In 2010/11, three 
quarters of our business units 
held or improved market share.
Rationalised portfolio
During the year we announced our 
plans to exit ﬁve underperforming 
business units. The signiﬁcant 
business disposals planned 
following last year’s strategic review 
is now largely complete. This will 
allow us to focus our resources on 
our strategically strong businesses 
going forward.
Reinstated dividend
In March we reinstated ordinary 
dividends reﬂecting the strength 
of the balance sheet and our 
conﬁdence in the future trading 
prospects of the Group. The total 
dividend for 2010/11 was 45 pence 
per share.

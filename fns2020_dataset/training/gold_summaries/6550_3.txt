 2George Wimpey Plc Annual Report 2003
continuing the organic
growth of Morrison Homes 
achieving industry leading
standards of quality and
customer satisfaction
The Chief Executive’s Report
sets out on pages 4-6 how we
will develop these strategies
further this year to ensure we
continue to deliver the long
term growth that we aim for.
Group Results
Building on the outstanding
results in 2002, the Group’s
performance has yet again seen
substantial further progress in
2003. Group turnover rose by
11% to £2,879 million and, on
the back of sharply improved
margins, Group proﬁt before tax
and exceptionals rose by 30% to
£378 million. Earnings per share
rose by 31% to 68.5p per share.
As we announced at the 
time of our Interim results 
in July, the Board has adopted
a strategy of enhanced
dividend growth.This reﬂects
the conﬁdence we have that
the underlying performance 
of our Company has been
fundamentally transformed.
Over time, we will look to
reduce the currently high 
level of dividend cover, but 
at the same time ensure we
maintain a prudent balance
sheet.The Board is therefore
recommending an increase 
Three years ago I wrote 
“We are in the process of
creating a new Company 
with renewed emphasis 
on shareholder value” .
Since writing the 2000 Annual
Report we have transformed
the structure of our business,
our financial results have
improved to be amongst 
the best in our sector and we
have consistently delivered
industry leading growth 
in earnings and returns for 
our shareholders.
This year, we have achieved
that success and created 
a strong business through
implementing the four 
distinct strategies, set out in 
last year’s Annual Report:
increasing margins in our
core UK business
developing our premium
business, Laing Homes
in the ﬁnal dividend of 43% to
8.45 pence per share, bringing
the total for the year to 12.25
pence, a rise of 35% on 2002.
The dividend cover has been
reduced to 5.6 times, providing
the capacity for the Board 
to increase dividends at a
somewhat faster rate than
earnings in the coming years,
if that is appropriate.
The Board
During the year the Board 
has continued to play an 
active and supportive role in
our operational businesses.
We continue to place great
importance on ensuring we
have a balance of knowledge
and experience and that this
meets the requirements of 
our operating companies.
In October, we welcomed
Brenda Dean, Baroness Dean 
of Thornton-le-Fylde, as a 
Non Executive Director. Brenda
is an active member of the
House of Lords and brings
considerable knowledge 
of the public sector to 
the Board at a time when
Government has an 
increasing impact on our
business. Brenda retired 
as Chairman of the Housing
Corporation during 2003,
a position which has given 
her a wealth of knowledge
which will be of value to 
the Company.
Achieving real leadership 
in our sector
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
JOHN ROBINSON George Wimpey Plc Annual Report 2003 3
During 2003 we have 
further developed our
commitment to Corporate
Social Responsibility and
sustainability. We established 
a new CSR Board Committee,
chaired by Christine Cross.
The Committee met twice
during the second half of 
2003 and will establish,
monitor and review CSR
activities to ensure that our
businesses are constantly
working to improve their
performance in this area.
A separate CSR Report has
again been published to
accompany this Annual
Report. It sets out in detail 
our CSR activities and reports
on the targets identified 
last year for the key areas 
of impact of our business.
Government
During the year the
Government has introduced 
In October we also announced
that Keith Cushen would be
retiring from the Board at the
end of 2003. Keith has played
a major role in the trans-
formation of this business over
the past three years. On behalf
of the Board I would like 
to express our thanks and
appreciation for the enormous
contribution he has made to
George Wimpey in his almost
20 years of service at local,
national and Board level.
Corporate Governance and
Corporate Social Responsibility
We aim to achieve the highest
standards of corporate
governance and once again,
I am pleased to report that the
Board operated throughout
the year in full compliance
with the Combined Code 
on Corporate Governance.
The Board has reviewed the
new Combined Code which
applies to listed companies with
reporting years commencing
on or after 1 November 2003.
We feel that we already 
operate in substantial
compliance with the new 
Code but, following a review,
new procedures and changes
have been implemented.We
have included a number of
additional disclosures in this
Report that the new Code 
does not require to be made
until our 2004 Report.
several initiatives that aim 
to improve the supply of
housing and create a more
stable housing environment.
We welcome these initiatives 
and have taken part in the
consultation processes that 
are aimed at ensuring a
constructive debate on
housing.We are all too aware
that Government policy can
have consequences other 
than those intended, and will
respond directly to policy
statements, as well as through
the Housebuilders Federation
and the CBI.
Employees 
During this year I have been
fortunate to spend a greater
amount of time in our regional
businesses in both the UK and
the US, meeting employees
out on our sites and in our
ofﬁces. I am always impressed
by the pride they have in 
their businesses and their
continuing dedication 
and enthusiasm to ensure
George Wimpey is truly
successful. Once again, on
behalf of the Board I am
delighted to be able to thank
them for all their hard work.
Outlook
Across our businesses we
entered 2004 with strong
order books and our 
markets in the UK and the 
US remain healthy.
Our continuing focus on 
costs and emphasis on 
buying land on improved
terms is aimed at sustaining
the improvement we have
made in our operating
margins. We have a strong
business and have developed
our strategy seeking to 
deliver continuous proﬁt
growth based on our existing
strengths and not by relying 
on external conditions.
The Board is conﬁdent 
that George Wimpey will
continue to make further
progress in 2004.

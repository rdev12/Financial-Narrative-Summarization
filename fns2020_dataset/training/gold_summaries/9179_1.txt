 Kleeneze Annual Report 2005 | 7
Chief Executive’s Review
In order to reflect the re-shaping of the
Group into a home shopping specialist
selling through three channels: Catalogue
Home Shopping, Internet Retailing and
Television Shopping, I am setting out 
my Chief Executive’s Review for these
divisions as follows:
Catalogue Home Shopping
The Catalogue Home Shopping division
comprises Kleeneze Europe and Farepak. 
Kleeneze Europe
Kleeneze Europe provides good value,
everyday products through a range of
catalogues delivered direct to the home 
by self-employed distributors covering 
the UK, Ireland and the Netherlands.
Turnover at Kleeneze Europe grew 7.6% 
to £88.9 million (2004: £82.6 million) 
and the UK and Ireland grew by 6.4% 
to £87.9 million (2004: £82.6 million).
Operating profit before exceptional 
items was up 12.1% to £7.4 million 
(2004: £6.6 million). 
The number of distributors at the year 
end in the UK and Ireland rose slightly 
to 13,524 (2004: 13,397) as we reversed
the downward trend seen over the last 
18 months. The effort that we have put into
improving the retention rates of distributors
has started to have a positive effect on 
the distributor base. These efforts are
continuing into the new year as we are
providing more training and support.
In October 2004 we successfully launched
Kleeneze Europe in the Netherlands and 
at the year end we had 2,000 distributors.
The catalogues and range of products have
been well received by the Dutch consumers
and we have already issued our third
catalogue, with two more planned for 
the remainder of this year. Before the
exceptional charge of £0.5 million reflecting
the write-off of the start-up costs, the Dutch
business was profitable. This is an excellent
start to our new continental European
business and we are on track to expand
our operations further later this year.
In September 2004 we acquired the 
assets and trademarks of Cabouchon for
£0.4 million in cash. We have re-launched
the brand with a new catalogue updating
the product range. This should re-stimulate
interest in the brand and drive recruitment
of consultants, which had slowed down 
at the end of last year. Although the brand
and the network remain separate, we have
integrated the operations with those of
Kleeneze Europe.
During the year Kleeneze Europe and its
distributors raised £3,000 for Macmillan
Cancer Relief and £30,000 for the Tsunami
Disaster Committee Appeal.
We have improved the operating margin 
at Kleeneze Europe to 8.3% (2004: 8.0%),
primarily due to the first full year of
efficiencies from the new distribution
centre. This improvement in margin was
achieved despite significant increases 
in distribution costs, which prevented a
larger improvement. The efficiencies should
continue to increase and we expect to see
further improvements in margin in the
current year.
Kleeneze Europe continues to be a
dynamic business, which has grown 
year on year despite poor retailing
conditions in the UK. We have launched
successfully in continental Europe and 
the potential of the European market 
is enormous. We have the capacity 
to increase our turnover significantly 
in the UK and intend to distribute from
continental Europe in the near future.
2005 has seen the Group make significant
progress towards becoming a leading European
home shopping specialist. 
Kim Rawson
Deputy Managing Director
Kleeneze Europe
“This has been a particularly exciting 
year for Kleeneze Europe, and we 
are all very focused on maximising 
the potential from our market expansion 
in the UK, Republic of Ireland and 
the Netherlands. Our distributors remain 
key to that development.”

Chief Executive’s Review continued
Farepak
Farepak sells Christmas hampers, gifts
and shopping vouchers on a monthly
instalment basis through catalogues
distributed by independent agents across
the UK. Farepak operates two brands,
Farepak and Home Farm, which is 60%
owned by Findel plc.
Turnover at Farepak grew by 7.1% to 
£81.7 million (2004: £76.3 million) but
operating profit before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items fell to £0.2 million 
(2004: £1.3 million).
The year was very difficult for Farepak 
as agent numbers fell 6% to 55,931 
(2004: 59,429) and, more importantly,
the number of hampers sold, as opposed 
to shopping vouchers, fell by 16%. 
As a result of this decline, which has
accelerated in the current year, we have
closed the production of hampers at
Farepak and agreed a three-year contract
with FHSC Limited, another Christmas
hamper company, under which they will
produce all of our Christmas savings club
hampers. This will reduce our fixed costs
significantly and allow us to react more
flexibly to further declines in hamper
volumes. We had to make 34 people
redundant and these redundancies,
together with other one-off costs, have
resulted in the exceptional charges 
of £0.5 million. We continue to examine 
the way in which we operate to react 
to the changes in the market place.
The ongoing decline in hamper volumes 
has resulted in shopping vouchers now
representing 80% (2004: 76%) of total
turnover. This is a trend that has been seen
over the last five years and will continue 
in the future. 
To take advantage of this trend we
launched a new voucher-only offering,
Freedom, which has the widest range of
shopping vouchers in the market place and
is aimed at a younger market than our
traditional Farepak customers. Although 
it is early days, we are pleased with the
response rate in the first year. We have 
also started a third party voucher operation
providing vouchers for businesses 
and charities.
Farepak employees are still proud to be
supporting Macmillan Cancer Relief and to
date more than £16,500 has been raised
through Agent donations and staff activities. 
Farepak was also pleased to give assistance 
in the aftermath of the Tsunami disaster 
at the end of 2004 and was able to offer
much needed packaging to local volunteer
aid organisations who were collecting 
and dispatching vital supplies to the
stricken areas. 
As we have said before, the Christmas
hamper market is in decline as customers
are changing the way in which they shop for
Christmas. Savings clubs are, however, still
popular as people become more concerned
about their own levels of personal debt, but
any future growth in the market as a whole
will only come from low margin shopping
voucher sales. The closure of hamper
production will significantly de-risk the
business in the future and allow us to 
focus more on growing our shopping
voucher operation.

Farepak sorted and dispatched over 400,000
gift vouchers on 19th October 2004
Nicholas Gilodi-Johnson
Managing Director
Farepak
“We have embraced the migration of sales
from hampers to lower margin shopping
vouchers by launching Freedom, a new
catalogue which offers our customers the
widest range of vouchers available in the
market. Freedom represents an exciting
growth opportunity for us to target a 
younger audience new to the savings club
market, thereby enabling us to expand our
customer base.” “The vouchers I saved
for helped me give 
my family a Christmas
to remember.”

Internet Retailing
The Internet Retailing division comprises 
the recent acquisitions, IWOOT and Kitbag. 
IWOOT
IWOOT is the market leading internet
business selling a wide range of gifts 
and gadgets from its award-winning
website www.iwantoneofthose.com.  
Turnover for the six months post acquisition
was £4.7 million with an operating loss
before goodwill amortisation of £0.1 million.
We acquired IWOOT on 25th October
2004. Since acquisition we have
increased the product range on the
website by over 25% from 409 to 515
products at the end of April. The most
popular products over the last six months
have included Aurora Mood Clocks and
Phlat Balls, illustrating the wide range of
appeal of our products. IWOOT had its
most successful Christmas in its history 
and during the busiest week the website
handled 324,000 visitors with a
conversion rate of 6%. We are building 
on that success and turnover in the last
quarter of the year was up 80% on the
previous year, although the conversion 
rate has fallen, as expected, from the
seasonal peak.
We are improving the ways in which 
we communicate with our customers 
and as a result we have increased 
our customer database by 30%. A key
contributor to the increased database is
our high levels of service with guaranteed
next day delivery if products are ordered
before 5pm. We have also reviewed our
email campaigns with customers and
published a number of catalogues to
complement our online service. We are
improving the effectiveness of our website
adding increased functionality to the 
site such as the addition of a reminder
service for birthdays.
During the year we have seen significant
growth within our corporate sales
establishing working partnerships with 
a number of blue chip companies.
Established partnerships include
lastminute.com where we provide third
party products and fulfilment for their
website offering.
We have started the process of integrating
IWOOT into the Group and are increasing
the number of products sourced from 
the Far East using Kleeneze Europe’s
expertise. There will be further integration
of back office services during the
remainder of this year.
The cross-fertilisation of products has
already started and we have sold various
IWOOT products both on eeZee tv, during a
dedicated IWOOT hour, and through Kleeneze
Europe. In June this year we launched our
first Gifts and Gadgets flyer for the Kleeneze
Europe network and the initial reaction was
positive. We are planning another Gifts and
Gadgets catalogue for Christmas. We have
also introduced various cross-promotional
activities with Kitbag.
IWOOT is one of the leading internet
retailers in the fastest growing area of the
UK’s retail sector. We will continue to invest
in IWOOT to drive the business forward
more quickly and ensure that we can
develop more products for use across 
the Group.

Chief Executive’s Review continued
David Booth
Managing Director
IWOOT
“IWOOT continues to develop into one of 
the major brands on the internet high street
having gained the number one position for 
gifts and flowers over the Christmas period.
The purchase by Kleeneze has now opened
up new and exciting opportunities which
will deliver significant growth and cost
savings in the current year.” 12 | Kleeneze Annual Report 2005
Kitbag
Kitbag is the leading internet sports and
leisure wear retailer. As well as selling all
major branded products and its own branded
product on its website www.kitbag.com,
Kitbag also runs online and catalogue
retailing for major football clubs.
Turnover for the one month post acquisition
was £0.5 million and there was a small
operating loss.
We acquired Kitbag on 1st April 2005. 
We have already made progress with the
integration of the back office services 
and the call centre is now being managed
and run by Kleeneze Europe. As well as
reducing costs this will also enhance
Kitbag’s offering as the Kleeneze Europe
service centre is open 24 hours a day,
seven days a week. This should increase
Kitbag’s sales both in the UK and, more
importantly, in the USA where we already
have a small presence.
We are working closely with our major
football club partners, Manchester United,
Chelsea and Barcelona, in preparation for
new kit launches later this year. We expect
to see the 2005/06 season kit launches
perform well. Chelsea have a new Home 
kit launch in their Centenary year as
Premiership champions, Barcelona have
new Home and Away shirts as La Liga
winners and Manchester United have 
a new Away shirt. Kitbag holds long term
contracts with all of its major football club
partners. We have recently entered into a
five-year contract with Celtic FC to provide
the official website store and all fulfilment
services. Kitbag produces catalogues as
well as a variety of other direct mail pieces
to support the online activity of each of the
clubs. A catalogue will shortly be produced
to support the Kitbag website.
We have also won an 18-month contract
with Nike to manage the e-commerce
activities on their football website,
www.nikefootball.com, across Europe. 
This contract takes us beyond the next
football World Cup, which will be held 
in Germany in the summer of 2006. 
The site went live in July 2005 and it 
has started well.
We have also established a series of
partnership programmes with leading
retailers including American Express Cards,
where we are the exclusive online sports
retailing partner, Lucozade and Gillette.
We have run several successful hours 
on eeZee tv selling a variety of football 
kits and memorabilia and are planning a
catalogue for the Kleeneze Europe network
in September this year.
As with IWOOT, high levels of service 
are very important to Kitbag and we 
also offer a guaranteed next day delivery
service for all products ordered before
3pm. We enhance the quality of the 
service by offering unique bespoke services
such as shirt naming and numbering and
embroidering of football boots.
Kitbag is a well-respected internet 
retailer operating in a growing part of 
the sports apparel market. The win of the
pan-European Nike football website gives 
us a presence in continental Europe which
opens up a new market. We will continue 
to bid for major football club contracts and
work with the leading brands to build the
business across Europe.

Television Shopping
eeZee tv
eeZee tv is a joint venture broadcasting live
for 14 hours per day on the Sky platform
channel 659 as well as streamed live over
the internet on www.eezeetv.com. eeZee tv
sells a wide range of products across six
major product ranges at a discount to High
Street prices.
In the seven months since we launched 
the joint venture our share of turnover was
£0.3 million and our share of the operating
losses was £0.8 million. Additionally we
have incurred £0.3 million of start-up costs.
We founded the 50/50 joint venture 
with John Mills Limited (“JML”) on 
29th September 2004 and started 
live broadcasting on 1st March 2005. 
We formed the joint venture with JML 
to combine their product sourcing and
broadcasting expertise with our operational
expertise and all of the products are
dispatched from Kleeneze Europe’s
distribution centre.
eeZee tv should become a new part of our
product sourcing over the next few years
as we will be using television to test new
products for our catalogues. A product that
sells well on television will be migrated 
into our Kleeneze Europe catalogues. 
We are also selling other Group products
on television.
We are using JML’s position as an
advertiser on terrestrial and satellite
television to promote eeZee tv. JML also
has over 4,000 video promotion units 
in major retailers across the UK, such as
B&Q, Woolworths and Boots and we are
using this presence to promote eeZee tv 
as well as promoting it in our Kleeneze
Europe catalogues. These cross promotions
should drive viewers to our station in 
a targeted and cost-effective manner. 
On 1st July 2005 we launched a new
series of daily specials, the “Big eeZee”
and we are continuing this initiative across
the summer into the Christmas period.
We broadcast our programmes
simultaneously on our website, eezeetv.com,
which already accounts for some 15% of our
turnover with a conversion rate of over 5%. 
We have launched a “Kleeneze show” 
on eeZee tv at 8am on Saturday mornings
with shows repeated at 8am on Wednesday
mornings. This is designed to enhance the
profile and reputation of Kleeneze Europe
and bring it to the attention of a wider
audience. We are planning to broadcast
these shows throughout the year.
eeZee tv provides us with an opportunity 
to develop a presence in television shopping
and extend our product development 
and sourcing.

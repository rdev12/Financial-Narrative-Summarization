Chief Executive’ s review
The solid performance of our core products and the successful 
development of new products demonstrates the ability of the 
business to adapt to the changing market environment.

INTRODUCTION
H&T have traded well in a challenging market having stabilised our core 
pawnbroking business whilst also developing our other revenue lines.  
Profit before tax for the year increased to £6.8m (2014: £5.5m), an 
increase of 23.6%, principally as a result of growth in Personal Loans  
and Other Services.
Our store estate of 189 stores comprises 150 H&T Pawnbrokers stores  
and 39 est1897 second hand jewellery retail stores. During the year we 
have closed two underperforming H&T Pawnbrokers stores. In light of  
the current trading environment a small number of stores are expected  
to close during 2016.
The Group’s development of Personal Loans, Buyback and FX supports the 
evolution of our business model to products with higher growth whilst 
also reducing our exposure to fluctuations in the gold price. The Group’s 
online development continues with the implementation of a new mobile 
optimised website, new branding and a simpler customer journey. This 
activity has resulted in an improvement in website traffic and the online 
Personal Loans book in H2 2015.
THE MARKET
The high street alternative credit market is changing. We estimate that 
around one third of outlets operated by the major groups have closed 
since December 2013 as a result of the lower gold price and the higher 
standards required by the FCA.
The average gold price in 2015 was £759 per troy oz (2014: £768), a fall 
of 1.2% although the monthly averages ranged from a high of £825 in 
January 2015 to a low of £712 in December 2015. This reduction during 
the course of the year compressed the margins realised from purchasing 
scrap in particular.
The cost cap on pay day lending was implemented on 2 January 2015 and 
as expected this led to closures among our high street competitors.
The cost cap has also assisted our online development as the fees paid 
to brokers have reduced to a level where we can now acquire leads in a 
more cost effective way. This has helped the development of the online 
Personal Loan book to £0.3m at 31 December 2015 (2014: £0.1m), with 
the growth taking place during H2 2015.
The Group has managed external risks effectively and our financial stability, 
range of products and outstanding service delivery position us to take 
advantage of these changing market conditions.

OUR STRATEGY
The Group’s strategy is to serve a customer base whose access to 
mainstream credit is limited and for whom small sum loans can help get 
through short term financial challenges. The Group will continue to deliver 
this strategy by developing a range of lending products, both secured and 
unsecured, offered in-store and online.
The development of a strong retail proposition supports our lending and 
purchasing operations, improves returns and reduces the Groups exposure 
to gold price volatility. The continuing development of the est1897 brand 
could play an important part of this strategy in the future.  
REGULATION
THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY
The regulation of Consumer Credit moved from the Office of Fair Trading 
(OFT) to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on 1 April 2014. The 
Group obtained authorisation from the FCA on 11 February 2016 and we 
welcome the higher standards that this change will bring to our sector.
The Group has appointed a head of compliance and established a risk 
committee comprised of independent Non-Executive Directors to oversee 
the Group’s compliance framework. Our Non-Executive Directors have 
extensive experience with the regulatory requirements of the FCA and its 
predecessors and provide the Group with valuable support and insight into 
the new regime.
HIGH COST SHORT TERM CREDIT INTEREST RATE CAP
On 2 January 2015 the cost cap on the interest rate and charges that apply 
to high-cost short-term credit (HCSTC) came into effect. They are:
•	 	 a 	 maximum 	 charge 	 of 	 0.8% 	 per 	 day 	 on 	 the 	 amount 	 borr owed
•	 	 a 	 maximum 	 of 	 £15 	 fees 	 on 	 default
•	 	 a 	 cap 	 on 	 the 	 total 	 costs 	 incurr ed 	 over 	 the 	 li fe 	 of 	 the 	 loan 	 of 	 100% 	 of	
the amount borrowed
The definition of HCSTC is broad but provides a specific exemption for 
pawnbroking and certain other credit products at present.
The Group is well positioned for the new regulatory environment both in 
terms of our detailed preparation and the range of products we offer.
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
The Group’s total gross profits increased to £47.5m (2014: £45.7m) 
principally as a result of the improvements in the Pawnbroking Scrap, 
Personal Loans and Other Services segments.
The development in Personal Loans and Other Services is encouraging as 
we establish these high growth products in the store estate, collectively 
generating an additional £1.8m of gross profits in the year.
PAWNBROKING
The pledge book has increased 1.3% to £39.0m (2014: £38.5m). During 
the year the Group has focussed on enabling our staff to make sound 
lending decisions to maximise the potential in the market whilst managing 
financial risk.
The Group’s Pawn Service Charge was unchanged at £28.4m (2014: 
£28.4m) and now represents 59.9% of Group gross profit (2014: 62.1%). 
 
The yield on the pledge book has improved to 73.4% (2014: 68.8%) as a 
result of the improvements in redemption delivered over recent years. The 
average monthly redemption of loans issued in 2012 was 75.6%, this has 
increased to 82.0% for loans issued in 2014 as a result of our high quality 
lending decisions, customer communication and, where appropriate, 
assisting customers into repayment plans for pawnbroking loans. The early 
redemption performance of loans issued in 2015 leads us to expect further 
improvements during the course of the year.
Total lending in 2015 increased 3.9% to £98.2m (2014: £94.5m), the 
average lending rate per gram being in line with 2014.
The Group implemented a number of initiatives during the year to support 
the pawnbroking proposition:

1)  Continued development of “Expert Eye”, a system which enables high 
definition magnified images to be sent from a store to our centre of 
excellence at the jewellery centre where the images are assessed and 
with telephone support the store is able to make a better loan decision
2)  Relaunch of the online pawnbroking system to simplify the customer 
journey via the “We lend on anything” valuation portal and interaction 
with the “Expert Eye” valuation service
3)  The development of the website to deliver a mobile optimised 
application process
The Group remains focussed on pawnbroking as the largest contributor to 
gross profits. Our continued delivery of excellent customer service and high 
quality lending decisions on a wide range of assets positions us well in this 
evolving market.
PAWNBROKING SCRAP
Pawnbroking Scrap produced a profit in the year of £0.1m (2014: £0.2m loss).
This result was expected given the relative stability in average gold prices 
between 2014 and 2015. We would not expect margins on pawnbroking 
scrap to return to historical levels as we seek to maintain a competitive 
proposition on lending and support the pledge book.
RETAIL
Retail sales decreased 4.5% to £29.5m (2014: £30.9m) and gross profit 
decreased 3.7% to £10.3m (2014: £10.7m). On a like for like basis direct 
margin from retail improved 1.3% with the growth coming from the 
est1897 retail focussed stores. Retail sales are stated net of margin scheme 
VAT payable, the cost of which increased in the year by an estimated 
£0.7m principally as a result of reduction in retail stocks.
The Group considers a successful retail offering to be a core part of our 
Group proposition. Pawnbroking and Gold Purchasing generate significant 
amounts of saleable jewellery which must be sold. While higher historic 
gold prices provided a reasonable return from scrapping gold, this 
disposition route is not suitable for gemset items or watches. The ability to 
sell items rather than scrap them also provides a higher return and reduces 
the Group’s exposure to short term gold price volatility.
The three standalone Discount Secondhand Jewellery stores have provided 
a useful forum to test and develop new inventory lines and display 
techniques although they have yet to provide a meaningful contribution. 
The 36 rebranded Discount Secondhand Jewellery stores have 
outperformed the core estate, delivering growth in direct retail margin of 
5.8% year on year. The Group has completed a number of trials during the 
year to ascertain the correct balance between lending and retail activities in 
these stores and we expect further improvement in the future.
GOLD PURCHASING
During the year the average gold price fell from a high of £825 in January 
2015 to a low of £712 in December 2015, the average for the year was 
£759 (2014: £768), a fall of 1.2%. This reduction during the course of the 
year reduces the margin realised from purchasing scrap and is the principal 
reason for the reduction in gross profits from purchasing to £2.3m (2014: 
£2.4m), a fall of 4.2%.
Following several years of decline the market for gold purchasing is now 
finding a new level. This stabilisation has allowed a focus on improving 
margins during H2 2015 which, while improving gross profits, has in turn 
resulted in a reduction in volumes during H2 2015. We estimate that the 
weight of fine gold purchased has reduced approximately 7.1% between 
2014 and 2015.

Chief Executive’ s review (continued)
PERSONAL LOANS
Personal Loans gross profits increased 33.3% to £2.4m (2014: £1.8m);  
the loanbook net of provisions at 31 December 2015 was £4.2m  
(31 December 2014: £3.1m), an increase of 35.5%. The yield on the 
average monthly loanbook was 68.0% (2014: 69.5%), the slight  
reduction caused by the growth in the new customer numbers and 
development of the online product.
The Group considers the development of the Personal Loan product 
in-store and online to be a significant opportunity. H&T’s personal loan 
product allows for loans of up to £2,000 over any term of up to two 
years based on affordability. Approximately 80% of the loans issued by 
the Group fell under the definition of high-cost short-term credit (HCSTC) 
during 2015 and as such must comply with additional rules under the new 
FCA regulatory regime.
The Group has positioned the product to be cheaper and more flexible 
than most comparable loans in the market and has applied robust 
affordability assessments including a manual review of each loan 
application. The Group intends to reduce the proportion of HCSTC loans 
over time as we develop lower cost, longer term loans for our customers.
We expect the in-store focus, new website, improved search engine 
optimisation, digital marketing and our presence on price comparison 
websites to increase volumes during 2016.
OTHER SERVICES
The Other Services segment has increased 44.4% to £3.9m (2014: £2.7m) 
principally as a result of the improvements in the recently introduced FX 
and Buyback products.
Buyback has been a particular success as part of the “We buy anything” 
proposition as the value purchased increased from £2.9m in 2014 to 
£6.0m in 2015. This improvement was achieved through simplification 
of the in-store valuation process using a new computer system and a 
measured extension to the assets accepted.
FX also continues to grow with gross profits increasing by 75.0% from 
£0.8m to £1.4m as the product becomes more established in the business.
Our continued investment in systems, training and store level point of sale 
materials will provide further growth as we establish these rapidly growing 
products in the business.
PROSPECTS
The demand for small sum, short term cash loans remains strong and by 
increasing the range of assets it accepts, by expanding Personal Loans 
and Other Services both in-store and online we are ideally positioned to 
capitalise on this changing marketplace.
Our continued investment in stores, people and systems has provided 
a strong platform to support growth. Current trading is in line with 
management’s expectations for 2016.
I would also like to add my great thanks to those of the Chairman, in 
recognising all our people whose skills, commitment and enthusiasm 
continue to drive our success, and who give us confidence in the future.

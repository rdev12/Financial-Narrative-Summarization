DEFINITIONS OF TERMS:
In order to reﬂect underlying business performance, comparisons 
of revenue between periods have been adjusted for exchange rates
and the number of trading days. Changes in proﬁt, cash ﬂow, debt 
and share related measures such as earnings per share are at
reported exchange rates.
Enterprise Business System (EBS): In order to make clear the costs 
of the EBS project and the underlying performance of the business,
EBS costs have been disclosed separately. Therefore, unless explicitly
stated, measures based on operating costs, contribution and process
costs exclude EBS.
Headline proﬁt: A proﬁt of £0.8m (2006: charge £7 .7m) was incurred
in the year for items excluded from headline proﬁt. Details of these
items are given in the Income Statement on page 24 of this report.
Key performance measures such as return on sales, EBITDA and 
ROCE use headline proﬁt ﬁgures.

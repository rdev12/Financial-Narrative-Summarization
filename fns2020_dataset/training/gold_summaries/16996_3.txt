 WELLSTREAM HOLDINGS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2009
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
CHAIRMAN’S
STATEMENT
I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT
AGAINST DIFFICULT TRADING
CONDITIONS, THE GROUP
HAS MAINTAINED A STRONG
OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE,
WITH REVENUE GROWTH, LOWER
NET DEBT AND EARNINGS IN
LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS.
The rapid fall in oil prices at the end of
2008, and the on-going financial crisis
in the first half of 2009, significantly
interrupted the investment phase and
pace of offshore developments outside
Brazil. However, a recovery during the
second half of 2009 has left current oil
prices substantially above the level
required to ensure offshore developments
are economic. This, and returning
customer confidence as the global
economy recovers, leaves the Board
more optimistic regarding the outlook
for the business.
As a manufacturer of specialist products,
the Group is uniquely positioned to
benefit from long term growth within a
critical sector of the oil and gas industry.
During the year we completed the
expansion of our production capacity,
extended our product qualification
envelope and improved the operational
efficiency of the Group. This will enable
us to capitalise on the significant growth
opportunities that are clearly available.
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
The Group achieved record revenues in
the 12 months to 31 December 2009 of
£400.7m (2008: £369.9m). Profitability
was below that achieved in a record
2008, nevertheless, the Group generated
diluted earnings per share of 34.2p
(2008: 52.3p); the second highest result
the Group has ever achieved. Operating
activities generated strong cash flow
of £39.7m (2008: £36.3m). We propose
to maintain our full year dividend at
10p (2008: 10p).
OPERATIONS
Throughout the year, Wellstream’s business
in Brazil has performed exceptionally well
and the production facility has run close
to full capacity. Our Brazilian team has
secured a number of key contracts to
supply flexible products for the initial
phases of the TUPI project – the first
major Pre-Salt development. In June we
also commenced a major programme
that will see us qualify a broad range of
Wellstream products for use in deepwater
Pre-Salt developments. This positions
the Group well for what is a significant
market opportunity.
Outside of Brazil, trading conditions have
been more challenging during 2009.
The financial crisis in 2008 resulted in
customers postponing final investment
decisions and in response to this market
weakness we undertook a Group-wide
cost reduction programme.
STRONG OPERATIONAL
PERFORMANCE, WITH
REVENUE GROWTH,
LOWER NET DEBT,
AND EARNINGS IN LINE

CHAIRMAN’S
STATEMENT
Notwithstanding the difficult market,
the Group has moved forward on a
number of fronts and 2009 has seen
some significant achievements for the
business including;
Successful delivery of the TUPI
Extended Well Test (EWT) project
for Petrobras
On-going awards under the four year
Framework Agreement with Petrobras
which total some £200 million
Securing additional leased land
adjacent to our Niterói facility
Manufacture of the first high pressure
(15,000psi) risers for Anadarko
Petroleum’s Caesar Tonga project
in the Gulf of Mexico
Successful divestment of our onshore
FlexSteel
TM
business
Substantial completion of our first
major installation project through
the Seastream Joint Venture.
Further, 2009 has seen the Group
achieve its best ever safety performance
with a Lost Time Incident (LTI) free
year in Newcastle and a record safety
performance in Niterói. This is a fantastic
achievement and the result of a long-
standing and continuing focus on
delivering the highest safety standards
across the entire business.
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
During the year we appointed two
directors to the Board, Luis Araujo
and Alasdair MacDonald. Both bring
significant sector experience and abilities
and I look forward to working closely
with them.
Gordon Chapman, our CEO was
unfortunately taken ill and is recuperating
at home. The Board and staff wish him
well for a speedy recovery. Alasdair
MacDonald was appointed as Acting
CEO in his absence and I thank him
for his contribution.
OUTLOOK
The Group has successfully addressed
a number of challenges in 2009 which
positions us well to benefit from an upturn
in the oil and gas industry as a whole,
and the subsea sector in particular.
The flexible pipeline market has seen
compound growth rates of 7%-10%
(a)
per annum and the drivers for this growth
are still very much intact. The outlook for
the sector remains positive despite short
term uncertainty outside Brazil and our
focus on developing critical technology
and integrated solutions will allow us to
further benefit from this.
Looking forward, the potential for
significant growth in Brazil is clear and
evidence of an improvement in market
activity elsewhere supports some
optimism, although the Board’s near
term outlook remains unchanged.
Finally, I pay tribute to the professionalism
of our staff whose hard work and
dedication have delivered this strong
operational performance.

Chief Executive Officer’s review
In May 2015, we announced a clear 
strategic plan to transform De La Rue in 
the five years to 2020 into a technology-led 
security product and service provider, with 
a more balanced business portfolio that 
will deliver growth and increased profits, 
as well as reduce performance volatility. 
Changes in the market and customers’ 
shift towards more technology-based, 
value driven procurement mean we must 
be more flexible and agile in our approach 
to managing our customer relationships, 
product pipelines and delivery.
As our product lines are exposed 
to different market dynamics we have 
identified two courses of action: Optimise 
and Flex and Invest and Build (see pages 
10 to 13 for a detailed description of our 
strategy). We have set out implementation 
plans and a clear roadmap in each of 
these areas with the aim of achieving:
• Better business mix
• Less volatile performance
• Lower customer concentration
• Higher quality earnings
 
During the year, we reorganised the 
business to a functional structure (see 
below for more about the reorganisation). 
In parallel with the reorganisation, 
I strengthened my Executive Leadership 
Team with a number of new hires, including 
Chief Financial Officer Jitesh Sodha, Chief 
Technology Officer Selva Selvaratnam and 
Chief Commercial Officer Richard Hird, 
as well as streamlining and reshaping our 
Senior Leadership Team to align with the 
functional structure. We also established a 
product management team to ensure focus 
on the development of each product line.
We are one year into our five year plan 
and have already made good progress 
in expanding our polymer product line 
and enhancing our product and service 
offerings with the launch of two end-to-end 
software solutions. We have also taken 
actions to address the overcapacity in 
Banknotes and sold the underperforming 
cash processing business. I am pleased 
with the progress we have made in the 
first year and I am confident that the right 
foundations are now in place to grow the 
business. However, there is still much more 
to do in order to deliver our strategic goals.

Chief Executive Officer  
Our core strengths:
Trusted brand with 
longstanding customer 
relationships
Leading market 
positions in highly 
specialised industries
World leading design 
skills and capabilities
Heritage of product 
innovation
Proven track record  
of delivering operational 
excellence
Reorganisation 
To support the delivery of our strategy, 
we have reorganised the business from a 
divisional structure to a functional structure, 
focusing on innovation and technology, 
customers and delivery. Completed in 
October 2015, the new organisational 
structure is vitally important to our integrated 
operating model. It encourages greater 
collaboration among functions and aims to 
crystallise internal synergies. It also creates 
a lean and dynamic organisation that adapts 
to the ever-changing needs of our customers 
and competitive environment. 20 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Chief Executive Officer’s review 
continued
Optimise and Flex
Currency is core to our business and 
our brand. The number of banknotes in 
circulation is expected to grow at 3-4% 
a year
1
, but with ongoing oversupply 
in both the banknotes and paper 
making industries, we must optimise 
our capabilities by continuing to drive 
operational efficiencies and cost reduction. 
The volatility of the banknote market means 
it is essential that we build flexibility into our 
production capacity.
Banknotes
We made good progress in achieving 
production cost reduction through 
our ongoing Operational Excellence 
programme. We finished rolling out  
the Advanced Product Quality Planning 
(APQP) system, giving us a standardised 
process across all manufacturing sites.  
This enables us to share best practice, 
improve productivity and reduce spoilage. 
 
In December 2015, we announced 
the results of our manufacturing footprint 
review. The review concluded that we 
can achieve more than £13m of annual 
savings from FY2018/19 by reducing the 
number of print lines and consolidating 
banknote production into four centres of 
excellence. This will reduce our banknote 
print production capacity from eight billion 
to six billion
2
 notes a year, matching current 
and long term average market demand, 
as well as increasing our machine utilisation. 
The implementation of the restructuring 
plan is now under way following the 
conclusion of the consultation with affected 
employees (see below for more about the 
manufacturing footprint review).
We plan to gain access to additional 
capacity, as and when required, through 
external partnerships. During the year, 
we have successfully outsourced the 
printing of 500 million banknotes to three 
commercial and state banknote printers. 
We are now looking to build stronger 
relationships with selected third parties.
 
Banknote Paper
In the past year we saw increased 
demand for Banknote Paper though pricing 
remained competitive as a result of industry 
overcapacity. We made good progress 
in reducing production costs by driving 
efficiency and reducing overheads. We will 
continue to drive down cost and focus on 
growing direct sales. We are also seeking 
strategic partnerships in this market and 
exploratory discussions with a number 
of parties are ongoing, though they are 
complex and will take time. 
Cash Processing Solutions
In November 2015, we announced a 
‘root and branch’ review of CPS to address 
ongoing underperformance. We have 
completed the review and concluded that 
whilst CPS has a strong product profile and 
excellent long term customer relationships, 
we do not believe that this is a business 
which should form part of our portfolio. 
In order to focus on our core businesses, 
we have decided to exit the cash 
processing market by selling CPS to Privet 
Capital LLP . We believe that the business 
will benefit from standalone ownership.
Manufacturing 
footprint review
In light of the continuing overcapacity in the 
banknote industry, we launched an extensive 
review of our manufacturing footprint in May 
2015. We completed the review in December 
2015 and concluded that in order to improve 
efficiency and reduce cost, a restructuring of 
the footprint was needed. We plan to reduce 
our banknote print production capacity from 
eight billion to six billion
2
 banknotes per year 
by reducing the number of print lines from 
eight to four and consolidating banknote 
production into four centres of excellence: 
in Kenya, Sri Lanka, as well as Gateshead 
and Debden in the UK. The existing banknote 
production in Malta will be closed. We will have 
the ability to increase capacity up to seven 
billion notes through built in flexibility and to 
access to additional capacity through external 
partnerships. In order to accelerate growth in 
Identity Solutions and Product Authentication 
and Traceability, we plan to invest in new 
technologies and skills to create a centre of 
excellence for identity and security print at the 
current site in Malta. The restructuring requires 
an incremental capital investment of c£15m, 
with an associated one-off cost of £8m over 
the next two years. The plan is expected to 
generate more than £13m annual cost savings 
once it is complete in FY2018/19.

Invest and Build
We continue to build on De La Rue’s 
long history of innovation, investing in 
differentiating features, new technologies 
and digital solutions. We have restructured 
our R&D team and prioritised our efforts in 
high growth and high margin product lines. 
We plan to double our R&D investment 
by 2020.
In order to accelerate growth in Identity 
Solutions and Product Authentication and 
Traceability (PA&T), we plan to invest in new 
capabilities and skills to create a centre of 
excellence for identity and security print at 
the De La Rue site in Malta. We have also 
put in place a dedicated team with new 
skills to strengthen our sales effort for both 
Identity Solutions and PA&T.
Polymer
Launched in 2012, sales of our polymer 
substrate Safeguard
®
 have started to gain 
traction. We built on the progress made in 
2014 by growing the number of customers 
from seven to 14, including all three 
Scottish note issuing banks. We reached 
an important milestone by winning our first 
volume customer, with a significant three 
year contract of polymer substrate and 
a technology partnership. This raises our 
nominal market share to c5% by volume. 
We aim to continue to grow our market 
share by targeting customers that already 
use polymer as well as those looking to 
convert paper and coins to polymer. 
 
Revenue breakdown
 Optimise and Flex 69% 
 Invest and Build 31% 
We continue to focus much of our 
R&D efforts on developing our polymer 
capability, expanding the number of 
polymer-suited security features and 
enhancing the process for substrate 
manufacturing and banknote printing. 
There is a growing interest in polymer 
banknotes as central banks look for ways 
to reduce the overall cost of banknote 
ownership. As the only integrated polymer 
substrate manufacturer and experienced 
polymer banknote printer, we are well 
placed to capture this growth opportunity.
Security features
We believe that continuous innovation will 
give us greater differentiation and a unique 
advantage in a competitive market. 
In 2015 we made good progress in 
security feature development, with the 
launch of a micro-optics security thread 
– Active™ – which has already won its 
first two customers. The combination 
of cutting edge lenticular technology with 
microscopic fine line printing gives the 
new feature a distinctive 3D colour shifting 
effect that is simple to verify but difficult 
for counterfeiters to replicate. 
To maximise the value of our existing 
product capabilities, we have started to 
explore cross-product utilisation, such as 
applying polymer and holographic features 
to passports. We also leverage our award 
winning design capabilities to enhance 
the sales channel for our new features 
by incorporating them into banknote 
and passport designs. In order to be 
at the forefront of technological progress 
and to accelerate product development, 
we continue to seek partnerships with 
research institutes and universities.
Differentiating 
through design
The design team plays an important role in 
each stage of our integrated business model. 
Our refined engraving skills and a century 
of knowledge and experience in banknote 
production give us a competitive advantage. 
The introduction of our polymer substrate 
Safeguard
®
 provides further opportunity 
for design innovation, illustrated by the new 
Maldives banknotes (see image) launched 
in November 2015. Moreover, the new 
UK passport, designed and produced by 
De La Rue, won the 2015 London Design 
Award for its sophisticated security layering 
and intricate design.  22 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Chief Executive Officer’s review 
continued
Continuous innovation
According to the World Bank, more than 
100 countries around the world don’t have 
efficiently functioning civil registration systems. 
DLR Identify™ CRVS (Civil Registration, Vital 
Statistics) extends the DLR Identify™ service 
from passports to civil registration. It enables 
governments to record life events of their 
citizens such as births, death and marriages 
more efficiently and cost effectively. The data 
recorded establishes the rights of individuals to 
services such as education and health care as 
well as providing vital statistics to governments 
for future planning.
Identity Solutions
In collaboration with Her Majesty’s 
Passport Office (HMPO) in the UK, we 
redesigned the UK passport. The redesign 
was launched in November 2015. The 
passport won the prestigious London 
Design Award for its intricate design and 
sophisticated security layering. It includes 
one of our latest inventions, the Continuous 
Bio-Data Page™ construction method 
which makes the passport much harder to 
counterfeit. To further enhance our passport 
offering we also acquired expertise, unique 
manufacturing capabilities and technologies 
by partnering with Japanese printer 
Dai Nippon Printing Co.
As countries increasingly look for 
secure and technology based population 
authentication and border control, there 
is expected to be a growing demand 
for end-to-end solutions and services. 
In June, we launched our first identity 
software suite – DLR Identify™ which 
provides an end-to-end solution for 
governments to manage and monitor 
the process for authenticating and 
issuing a passport. 
Product Authentication and Traceability
We made steady progress in PA&T during 
the year, with the launch of our next 
generation digital solution – DLR Certify™. 
The end-to-end solution provides a track 
and trace capability, helping governments 
and commercial organisations to protect 
tax revenue and the integrity of their 
products and brands. We have already 
secured our first customer and will 
continue to focus on building credibility 
by securing reference customers. We have 
also initiated discussions with a number of 
potential technology partners to strengthen 
our digital platform. 
Operational excellence
As part of the Operational Excellence 
programme, we have introduced the 
Advanced Product Quality Planning system 
used widely in the automotive industry into 
our product development process. The 
purpose of this process, known as ‘design 
for manufacture’, is to design products 
according to our manufacturing capabilities 
and allow potential problems to be fixed in the 
design phase, avoiding substantial wastage 
at the manufacturing stage and saving costs. 
Rigorous quality control is then applied at each 
stage of the production process by shop floor 
operators, who are accountable for meeting 
cost and quality targets.

Driving a high performing culture
We recognise the importance of corporate 
culture to the success of our strategy. 
In order to become a dynamic, agile and 
results driven organisation, we have made 
significant changes in the last 18 months, 
including the complete reorganisation 
of the business and a revision of sales 
incentive schemes. To create a flatter 
organisational structure, we have reshaped 
the Senior Leadership Team to a smaller 
number of talented people with increased 
accountability, and reduced total average 
headcount by 10%.
To encourage a performance driven 
culture, we have launched a recognition 
programme – High Five – where employees 
can be recognised and rewarded by 
their colleagues and managers for 
demonstrating the Company values and 
for outstanding performance. We have also 
put in place a performance management 
framework, including regular personal 
development reviews for all employees.
As part of our leadership development 
and succession planning, 50 of our Senior 
Leadership Team members took part in 
a customised Harvard Intelligent Strategy 
programme. The programme builds 
insight and capability in strategic thinking, 
strategy execution and managing change. 
With the first phase of the programme 
completed in December 2015, the second 
phase has now started and focuses on 
implementation. In addition, we launched 
the Centre for Learning platform that will 
provide best in class training for all 
De La Rue employees.
Currency performance
The Currency segment comprises 
Banknotes, Banknote Paper, Polymer, 
and Security Features.
The segment grew its revenue by 
11% to £353.3m (2014/15: £317.9m) 
and operating profit by 9% to £55.1m 
(2014/15: £50.5m), primarily reflecting 
the increased volumes in Banknotes.
While volatility in the banknote market 
continued and orders remained lumpy, 
overall margins in the year were stable. 
Banknote volumes increased by 9% to 
7.1bn notes (2014/15: 6.5bn) partly due 
to winning overspill orders. Following 
extensive trials, production of the new 
£5 Sterling polymer notes began in 
October 2015 and is progressing well. 
Banknote Paper volumes were up 6% 
to 10,000 tonnes (2014/15: 9,400 tonnes), 
also benefiting from overspill contracts. 
Margins, however, continued to face 
downward pressure from oversupply 
in the industry.
Polymer gained encouraging momentum 
marked by the significant three year 
contract with a large customer, which 
resulted in a modest revenue contribution 
and a small operating loss for the year. 
Security Features performed as expected, 
though an important five year contract, 
which had contributed annual revenue 
of £30m, came to an end and was 
not renewed. While this is expected to 
affect the profitability of this product line 
in 2016/17, we are confident that we 
can mitigate the impact through other 
opportunities that we are actively pursuing. 
We remain optimistic about the long term 
growth prospect of this business.
At the year end the 12 month order 
book for Currency including estimated 
call-off orders for material contracts was 
up 85% at £278m on a like for like basis 
(2014/15: £150m). This provides good 
visibility for 2016/17. 24 De La Rue Annual Report 2016
Chief Executive Officer’s review 
continued
Identity Solutions performance
Revenue was 5% lower at £65.8m 
(2014/15: £69.0m) and operating profit 
was down to £6.4m (2014/15: £11.1m). 
The decline in both revenue and operating 
profit was expected and predominantly due 
to contractual reduction in contribution on 
a large contract.
The ten year contract with HMPO in 
the UK to produce and issue passports 
continues to perform well. Volumes were 
up 2% year on year. A new design of the 
passport was launched in November 
2015 which included our latest security 
features Continuous Bio-Data Page™ 
and SkyLight™. 
Sales of e-passports were slower than 
anticipated as a number of expected 
tenders were delayed, although the sales 
pipeline remained good. Our main focus 
in the next 12 months is to convert some 
of the pipeline to revenue and profit. 
In June 2015, we launched our first identity 
software suite, DLR Identify™. During the 
year, we successfully installed the software 
with its first customer.
 
Product Authentication and Traceability 
performance
Revenue was flat year on year at £39.5m 
(2014/15: £39.6m), with operating profit 
up 19% to £8.9m (2014/15: £7.5m). The 
higher operating margin was due to cost 
savings from the closure of the Dulles site 
in 2014/15.
We continued to focus on building 
reference customers in both the public 
and private sectors, aiming particularly at 
central governments and enterprises that 
produce high value goods or operate in 
highly regulated industries. 
Our track and trace solution DLR 
Certify™ was launched in April 2015 and 
successfully delivered to its first customer 
in November 2015. 
Cash Processing Solutions 
performance
Sales volumes in Cash Processing 
Solutions (CPS) were affected by increased 
competition and adverse exchange 
movement, which resulted in a 33% decline 
in revenue to £33.9m (2014/15: £50.7m) 
and an operating loss of £7.9m 
(2014/15: operating profit of £0.4m). 
Following a ‘root and branch’ review 
initiated in November 2015, we have 
decided to exit the cash processing 
business. The sale of the CPS business 
was completed on 22 May 2016.

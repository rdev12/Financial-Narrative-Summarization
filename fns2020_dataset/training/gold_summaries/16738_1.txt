GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
PATRICK HAREN
This is a good set of results.  Pro-forma profit before interest and tax
(based on regulated entitlement and pre exceptional items and
goodwill amortisation) grew from £112.5m to £129.0m reflecting
increased profits from VP&E, Sx3 and Powerteam together with
further realisation of value from property disposals.
NIE’s T&D business has completed the third year of its current five
year price control, which is effective until March 2007.  NIE Supply’s
price control was successfully extended to March 2007 and we have
recently agreed with the Northern Ireland Authority for Energy
Regulation (NIAER) a one year price control extension for the Power
Procurement business (PPB) from March 2005 to March 2006.  We
continue to pursue an extension to SONI’s price control from March
2005 to March 2008.  
VP&E increased its profit contribution by 38% to £25.2m (2004 -
£18.3m) principally as a result of growth in the Republic of Ireland
(RoI).  Energia, our competitive supply business, now has c15,000
business customers across Ireland.
Sx3 increased its profits significantly during the year, achieving an
operating profit margin of 10.8%.  The sale of Sx3 follows disposals
of other non-core businesses over the last number of years.  These
disposals have reinforced our commitment to energy markets in
Ireland.  Specifically they provide us with the balance sheet strength
to effect a significant return of value to shareholders, to invest
further in generation on the Huntstown site and to pursue other
energy related investment opportunities across Ireland.
Northern Ireland Electricity
Transmission and Distribution 
T&D revenues (based on regulated entitlement) decreased by £2.0m
due to lower price control revenues together with new arrangements
for funding energy efficiency projects which were previously funded
via T&D’s use of system charges.  These decreases were partly offset
by increased revenues associated with the recovery of market
opening costs.  Based on regulated entitlement, T&D made profits of
£71.4m compared to £73.9m last year.  This reflects the reduction
in price control revenues together with a higher depreciation charge
and an increase in provisions required for further employee
reductions, offset by reductions in operating costs.  Areas in which
reductions in operating costs were achieved included lower staffing
levels and decreases in information technology and premises costs.  
While we continually exert downward pressure on costs, this is not at
the expense of standards of service to our customers.  We fully
recognise our responsibility to maintain and operate a safe and
reliable network.
We continue to make substantial investment in our infrastructure
assets.  Network capital expenditure was in line with the regulatory
allowance.  Total capital expenditure (before customer
contributions), including expenditure on customer service systems,
other non-network assets and new systems required to support
market opening in Northern Ireland, was £72.5m (2004 - £66.4m).
NIAER has agreed that approved expenditure and systems
associated with market opening in Northern Ireland will be recovered
over five years and will earn the regulated rate of return of 6.5% 
pre-tax real.
Power Procurement/SONI
Profits from PPB and the transmission system operator, SONI,
(based on regulated entitlement) increased to £6.5m (2004 -
£5.6m), reflecting increased trading income from PPB.  The price
control for PPB which was due to expire in March 2005, has been
extended to March 2006 by agreement with NIAER.  We have
submitted a proposal to NIAER for the SONI price control to be
extended from March 2005 to March 2008. 
NIE Supply
NIE Supply’s profits (based on regulated entitlement) increased to
£6.4m (2004 - £5.8m) as a result of reduced operating charges
primarily from lower staffing levels.  In August 2004 we reached
agreement with NIAER on a two year extension of NIE Supply’s price
control to March 2007.  This encompasses further investment in the
keypad pre-payment meters which have been promoted successfully
by NIE and are supported by NIAER.  It also covers further
investment in energy efficiency measures and a new programme to
promote the development of micro-renewable generation in the
domestic sector.
Powerteam
Powerteam made good progress during the year increasing its profits
to £4.6m (2004 - £2.4m).  This was driven by growth in its external
business and, in particular, a full year’s contribution in respect of
network refurbishment carried out under the three year framework
contract awarded in June 2003 by Electricity Supply Board (ESB).
While Powerteam derives the majority of its revenue from the T&D
business, external sales accounted for 41% of total sales in the year. Viridian Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2004-2005

Viridian Power & Energy
VP&E has delivered a strong operating performance.  Turnover
increased from £206.0m to £273.6m due to growth in its customer
base in both Northern Ireland and the RoI together with increased
prices associated with higher fuel costs.  Operating profit increased
by 38% to £25.2m (2004 - £18.3m) reflecting volume growth in
both markets and increased profits in the RoI, offset by lower profits
in Northern Ireland.
Our strategy in VP&E is to grow our supply position through a
combination of generation assets and wholesale contracts.  In
Northern Ireland, power is purchased under fixed price contracts
from Scotland through the Moyle Interconnector and from
generation, including renewable sources, in Northern Ireland.  In 
the RoI, customer contracts are backed by generation from
Huntstown 1, imports from Scotland and Northern Ireland and a
wholesale product (VIPP) made available by ESB.
Generation
Huntstown 1 continued to perform well achieving availability of 98%
in 2004/05 excluding the effect of the major planned outage which
started on 12 March 2005.  The planned maintenance for which this
outage was required was successfully completed within the
scheduled period on 18 April 2005.  As at 31 March 2005,
Huntstown 1’s gas requirements for 2005/06 were more than 60%
hedged and its requirements for CO
2
emission credits for the same
year (under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) which
came into effect on 1 January 2005) were fully covered by forward
purchase contracts.
Further investment in generation on the Huntstown site is central to
our strategy.  Last September, we announced our decision to
construct a further CCGT plant at Huntstown (Huntstown 2) with a
capacity of 400MW.  This is against the background of electricity
demand projections in the RoI which indicate a continuing need for
further generating capacity.  Construction is due to commence this
summer with commissioning targeted for autumn 2007.
For the few months during which Huntstown 2 is expected to be
operational in 2007, it will be allocated a share of CO
2
emission
credits set aside specifically for new entrants.  We expect the station
to receive a separate allocation of CO
2
emission credits (in line with
other generating plant in the RoI) at the start of phase two of the EU
ETS in January 2008.  
Supply
Energia, our competitive supply business, grew its customer base
across Ireland as markets, both North and South, opened further to
competition.  In the RoI, the remaining small to medium sized
enterprises (SMEs) and the whole of the domestic sector became
eligible for competition in February 2005.  In Northern Ireland, the
remaining SMEs became eligible for competition in March 2005 but
the domestic sector is not expected to open to competition 
until 2007. 
In the RoI, Energia has maintained its market share of some 33% by
volume of the large energy user (LEU) market, supplying c300
customer sites at 31 March 2005.  In the SME market, Energia has
increased its market share to 6% by volume (2004 - 1%) supplying
c11,200 customer sites at 31 March 2005 (2004 - c3,500).  Energia
plans to grow its customer base in the RoI to match the output from
Huntstown 2.  To facilitate this, Energia has secured two year
capacity over the North-South interconnector linking Northern 
Ireland and the RoI through which it will import power from Northern
Ireland.  For financial year 2005/06, Energia is offering to supply a
number of large customers with both electricity and gas.
In Northern Ireland, Energia has maintained its market share of
some 50% by volume of the LEU market supplying c400 customer
sites at 31 March 2005.  In the SME market, Energia has increased
its market share to 8% by volume (2004 - 4%) supplying c3,400
customer sites at 31 March 2005 (2004 - c2,700).  We expect the
SME sector to become fully active relatively slowly as SMEs install
the requisite on-line metering.  Energia plans to retain its customer
base against the background of the recent commissioning of ESB’s
new 400MW CCGT plant at Coolkeeragh in Northern Ireland and, to
assist this retention, has secured contracts beyond one year for
approximately 40% of its customer demand.
From 1 April 2005, suppliers in Northern Ireland are required to
source a proportion of their capacity from renewable generation
(2.5% in 2005/06 increasing to 6.3% in 2012/13).  Based on its
existing contracted renewable generating capacity (33MW), Energia
will be compliant under this obligation until 2010.  Surplus
Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) are expected to provide an
incremental profit opportunity in the short to medium-term.
Energia’s aim is to negotiate further contracts with windfarm
developers in Northern Ireland, either as offtake arrangements, or
through direct investment where returns are appropriate.
Single Electricity Market
The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) in the RoI and NIAER
are working towards the creation of a single electricity market for the
island of Ireland.  Proposals published at the end of March 2005
envisage a gross mandatory pool, namely a single wholesale market
in which buyers and sellers of electricity trade all their electricity on
a daily basis.  The proposals envisage some form of payment to
reward generators for making capacity available.  The final design for
the market will be published in June 2005, following consultation.
The target date for implementation is July 2007.
VP&E maintains a watching brief on opportunities to invest in further
interconnection between the RoI and Great Britain (East-West
interconnector) and in any upgrade to the North-South
interconnector between Northern Ireland and the RoI.
Sx3
Sx3 exceeded its target of a high single digit operating profit margin,
delivering a 10.8% margin (2004 - 6.1%).  Turnover increased from
£117.3m to £127.5m and operating profits increased from £7.1m to
£13.8m.  These increases resulted from strong performances by the
company’s Applications Solutions and Managed Services divisions,
continuing the trend towards a greater proportion of higher margin
services within the sales mix.  The sale of the business was
completed on 25 April 2005.  Sx3, under its new parent Northgate,
will continue to provide the Group with important IT and 
business services.

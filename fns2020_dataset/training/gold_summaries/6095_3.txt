Introduction
My first Chairman’s statement comes at
the end of what has been undoubtedly
a momentous year for Floors 2 Go plc. 
The Company was incorporated as WC Co(8)
Limited on 9 April 2003 and changed its name
to Smart Motive Limited on 18 December 2003.
On 19 December 2003, the Company
re-registered as a public limited company
and changed its name to Smart Motive plc. 
On 25 March 2004, having acquired the
entire issued share capital of Anglo Baltic
Limited, the company undertaking the trade
of the Floors 2 Go business, the Company
was admitted to trading on AIM. On the
same date the Company changed its name
to Floors 2 Go plc.
During 2004 Floors 2 Go consolidated its
position as the leading independent retailer
of laminate and wooden flooring in the UK
and began the implementation of its five year
plan to dominate this market sector. We opened
29 stores including 17 concessions in 2004
and closed four which brought our portfolio
up to 121 by the end of 2004. This expansion
included our first move into Scotland with
47,000 sq feet of concession space in
Texstyle World, a leading home furnishings
retailer. Our plan is to build a chain of
a minimum of 350 stores with an acceleration
towards this target in 2005.
Financial performance
The financial performance in 2004 was
extremely satisfying. As the acquisition of
Anglo Baltic Limited occurred on 25 March 2004,
these accounts comprise the nine months
trading period of the acquired activities to
31 December 2004. Sales for the nine months
ended 31 December 2004 were £61.97m and
resulted in an operating profit before goodwill
amortisation of £7.05m. Goodwill amortisation
and interest accounted for £1.84m, producing
a profit before tax of £5.21m. The tax charge
of £1.53m represents 29.5% of pre tax profits,
a rate which we consider sustainable
in future years.
Earnings per share for the nine month period
was 2.80p with 2.79p on a diluted basis.
I am pleased to report that your board will
be recommending a maiden dividend of
1.00p payable on 27 May 2005.
I think it is important to give shareholders
a fuller appreciation of our performance
to outline our results on a pro forma basis
for the full 12 months. The 2003 actual
comparatives are for Anglo Baltic Limited
for the year ended 31 December 2003.
These figures clearly indicate the strong
financial progress that Floors 2 Go has made.
The 2004 pro forma figures exclude the
impact of any adjustments arising from the
acquisition of the business and consist of
three months trading of Anglo Baltic Limited
and nine months trading post acquisition.
Finally, I would like to state the Company’s
corporate objective, which is to “Create
a highly focused retail chain which will lead
the laminate and wooden floor retailer sector
by providing a range of products in breadth
and quality which will be unsurpassed.
This dedication to quality and service whilst
providing value for money should provide a
financial return which will allow upper quartile
earnings and thereby dividend growth”.

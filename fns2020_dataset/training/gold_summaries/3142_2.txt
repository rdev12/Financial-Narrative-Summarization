 01 CeNeS Pharmaceuticals plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005
HIGHLIGHTS
CeNeS has a balanced portfolio of late  
stage compounds and pre-clinical projects 
comprising morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) in 
pivotal Phase III clinical trials for the treatment 
of post-operative pain; CNS5161 in Phase II 
clinical trials for the treatment of neuropathic 
pain; and CNS7056X in pre-clinical development 
as a short acting sedative for day case surgery. 
CeNeS also has a discovery programme to 
identify novel COMT inhibitors for the treatment 
of Parkinson’s disease and schizophrenia.
CeNeS is focused primarily upon drugs that 
are administered by a hospital-based specialist 
such as an anaesthetist or neurologist, and 
that can eventually be promoted to the  
end-user by a small, focused hospital sales force. 
OPERATIONAL
➡  M6G post-operative pain
Pivotal European Phase III trial for post-operative pain commenced 
in September 2005. Recruitment is underway and results are expected  
in H2 2006.
US Phase III M6G – FDA meeting scheduled for mid 2006 with aim  
of obtaining IND later in 2006.
Discussions being held with EU and US Regulators on additional studies 
required to expand product claims.
M6G intellectual property (“IP”) position strengthened in March 2006 
by the acquisition of an additional patented synthetic method.
➡  CNS5161 neuropathic pain
Successfully completed a Phase II study in neuropathic pain 
in June 2005.
Phase II trial protocols being developed for:
 – Diabetic neuropathic pain
 – Post-traumatic neuropathic pain
 – Post-operative pain
 – Opioid refractory cancer pain
➡  CNS7056X sedation and anaesthesia
Filing of US IND planned for 2006.
Very encouraging pre-clinical studies reveal rapid onset and offset  
of sedative action and rapid metabolism.
Pre-clinical studies support the potential to expand indications 
for CNS7056X into anaesthesia. Further studies in anaesthesia 
have been initiated at the University of Strasbourg, the University 
of Adelaide and under a Material Transfer Agreement with a major 
pharmaceutical company.
➡  COMT Parkinson’s disease and schizophrenia
Pre-clinical development candidate for Parkinson’s disease on plan  
to be selected from lead series in 2006.
New academic publications point to the use of COMT inhibitors  
to improve the profound cognitive deﬁcits of schizophrenia –  
an additional multi billion dollar market.
FINANCIAL 
➡  Cash resources at period end of £8.5 million 
(2004: £14.3 million)
➡  Loss for 2005 of £6.6 million (2004: £4.9 million) 
in line with expectations. The increase is due 
to planned expenditure on M6G’s clinical 
development and our other development  
and discovery projects

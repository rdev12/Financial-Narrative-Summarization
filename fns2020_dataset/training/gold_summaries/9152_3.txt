Chairman’ s statement
The last ﬁ nancial year has been a challenging one for Kingﬁ sher 
and for its shareholders who have seen a signiﬁ cant reduction in 
the company’s share price. Much of this has been a result of stock 
market volatility, which was caused by uncertainty in the global 
ﬁ nancial markets. During the year, investor sentiment moved 
against UK-based retailers, particularly those selling ‘bigger ticket’ 
items such as home improvement, as concerns about consumer 
credit availability grew.
Whilst stock market sentiment will always ebb and ﬂ ow, our job 
inside the company is to keep focused on moving the business 
forward aggressively but responsibly in order to optimise shareholders’ 
interests in the medium and long-term, as well as the short-term. 
Our model, which gives us exposure to opportunities in a range 
of markets, many in fast growing economies, should enable us 
to grow at rates which are notably higher than companies who 
are solely based in a single developed market. However, for the 
model to work most effectively, each of the units needs to 
perform and a close eye needs to be kept on the balance sheet. 
Against this background it was good to see a range of excellent 
performances by a number of our companies during this last 
year. Examples include Castorama in Poland, which had a 
very successful year, as did its namesake in France. Koçta¸ s, 
our Turkish joint venture, delivered very strong results and our 
new business in Russia made an extremely encouraging start. 
There are, however, areas where we need to see improvement, 
including our business in China, where the performance is 
being addressed.
Overall, total Group sales rose 8% to £9.4 billion in the year, with 
adjusted pre-tax proﬁ t down 2.8% to £386 million, largely due to 
a difﬁ cult UK market. 
In the UK, B&Q made major changes to its business, not only 
refreshing much of its ranges with new products, but revamping 
around 5.5 million square feet of its store space. This has been 
a demanding task which has been carried out well at a difﬁ cult 
stage in the business cycle. These changes are delivering good 
results, it was the right thing to do, and I am sure it will ensure 
B&Q is ready to take full advantage when the market improves.

Annual Report

Kingﬁ sher has good brands, exceptional international and national 
store footprints, and excellent people. These now need to be pulled 
together to deliver the necessary returns on our investments and 
sustainable proﬁ t growth which will ﬁ lter through into improved 
beneﬁ ts for our shareholders. 
At the end of the ﬁ nancial year, Ian Cheshire took over from Gerry 
Murphy as Kingﬁ sher’s Chief Executive. Gerry played a major part in 
developing the business, particularly from an international perspective, 
but now Ian has the responsibility of really delivering the Group’s 
potential. I am very conﬁ dent that he is the man for the job.
The spread of our Group means that there are many opportunities 
to invest. I am pleased to see that one of Ian’s ﬁ rst priorities following 
his appointment was to tighten up our controls over capital spend 
and to limit the overall amounts. However, if we are to move the 
business forward we do have to make ﬁ nance available for considered 
investment, whilst taking steps to ensure that our balance sheet is 
prudently protected. 
With this in mind and recognising the external economic environment, 
the Board has decided to reduce the ﬁ nal dividend by ﬁ fty percent 
and would expect to apply a similar cut to the forthcoming interim 
dividend. This would have the effect of rebasing the dividend to a 
level more prudently covered by current earnings from which it could 
grow consistent with the performance and capital needs of the Group. 
The Board is recommending a ﬁ nal dividend of 3.4p, making a total 
dividend for the year of 7.25p.
As I said at the beginning, this has been a difﬁ cult year for our investors 
but within the business there have been many major successes. 
This has been due to a combination of talent and hard work on the 
part of our 85,000 staff across the world. I would like to thank them 
for their enthusiasm and professionalism and wish them all the very 
best for the coming year.

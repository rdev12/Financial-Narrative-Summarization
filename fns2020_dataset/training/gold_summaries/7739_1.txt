Chief Executive’s business review
Overview of 2010 and Path to  
Profitability strategy
IdaTech commenced shipments of its new 
generation methanol/water fueled product, the 
ElectraGen™ME, in December 2010. This is  
the second of the new generation ElectraGen™ 
products to be launched and is an exciting and 
important development for IdaTech as it provides 
the cornerstone in its Path to Profitability strategy 
to cash breakeven and profitable growth. 
The new generation ElectraGen™ family of 
products incorporates substantial cost and 
performance improvements which can be sold 
profitably in significantly higher volumes than  
earlier versions. These improvements offer 
customers a compelling value proposition  
against diesel generators whilst yielding positive 
margins for IdaTech.
As mentioned in the Chairman’s statement, in 
October 2010, IdaTech completed the purchase of 
Plug Power Inc’s (“Plug”) off-grid liquid petroleum 
fueled product line (now called the iGen™LP) 
together with a worldwide, royalty free, perpetual 
license to all relevant intellectual property (“IP”). 
Under the terms of the agreement, IdaTech is able 
to leverage the Plug IP with its own IP and future 
inventions, creating one of the largest portfolios of 
commercial fuel cell related technology in the 
world. This puts IdaTech in a unique position to 
serve both the on-grid market with its ElectraGen™ 
range of backup power systems and the off-grid 
market with the iGen™LP. This acquisition doubles 
the Company’s effective potential market and opens 
the door to a substantially larger non-telecom 
market for off-grid products, as discussed below. 
Additionally, the acquisition provides IdaTech with 
state of the art, core fuel cell stack technology that 
has been proven for over a decade and which can 
be used in all of IdaTech’s markets.
As announced last year, IdaTech’s Path to 
Profitability strategy has four key elements. These 
remain unchanged, although the addition of the 
iGen™LP product accelerates the Group’s entry 
into new products.
Seeding the market: Prepare the worldwide •	
customer base for rapid adoption of IdaTech’s 
fuel cell products by the sale of profitable and 
reliable systems.
New product development: Identify and pursue •	
next generation fuel cell products that can 
compete directly in the diesel generator market 
and simultaneously derive attractive gross 
margins for the Group.
Lean production: Establishing and validating •	
flexible, low cost and high quality production 
capabilities.
Focusing on execution: Eliminate or •	
de-emphasise activities that distract the Group 
from its primary path to profitability and align 
resources to ensure success.
IdaTech successfully executed against this plan 
during the year, continuing to move towards 
profitable growth, achieving a substantially 
reduced gross margin loss and overall  
operating loss.
Seeding the market
IdaTech’s initial commercial focus is on the critical 
power backup market for the telecommunication 
industry. This market has been estimated to be 
worth around US$2 billion per annum, covering 
around three million sites globally. Geographically, 
the Group is targeting the key markets of Asia, 
India and the Americas. IdaTech believes that the 
new ElectraGen™ME pricing point expands its 
accessible market by about six-fold to around  
1.8 million base stations.
During 2010, IdaTech increased the number of 
distribution partners to 38, using this extensive 
network to cost effectively expand across wide 
geographies and gain access to the key decision 
markets within its target customer base. To date, 
the Group has achieved certification for its 
products with 27 telecommunications companies, 
including five of the top 10 telecommunications 
companies worldwide by revenue. 
During the year, IdaTech sold over 350 systems, 
280 of which (the new generation ElectraGen™H2 
and ElectraGen™ME products) were sold at  
a positive gross contribution margin (2009: 9 units). 
In order to manage its cash resources, IdaTech 
restricted the number of loss making earlier 
generation ElectraGen™ products and targeted 
the systems it sold to new and existing key 
customers that are able to support material volume 
growth in the future. This reduced the number of 
system sales and revenue compared to 2009.
The sales order pipeline at the end of the year had 
doubled to US$1.6 million (2009: US$0.8 million).
New product development
IdaTech’s intensive development and testing of the 
ElectraGen™ME ensured the launch of the new 
product in December 2010. This system currently 
represents the core product supporting the Group’s

Chief Executive’s business review continued
drive to profitable growth. The ElectraGen™ME 
cost base is significantly less than that of its 
predecessor system and is profitable at the gross 
margin level. Additionally, the durability of key 
components will increase while reducing its size by 
approximately 30%. The Group believes this 
product successfully competes directly with diesel 
generator systems.
With the addition of the iGen™LP product line, 
IdaTech can now enter the off-grid market much 
earlier than previously expected. This is of 
particular significance as the global off-grid market 
is very large. Around 1.6 billion people have no 
access to on-grid electricity and the need for 
electricity is expected to double by 2030. 
Additionally, around 95%, or 10,000mW (2 million 
5kW equivalents) of the off-grid power requirement 
is served by diesel generators. Initially IdaTech’s 
iGen™LP will be targeted at telecommunications 
applications as many of its customers have no 
satisfactory off-grid product. The estimated market 
size of this market is approximately US$3 billion, 
with over 100,000 potential sites worldwide. 
IdaTech believes that the iGen™LP could provide a 
reliable and cost effective solution for such 
customers and displace a large number of 
inefficient, polluting and noisy diesel generators 
with the iGen™LP. The Company will continue 
testing the iGen™LP and incorporating technical 
and cost saving synergies through most of 2011.
The Group’s product cost and performance 
objectives are being met through the following 
specific initiatives: 
proprietary technological advances; •	
product design simplification; •	
increased use of off-the-shelf parts; and •	
establishment of a global supply chain,  •	
taking advantage of lower cost jurisdictions.

Lean production
During 2010, IdaTech expanded the capacity of its 
production plant in Tijuana, Mexico adding key 
technical fabrication capabilities. This improved 
facility and manufacturing line gives the Group a 
flexible, low cost volume manufacturing operation 
without the need for large capital investment.
These improvements enable the facility to produce 
all lines of the ElectraGen™ range in an efficient 
and flexible manner with a capacity to build up to 
approximately 5,000 units. In early 2010, the 
Tijuana facility was awarded ISO 9001 certification. 
Focusing on execution
A key element to IdaTech’s successful completion 
and launch of the ElectraGen™ME during the year 
was the decision in 2009 to focus purely on product 
development for its core market in providing power 
for telecommunication applications. This approach 
was also instrumental in preparing production and 
conducting a smooth transition with key customers 
from the older products to the new ElectraGen™ 
products.
Financial overview
Revenue for 2010 was US$4.5 million, of which  
US$4.0 million was from the sale of products.  
In 2009 revenue was US$6.6 million in total, 
US$4.5 million from product sales and  
US$2.1 million relating to projects.
During 2010, IdaTech sold over 350 systems, 280 
of which were sold at a positive gross contribution 
margin (2009: 445 and nine units respectively). 
IdaTech’s next generation systems, the 
ElectraGen™H2 and the ElectraGen™ME, 
accounted for 280 of the 2010 unit sales. The 
remainder of the sales consisted of now 
discontinued, earlier generations of its products. 
This occurred because of the decisions taken in 
2009 as part of IdaTech’s Path to Profitability 
strategy. 
To restrict the sales of older, loss making •	
products during 2010 in order to manage the 
Group’s resources; and 
Not to pursue development projects but to focus •	
on new generation products.
A significant development during the year as a 
result of these decisions was the significant 
improvement in the gross loss of US$1.8 million 
which fell to US$3.2 million from US$5.0 million  
in 2009. This was despite the large fall in revenue 
from projects which typically have a much higher 
gross margin than product sales. Excluding the 
gross margin from projects, the gross loss from 
products improved from US$6.2 million to  
US$3.2 million. IdaTech plc Annual Report 2010 Business overview 09
In total, operating expenses fell by US$8.0 million 
to US$20.5 million compared with 2009. Research 
and development costs in the year were US$11.5 
million (2009: US$17.7 million). Allowing for the 
US$4.5 million impact in 2009 of the write-off of IP 
relating to the IdaTech’s 250W product, recurring 
expenses fell by US$1.7 million year-on-year due to 
the refocusing of the development team solely on 
the ElectraGen™ME product range.
Sales, general and administrative expenses were 
also lower at US$9.0 million (2008: US$10.8 
million). Overall administrative expenses fell by 
US$1.6 million versus 2009 mainly due to reduced 
share based payment charges in relation to the 
Groups employee equity plans and reduced legal 
and professional fees. Sales related expenses also 
fell US$0.2 million compared with the prior year 
despite the addition of extra sales resources in 
Asia Pacific due to lower travel, trade shows and 
advertising expenditures. 
EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, 
depreciation and amortisation) loss decreased 
significantly by US$5.3 million to US$20.0 million 
(2009: US$25.3 million) as a result of the lower 
gross margin loss of US$1.8 million and lower 
operating overheads of US$3.5 million (excluding 
the write-off of IP relating to the IdaTech’s 250W 
product in 2009).
There was also a material decrease in the 
operating loss for 2010 compared with 2009  
of US$9.8 million, falling from US$33.5 million in 
2009 to US$23.7 million as explained above.
Finance costs increased to US$3.6 million (2009: 
US$1.6 million) as the business was debt funded 
by its principal shareholder, the Investec Group. 
The loan is unsecured and interest is charged at 
8% per annum.

The income tax credit decreased to US$0.5 million 
(2009: US$2.6 million) due to the impact in 2009 of 
the write back of the deferred tax credit no longer 
required following the write down in the carrying 
value of the intangible assets relating to the 250W 
product line.
Cash outflow utilised by operations decreased to 
US$20.5 million in the year (2009: US$23.1 million). 
This occurred because of a lower operational loss 
of US$5.5 million (using the EBITDA measure 
which discounts the impact of non-cash charges), 
a decrease in accounts receivable of US$1.4m, 
offset by an increase in inventories of US$2.5 
million. These movements are explained below.
There was a large increase in the level of 
inventories of US$2.2 million at the end of 2010 
compared to 2009. There were three main reasons 
for this increase; the acquisition of materials 
relating to the off-grid iGen™LP product line 
acquired from Plug of US$0.7 million, the purchase 
of components for the newer generation products 
of $0.8 million and a buildup of work in progress  
of prior versions of the ElectraGen™XTIs of  
US$0.4 million ahead of shipment in early 2011 
which had been delayed from 2010. 
Accounts receivable decreased by US$1.4 million 
to US$2.4 million. This was due to two factors: the 
delayed shipment of ElectraGen™XTIs and a lower 
concentration of sales in the last quarter of the year 
compared to 2009.
Trade and other payables increased to US$9.3 
million from US$6.0 million in 2009. US$2.0 million 
is as a result of the increase in interest payable 
under the loan to Investec. The balance relates to 
extended credit from suppliers. IdaTech plc Annual Report 2010 Business overview 10
Chief Executive’s business review continued
Investment in tangible assets of US$0.9 million was 
more than double the amount spent in the prior 
year of US$0.4 million. This was due to the 
consolidation and expansion of the production 
plant in Tijuana of US$0.5 million and the purchase 
of certain equipment and tooling relating to the 
assets acquired from Plug for iGen™LP of 
US$0.4 million. 
There was a significant increase in expenditure on 
intangible assets of US$6.2 million (2009: US$1.3 
million). Of this, US$1.5 million was internally 
generated intellectual property relating to the 
development of the new generation ElectraGen™ 
products (2009: US$0.8 million), US$0.5 million 
(2009: US$0.5 million) of new IdaTech patents, 
reflecting the technological breakthroughs made in 
the new generation products and US$4.1 million 
related to the IP acquired as part of the acquisition 
from Plug.
During the year, IdaTech drew upon its loan facility 
with the Investec Group, its principal shareholder. 
During 2010, IdaTech drew down US$28 million 
including funding for the purchase of the assets 
and IP from Plug. At the end of the year the 
balance was $60 million. The loan is due for 
repayment on 31 March 2012 – see note 15.
Funding and going concern
These financial statements have been prepared  
on a going concern basis as the Investec Group, 
IdaTech’s main shareholder, has indicated its 
willingness to continue to fund the business. 
Additional disclosure surrounding the going concern 
and future funding is given in the Directors’ Report 
on page 11.
Current funding is via debt. Although the timing is 
yet to be finalised, the Board believes it would be 
desirable to raise additional equity funding,

Outlook
2010 was a significant turning point for IdaTech 
with the launch of its profitable products that are 
price comparable with diesel generators. This price 
competitiveness is expected to stimulate sales 
growth and further improve the gross margin. 
Progress towards this can already be seen in the 
results for 2010, which show a reduction in the 
gross loss from US$5.0 million to US$3.2 million in 
2009 and the increase in the sale of profitable 
systems of 280 in the year compared to just nine in 
2009. This positions the Group well for sustainable 
growth into 2011. 
During 2011 IdaTech will launch additional 
ElectraGen™ products and continue to develop 
the iGen™LP so it is ready for commercial 
deployments in 2012. 
The Board believes IdaTech is well positioned to 
take advantage of the significant market 
opportunities that it sees for its next generation 
systems and is confident of achieving increased 
profitable sales.

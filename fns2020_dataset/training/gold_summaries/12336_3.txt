 Introduction
My first report as Chairman and PlusNet’s first report to
shareholders as an AIM listed Company marks the end of an
extremely important and successful year in PlusNet’s history.
PlusNet has reported record operating profit before exceptional
item of £2.9m for the financial year, and ended the year with
89,825 Broadband customers. The popularity of our Broadband
products bears testament to their high quality and exceptional
value – our Broadband growth has been achieved entirely
through referrals and our reputation. Our financial success is a
clear endorsement of the strength of our low-cost and efficient
operating model.
Corporate developments
The key event of the year was the successful flotation on AIM 
on 14 July 2004. The placing of the Company’s shares raised
£0.5m of new money for the Company net of expenses and
reduced the shareholding of Insight Enterprises Inc. to 45%. 
In December we announced a further placing of the remainder 
of Insight’s holding in PlusNet. Insight has been able to meet its
objective of exiting its 95% holding in PlusNet in less than six
months following IPO – far more quickly than it had expected.
We were particularly pleased with the market’s reaction to 
the placing in December, with a significant appetite from a 
range of investors. We now have an excellent spread of
institutional shareholders and a clear mandate to pursue our
business strategy.
2004 has seen PlusNet established as a truly independent
business.
BT Relationship
On 13 December 2004, PlusNet entered into a memorandum of
understanding with BT Retail, which confirms the strong existing
working relationship between BT and PlusNet. The strategic
insight afforded by the BT Retail relationship has already
benefited PlusNet, and the working relationship is no better

“PlusNet has reported record
operating profit before
exceptional item of £2.9m
for the financial year, and
ended the year with 89,825
Broadband customers” exemplified than with the successful Teleworker product, 
which was jointly developed by BT Retail and PlusNet. Under our
strategic relationship we plan to develop a number of Broadband
solutions and customer offerings with BT Retail. Closely aligning
PlusNet with BT Retail will help PlusNet remain at the forefront of
developments in the Broadband market in the UK.
Team
The PlusNet management team working with Lee Strafford 
has applied extraordinary efforts in 2004 to deliver the IPO, a
successful separation from Insight as well as an excellent trading
result. However, PlusNet’s success in the Broadband market is
dependent upon the efforts and dedication of all of our
employees. A fundamental tenet of our success is maximising
automation through the continual development of our hardware
and software platforms in line with the rapidly developing
Broadband market. This demands excellent teamwork, focus,
technical expertise and execution. PlusNet has long recognised
the importance of its employees in driving the long-term success
of the business and I am delighted that the IPO has allowed us to
introduce new share option schemes which will properly reward
their efforts over the years. Options have been granted widely
across the business to reward the hard work demanded from 
our entire team.
Corporate Governance
At flotation, Michael Sherwin and I joined Bob Moya on the
PlusNet Board as Non-executive Directors, with one of our key
objectives being the formal introduction of appropriate corporate
governance practices. PlusNet’s experience as a separate
reporting segment of a NASDAQ listed business was good
preparation for AIM, as many important disciplines had already
been adopted. It is the Board’s intention to comply with the
Combined Code, where practicable, and where full compliance 
is not appropriate, due to the size of PlusNet, we will follow
guidance issued by the Quoted Companies Alliance. On flotation
we established an audit committee, a remuneration committee
and a nomination committee, more details of which are set out
later in this report.
Outlook
The Broadband market is continuing to grow rapidly. Whilst our
growth in 2004 has been driven by new customers demanding
basic Broadband connectivity, new opportunities lie in the
extension of our connectivity products and the delivery of new
Broadband enabled products and services. PlusNet is well
positioned to meet the evolving demands of its residential and
business customers as they seek to fully utilise the power of
Broadband. We have a comprehensive roadmap of emerging
Broadband products and services. We expect our commitment 
to choice, quality and value to position us as the one-stop-shop
for all of our customers’ Broadband services.

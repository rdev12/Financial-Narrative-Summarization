Overview

2008 activity and Objectives
Sales process for the USA business commenced in  
April 2008 after a comprehensive strategic review of the 
Company’s assets and prospects. The Board expects that 
the proceeds of any sale will enable it to repay all of the 
Company’s borrowings and leave it with significant net cash 
The USA sale, together with cash revenues from its 
Mauritanian producing interests, will provide funding to 
increase the Company’s investment in the considerable 
upside potential of its existing key assets in Africa and the 
Middle East, as well as to develop new opportunities 
Sterling will focus on an increasing number of higher impact 
exploration prospects
Independent consultants, RISC, in a review in April 2008 of 
two prospects in Kurdistan and Madagascar, indicated 
unrisked best estimate net prospective resources of over 
500 million barrels of oil with a high net estimate of over 
1,900 million barrels of oil for Sterling’s current interests
Conduct a 2D seismic programme in Kurdistan ahead of 
drilling in 2009 
Conduct well site survey in Madagascar and secure rig for 
high impact near-term drilling

The Chinguetti development programme in Mauritania has 
recently commenced, comprising three workover wells and 
two development wells with an initial target of doubling 
production. An appraisal well on the Banda gas discovery 
encountered gas and oil columns with contacts similar to 
those seen in the discovery well
Exploration well on the Charlie prospect, mean case 
21 million barrels and upside case 40 million barrels, 
offshore Gabon is planned for May. A well in Themis  
Marin drilled in January 2008 was plugged and the  
licence has expired
Strategy includes farmouts to enhance risk-reward ratios 
and enable development of a wider portfolio of opportunities
First quarter 2008 production averaged 5,824 boepd (year 
2007, average 5,760 boepd)
Cash and undrawn facilities of $16.4 million at end of  
Q1 2008
Sterling has signed letters of intent to sell peripheral USA 
properties for $8.7 million and has completed six USA  
farm outs in 2008

On completion the sale of our US business will leave Sterling financially 
well positioned, adequately resourced and more sharply focused.

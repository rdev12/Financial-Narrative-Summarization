n ew strategy 
Sterling is changing. I became CEO in 
early February 2008 and the Board has 
now completed a strategic review of the 
business and its prospects. Our near-
term objectives are clear; 
1. We intend to focus more on 
potentially transforming drilling activity
Our current portfolio already has a 
programme of very high impact work 
planned in the next year in Madagascar 
and Kurdistan, with important wells in 
Gabon and AGC. We will seek out more. 
Our focus areas will be Africa and the 
Middle East. We will take measured risks 
for major upside. An independent review 
by RISC on two of our prospects in 
Kurdistan and Madagascar, has 
indicated unrisked upside potential net 
to Sterling of up to nearly 2 billion 
barrels, with obvious implications for 
major value-creating possibilities.
2. To reduce our debt level and to 
improve our working capital position
We have reviewed our assets and for the 
reasons set out earlier we have 
announced plans to sell the USA assets 
in order to achieve this aim. We shall 
seek to farmout selectively, which is a 
sensible way to enhance the risk-reward 
ratio for our work, will enable us to 
diversify and extend our portfolio and 
improve near-term cash flow. Much has 
been written about the banking “credit 
crunch” and stock markets have seen 
major falls, so we wish to make Sterling 
resilient to these changed conditions.
 
Oil and gas prices are up, but so are 
costs 
Oil prices have more than doubled over 
the last year to record levels of over 
$110/bbl despite talk of “recession” in 
some of the major economies. Around 
80% of the increase in energy usage is in 
the “developing countries” and there is 
little spare producing capacity. US gas 
prices have risen over recent months, 
partly in response to oil prices, but also 
owing to the very cold winter there with 
record snow in many areas. 
Costs in the industry have been rising 
very rapidly too. Lead times on 
equipment and drilling have continued to 
cause problems. Good opportunities are 
hard to find and secure and there is a 
shortage of good and experienced 
people. Sterling is fortunate to have an 
excellent team who have an interest in 
over 10% of the Company. Our team is 
highly motivated to achieve success. 
High impact drilling and further 
projects sought 
We expect to drill prospects by the end 
of 2009 that will offer upside potential to 
Sterling of hundreds of millions of 
barrels. 
Our projects are described in detail 
elsewhere in this annual report. I am also 
excited about building new areas of 
activity too.
 
As well as expanding our portfolio of 
licence interests, we intend to add to our 
existing near term drilling programme, 
both onshore and offshore. This will be 
achieved by redeploying our capital to 
new activities or through sector 
consolidation. We wish to offer our 
shareholders value growth through high 
upside projects combined with careful 
asset management. 
c hief executive’s r eview
“I am very excited about Kurdistan 
and Madagascar, where 
independent studies have 
indicated a combined unrisked 
net economic value at potentially 
over $2 billion if both prospects 
are successful at the best 
estimate level.” Page 07

Material value in the exploration 
portfolio 
Great uncertainty has been created by 
the recent difficulties in the credit and 
stock markets. Their impacts have been 
widespread and harsh and we have to 
react to these and other factors in 
formulating our strategy.
 
As described in more detail earlier in this 
report, the Board has recently carried 
out a review of the relative upside 
potential and amount invested in each of 
the business areas. Sterling wishes to 
make sure that its finances are 
appropriately organised and resilient. 
Whilst the results of our drilling 
programme in the USA in the last year 
were good and 2008 has started well, 
the size of the investment required to 
enable that business to fully flourish  
is growing. 
 
Sterling has highly prospective assets to 
explore. With the fast tracking of 
Madagascar to drilling and the new 
licence in Kurdistan in the last year, the 
Board now believes it is in shareholders 
best interests to focus its resources on 
such high potential assets and 
opportunities and to reduce or eliminate 
its debt level. It therefore intends to 
Overview
dispose of its USA assets in 2008. This 
will enhance our working capital position 
materially by leaving us with significant 
net cash after the sale. We will continue 
with farmouts, not only to yield cash or 
reduce the near-term costs of the wells 
but also to swap for other assets, 
thereby managing and diversifying the 
portfolio. This will also help to show the 
material value in our exploration portfolio 
which in current market conditions 
appears to be largely ignored and will 
allow Sterling to add new opportunities 
for growth in Africa and the Middle East.

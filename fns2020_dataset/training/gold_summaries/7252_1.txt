 Hellenic Carriers is pleased to report very strong ﬁnancial and

payment of a ﬁnal dividend for 2010 of GBP 5.45 pence per share or
total GBP 2,486,118 evidencing the Company’s consistency and
reliability throughout the shipping cycle.
During the year we continued to employ our vessels primarily under
medium to long term charters generating healthy cash ﬂows, to
strengthen our balance sheet and to reinforce our liquidity. This
strategy, which we have persistently followed during the last three
years, has allowed us not only to face challenging market conditions,
torewardourshareholdersthroughourdividendpayments,butalsoto
initiate our ﬂeet renewal and expansion programme.
Since early 2010 the market conditions placed a signiﬁcant premium
onsecondhandvessels,relativetothevalueofnewbuildings.Wetook
advantage of this opportunity by selling in May 2010 a 17-year old
Panamax dry bulk carrier at a price of U.S.$23.5 million out of which
U.S.$21.0 million was used towards debt repayment. We then placed
ordersfortheconstructionoftwoKamsarmaxnew-buildingvesselsat
U.S.$34.2 million each. Through the order of these vessels, which will
be delivered in the Q1 2013, we shall expand our presence in the
Panamax / Kamsarmax sector which has performed strongly and
shown resilience during times of depressed freight earnings.
Volatility has been present in the dry bulk market, however since Q4

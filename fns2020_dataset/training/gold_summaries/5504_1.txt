Delivering strong growth
2011	was	a	strong	year	for	EnQuest,	with	
annual	production	at	23,698	Boepd,	up	
12.5% on	2010.	Our	operations	generated	an	
excellent	financial	performance	with	cash	flow	
from	operations	of	$656.3	million	and	EBITDA	
of	$629.1	million.	Profit	before	tax	and	net	
finance	costs	increased	to	$390.1	million,	up	
130.3%	on	the	prior	year	pro-forma	equivalent.	
At	the	end	of	2011,	audited	net	2P	reserves	
were	115.2 MMboe,	an	increase	of	30.2%	over	
2010	and	of	43.1%	over	IPO	levels,	well	above	
our	10%	per	annum	long	term	reserves	growth	
target.	This	115.2	MMboe	at	the	end	of	2011	
represents	an	excellent	reserve	replacement	
ratio	of	419.4%.	
This	growth	in	reserves	was	driven	
partly	by	the	Alma	and	Galia	
development	project,	and	also	by	
our	active	business	development	
programme.	These	transactions	
brought further consolidation of 
EnQuest’s	existing	asset	positions	
and also took us into a number 
of	new	development	projects.
In	2011	EnQuest	put	in	place	the	
organisational building blocks needed 
to	ensure	sustainable	delivery	of	
medium	and	long	term	growth.	
The	substantial	growth	in	reserves	
demonstrates	EnQuest’s	ability	to	
deliver	sustainable	production	growth	
for	the	medium	and	the	long	term.	
EnQuest’s	2011	production	of	
23,698	Boepd	represents	a	further	
consolidation of our position as the 
largest	u K	independent	producer	in	the	
u K	North	Sea.	The	strong	production	
performance	reflected	good	growth	at	
each of our three existing production 
hubs,	we	invested	$360.6	million	in	
2011,	with	nine	wells	drilled	and	four	
production	wells	brought	on	stream.

Guidance range
Implementing EnQuest’s development 
and production focused strategy
With	approximately	340	undeveloped	
fields	in	the	u KCS,	there	is	a	significant	
opportunity	for	EnQuest	in	the	u K	
North	Sea,	particularly	in	the	smaller	
oil	fields	which	we	target.	EnQuest	
is	the	right	company	in	size,	scale	
and	financial	strength	to	exploit	the	
remaining opportunities in the North 
Sea	and	beyond.	We	are	focused	
on	both	existing	and	new	hubs,	
on	low	cost	near	field	exploration	
and appraisal and on business 
development	opportunities.	Our	
business	model	extends	asset	lives	
to realise the untapped potential in 
maturing	assets,	as	well	as	resources	
within	undeveloped	oil	fields.	
In	2011,	through	our	hub	focus,	we	
added	29.3	MMboe	to	EnQuest’s	
net	2P	reserves	for	the	Alma/Galia	
development.	We	delivered	exploration	
successes	with	the	Conrie	and	Crathes	
discoveries.	Our	execution	skills	are	
exemplified	by	our	Conrie	discovery	
and	development	which	took	less	than	
eight	months	between	discovery	and	
first	oil.	The	Kildrummy	appraisal	farm	
in	agreed	at	the	end	of	the	year	was	
the	last	of	a	steady	flow	of	business	
development	transactions	in	2011.	
EnQuest	significantly	increased	
its technical capabilities during 
2011,	enabling	us	to	take	on	large	
development	opportunities	such	
as	Alma	and	Galia,	and	more	
recently	Kraken.	Once	we	have	
identified	opportunities,	EnQuest	
uses its considerable expertise and 
capability	to	find	and	implement	
the	right	development	solution	
to bring projects on stream in a 
timely	and	cost	efficient	manner.	
A leading force in integrated 
development
In	2011,	EnQuest	developed	its	
operations	organisation	at	all	levels.	
In	Aberdeen	we	have	what	we	
believe	is	one	of	the	best	teams	in	
the	u K,	leaders	in	innovative	and	
cost	efficient	developments.	The	
wells	delivery	team	in	particular	
has produced a number of industry 
leading	performances,	including	
a	12,650ft	bit	run	for	the	Conrie	
exploration	well	in	the	Dons	area.	
These capabilities are a key differentiator 
and are critical to our ability to add 
value	to	the	projects	which	EnQuest	
invests	in.	We	have	continued	to	add	
highly skilled industry professionals 
with	extensive	experience.	This	scale	of	
organisational	development	is	critical	to	
delivering	EnQuest’s	ambitious	growth	
plans.	With	the	EnQuest	workforce	now	
more	than	double	its	size	at	flotation,	
we	are	ready	for	the	next	phase	of	
our	growth	and	beyond.	The	EnQuest	
development	machine	is	in	place.
Heath, safety, environment and  
quality (hs EQ) 
HSEQ	is	EnQuest’s	top	priority.	It	is	a	
critical and a deeply embedded part of 
our	culture	and	values,	and	is	integral	
to	how	we	manage	our	business,	with	
regard	to	people,	installations	and	the	
environment	in	which	we	operate.
In	2011,	EnQuest’s	safety	performance	
was	strong,	achieving	performance	
levels	which	were	in	the	top	quartile	
for	the	industry.	We	evolved	and	
strengthened	the	HSEQ	team	with	the	
appointment	of	a	new	head	of	Health,	
Safety,	Environment	and	Quality,	and	
with	the	creation	of	three	other	new	
professional	positions.	This	additional	
focus	will	help	to	bring	further	rigour	
to our performance and operational 
HSEQ	measures,	reinforcing	a	proactive	
continuous	improvement	culture	in	all	
of	our	assets	and	development	projects. EnQuest PLC

EnQuest’s first new hub – the Alma 
and galia development
In	November	2011,	EnQuest	gave	its	
internal sanction to the Alma and 
Galia	joint	development,	subject	to	
anticipated	regulatory	approvals.	
The	Alma	and	Galia	base	case	adds	
29.3	MMboe	to	EnQuest’s	net	2P	
reserves,	underpinning	our	medium	
term	production	growth.	First	oil	
is	expected	in	Q4	2013,	with	peak	
gross	production	of	over	20,000	
Boepd.	This	project	is	anticipated	
to	increase	EnQuest’s	production	
levels	to	over	40,000	Boepd	in	2014,	
approximately	a	two	thirds	increase	
on	2011.	EnQuest	intends	to	fund	
this	development	fully	from	current	
financial	resources.	EnQuest	secured	
the	Alma	and	Galia	licences	as	part	
of	the	26th	licensing	round,	and	the	
project	was	sanctioned	less	than	a	
year	after	award.	First	oil	is	targeted	
two	years	from	project	sanction.	Field	
Development	Plan	(FDP)	approval	
is	anticipated	in	the	coming	weeks,	
following	which	EnQuest	expects	
to	review	a	number	of	farm	in	
proposals	from	potential	partners.
The	Alma/Galia	project	exemplifies	
EnQuest’s	capabilities,	deploying	
many of the skills and methodologies 
used	on	the	Don	fields	development,	
with	a	fast	track	development	
solution,	reusing	an	existing	facility.	
The	development	will	be	tied	back	
to	the	modified	EnQuest	Producer,	
a	Floating	Production,	Storage	and	
Offloading	(FPSO)	vessel.	EnQuest	
took out an option to purchase this 
FPSO	from	Bluewater	Operations	
Limited,	and	this	was	duly	exercised	
in	Q1	2012,	for	a	cash	consideration	of	
$52.5	million.	Alma,	originally	named	
the	Argyll	field,	was	the	very	first	oil	
field	developed	in	the	u K	and	was	
abandoned	in	1992	at	a	70%	water	
cut.	The	EnQuest	development	plan	is	
designed to be capable of processing 
high	water	cut	levels	in	excess	of	
95%.	using	established	modern	
technology,	the	lives	of	these	two	fields	
can	now	be	extended	significantly.
Business development and EnQuest 
asset update
EnQuest’s	asset	base	continues	to	
grow,	Alma/Galia	will	be	our	fourth	
hub	and	will	take	us	from	seven	to	
nine	operated	producing	fields.	In	2011,	
our	business	development	efforts	
successfully demonstrated that there 
continue to be good opportunities in 
the	North	Sea,	where	we	consolidated	
our	positions	in	existing	assets,	as	
well	as	entering	into	new	appraisal	
and	development	opportunities.	
In	May	2011,	EnQuest	agreed	to	
increase	its	interest	in	Crawford/
Porter	from	19%	to	51%,	in	exchange	
for	carrying	the	previous	operator’s	
development	costs,	up	to	a	maximum	
of	$55.8	million.	In	August	2011,	
EnQuest	announced	an	increase	in	
its stake in the producing Broom 
field,	up	by	8%	to	63%	for	$7.5	
million,	increasing	net	2P	reserves	by	
almost	1	MMboe.	At	the	same	time,	
EnQuest	announced	its	farm	in	to	
the	Crathes	prospect,	taking	a	40%	
interest and assuming operatorship for 
zero	consideration.	The	subsequent	
exploration	well	at	Crathes	was	
successful	and	EnQuest	is	evaluating	
the potential commerciality of the 
Scolty,	Crathes	and	Torphins	area.	
Finally,	in	November	2011,	EnQuest	
agreed	to	farm	in	to	a	40%	interest	
in	the	Kildrummy	discovery,	and	to	
assume	operatorship	of	the	project.	
EnQuest’s	acquisition	model	is	
predicated	on	the	value	we	can	add	
to projects through our integrated 
development	skill	set,	rather	than	on	
being	able	to	secure	assets	below	
market	value.	EnQuest	maintains	a	
disciplined and rigorous approach 
to	reviewing	potential	opportunities,	
requiring	projects	and	acquisitions	
to meet returns criteria dependent 
on	the	specific	risk	profile.
The	Alma/Galia	project	exemplifies	
EnQuest’s	capabilities,	deploying	many	
of the skills and methodologies used on 
the	successful	Don	fields	development. EnQuest PLC

 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Another strong financial performance 
– cash flow from operations of  
$656.3 million
Profit	before	tax	and	net	finance	costs	
increased	by	130.3%	on	the	prior	
year	pro-forma	equivalent	to	$390.1	
million.	Pre-exceptionals	EBITDA	rose	
by	70.3%	to	$629.1	million	and	cash	
flow	from	operations	was	up	145.2%	
to	$656.3	million,	both	driven	by	the	
increased production and the increase 
in	the	oil	price.	The	same	factors	led	to	
a	110.0%	increase	in	reported	cash	flow	
from	operations	per	issued	Ordinary	
share,	up	to	81.9	cents	per	share	from	
39.0	cents	per	share	in	2010.	EnQuest	
continues	to	have	a	strong	balance	
sheet,	with	net	cash	at	the	year	end	of	
$378.9	million,	up	substantially	from	
the	$41.4	million	at	the	end	of	2010.	
The unit cost of sales production and 
transportation	was	$31.9	per	Boe	in	
2011,	up	on	the	pro-forma	$30.4	per	
Boe	in	2010.	The	increase	was	related	
to the net impact of the costs of the 
Thistle	shutdown	programme	and	the	
Don	Southwest	well	intervention,	offset	
by production increases from the Don 
and	Thistle	fields.	Capital	expenditure	
was	$360.6	million	in	2011,	this	included	
expenditure	in	relation	to	EnQuest’s	
sanctioning	of	the	Alma/Galia	project	
in	Q4	2011,	ahead	of	first	drilling	
on	Alma/Galia	in	Q1	2012.	The	total	
investment	in	Alma/Galia	in	2011	was	
approximately	$80	million,	with	around	
$95	million	of	capital	expenditure	
on	Thistle,	$80	million	on	the	Don	
fields	and	$30	million	on	Heather.	
2012 highlights so far
Business	development	in	2012	has	
started	strongly	with	several	substantial	
transactions	already	negotiated.	
EnQuest	agreed	the	acquisition	of	
45%	of	the	Kraken	discovery,	with	
20%	being	acquired	from	Canamens	
Limited	for	$45	million	in	cash	and	a	
further	$45	million	payable	at	FDP,	
and	a	further	25%	acquired	from	
Nautical	Petroleum	plc	(Nautical)	
through	a	development	carry.	The	
Kraken	development	has	substantial	
potential,	with	the	surrounding	areas	
also bringing additional exploration 
and	appraisal	opportunities.	EnQuest	
has also agreed a farm in option for 
45%	of	the	nearby	Ketos	discovery.	
With	its	technical	skills,	operational	
scale	and	financial	strength,	EnQuest	
is increasingly becoming the natural 
partner of choice for integrated 
development	projects	in	the	u KCS	
and	beyond.	If	Kraken	proceeds	to	
sanction	and	development,	the	timing	
of	the	anticipated	cash	flows	from	
Alma/Galia	will	be	complementary	
to	the	funding	of	Kraken.
Since	the	start	of	the	year	EnQuest	
has	also	agreed	to	acquire	an	
additional	18.5%	interest	in	West	
Don,	from	JX	Nippon	Exploration	
and	Production	(u K)	Ltd	(‘JX’)	for	a	
cash	consideration	of	$34	million.	The	
acquisition	also	includes	tax	allowances	
of	$2	million.	This	transaction	takes	
EnQuest	to	a	63.45%	position	in	
West	Don.	We	are	proud	of	our	
considerable	achievement	on	the	
Don	fields	and	pleased	to	be	further	
consolidating	our	position	on	West	
Don.	Completion	of	the	transaction	
is	subject	to	co-venturer	approvals.
In	Q1	2012,	EnQuest	established	a	
new	$900	million	Multi-Currency	
Revolving	Credit	Facility,	comprising	
of	a	committed	amount	of	$525	million	
with	a	further	$375	million	potentially	
available	primarily	for	acquisitions.	This	
facility	replaces	the	previous	$280	
million	facility	which	expired	in	Q1	2012.	
EnQuest	is	pleased	with	the	support	it	
received	from	the	lending	institutions	
which	provided	the	new	facility.	
Outlook and plans for 2012 and beyond
Despite	particularly	difficult	weather	
conditions in the Northern North 
Sea	in	Q1	2012,	production	year	to	
date	in	2012	has	been	in	line	with	
expectations	and	consequently	
EnQuest	reaffirms	its	previous	annual	
production	guidance	of	between	
20,000	Boepd	and	24,000	Boepd.
Over	the	course	of	2012,	EnQuest’s	
extensive	programme	encompasses	
the	drilling	of	at	least	11	wells,	two	on	
Thistle/Deveron,	four	on	the	Dons,	
three	from	batch	drilling	on	Alma/
Galia,	an	exploration	well	at	Tryfan	
and	an	appraisal	well	at	Kildrummy.	
EnQuest	will	also	complete	the	power	
upgrade installation at Thistle and the 
rig	reactivation	programme	at	Heather.	
EnQuest’s	2012	capital	investment	will	
be	approximately	$1,000	million,	with	
around	$500	million	at	Alma/Galia.	
This	is	EnQuest’s	most	active	annual	
work	programme	so	far	and	we	believe	
that	it	is	one	of	the	largest	2012	capital	
expenditure and drilling commitments 
in	the	North	Sea.	It	is	a	programme	
which	should	provide	a	contribution	
to	reserves	and	production	in	2012	
and	also	provide	a	bedrock	for	future	
reserves	and	production	growth.	
The	substantial	growth	in	
reserves	demonstrates	
EnQuest’s	ability	to	deliver	
production	growth	for	the	
medium	and	the	long	term.

EnQuest	welcomes	the	recent	oil	and	
gas	fiscal	adjustments	in	the	u K	2012	
Budget	and	looks	forward	to	working	
with	the	Government	and	the	industry	
to	achieve	the	optimum	development	
of	the	unrealised	potential	in	the	u K	
North	Sea.	EnQuest	believes	that	
these	positive	fiscal	changes	are	steps	
in the right direction to bring small

EnQuest	has	met	the	cumulative

targets	we	set	at	the	time	of	our	IPO	
and	our	track	record	is	proving	that	
we	can	sustainably	deliver	substantial

in	cash	flow.	Today	we	have	three	
producing	hubs,	with	a	fourth	hub	
in	development	and	in	Kraken	a	
potential	fifth	hub.	At	the	end	of	2011,	
EnQuest	had	22	production	licences	
covering	27	blocks	or	part	blocks,	
with	EnQuest	operating	19	of	these	
licences.	These	include	at	least	five	
discoveries	on	which	developments	
are	being	actively	considered.	We	
are	building	our	inventory	on	the	
mature	Thistle	and	Heather	fields	and	
extending	the	lives	of	those	fields	
which	have	the	potential	of	substantial	
remaining	oil	in place	combined	
with	recovery	levels	which	are	still	
materially	below	those	of analogous	
fields.	We	have	been	steadily	growing	
and	diversifying	our	asset	base,	
and	have	added	both	capacity	and	
capability	to	our	workforce.	This	
operational strength is underpinned 
by	a	very	strong	balance	sheet	and	
substantial	borrowing	capacity,	even	
after	the	major	investment	we	have	
commenced	in	Alma/Galia.	EnQuest	
has	the	technical	skills,	the	operational	
scale	and	the	financial	strength	to	be	a	
powerful	development	and	production	
company	in	2012	and	far	beyond.
With	EnQuest’s	technical	skills,	
operational	scale	and	financial	
strength,	EnQuest	is	increasingly	
becoming the natural partner of 
choice for major integrated 
development	projects	in	the	u KCS.
Our	track	record	is	proving	
that	we	can	sustainably	
deliver	substantial	growth	 
in	reserves,	production	and	 
in	cash	flow.

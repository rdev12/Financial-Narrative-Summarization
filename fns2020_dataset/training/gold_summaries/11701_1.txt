 Pace plc Annual Report and Accounts 2014 07
Strategic report / Chief Executive Officer’s review
Key highlights of the year
Pace is continuing to become a more 
profitable, cash-generative business with 
a broader spread of products and customers and 
a better mix of revenue. Revenue in 2014 increased 
by 6.1% ($2,620.0m vs $2,469.2m in 2013). 
Operating margin in the period increased from 
7 .8% to 9.2% reflecting strong contribution from 
the Aurora Networks acquisition (Networks), 
better revenue mix, improving supply chain 
effectiveness and lower underlying operating 
costs. On an underlying basis (excluding 
Networks), profitability increased (operating 
margin 8.2% vs 7.8% in 2013) despite lower 
revenue ($2,355.4m vs $2,469.2m in 2013). 
The cash flow performance of Pace remains 
strong with $204.0m of free cash flow generated 
in the period, 84.6% of adjusted EBITA.
Strategic plan
The Strategic Review undertaken in 2011 
highlighted that Pace operates in sustainable and 
profitable markets where we have differentiated 
capabilities; however, the Group must continue 
to execute on its three primary objectives to take 
advantage of the opportunities for improving 
both the level and quality of its earnings. We 
remain focused on these objectives and have 
made good progress both in delivering strong 
results in 2014 and creating a platform for 
further improvement in 2015 and beyond.
In addition to the various organic developments 
Pace has undertaken over the past two years, 
the acquisition of Networks is a key step in the 
evolution of Pace and enhances our strategy to 
grow a broader platform across Hardware, 
Software and Services.

 2  Norcros plc Annual report and accounts 2014
The Group has made good progress on delivering 
its strategic objectives, with the successful integration 
of the Vado business acquired in March 2013 driving 
excellent revenue and profit growth.
Chairman’s statement
Overview
I am pleased to report that Norcros has 
made significant progress during the year to 
31 March 2014, recording a fifth consecutive 
year of revenue and underlying operating 
profit growth. Despite mixed market conditions 
in the UK and a challenging environment in 
South Africa, Group revenue from continuing 
operations grew by 9.2% and by 16.6% on a 
constant currency basis. Underlying operating 
profit from continuing operations was 
25.5% higher at £16.1m.
The Group has made good progress on 
delivering its strategic objectives, with the 
successful integration of the Vado business 
acquired in March 2013 driving excellent 
revenue and profit growth. Tight cost 
control and cash management across all 
our businesses improved underlying return 
on capital employed from continuing 
operations to 15.0% (2013: 12.6%), towards 
the top end of our strategic target. The 
disposal of Johnson Tiles Australia 
announced in March 2014 and completed 
on 30 May 2014 now allows management 
to fully focus on its target geographies of 
the UK, Africa and the Middle East. We will 
continue to seek out opportunities to 
expand the Group through a combination 
of organic growth initiatives and acquisition 
of businesses in our target geographies and 
product groups.
Strong conversion of operating profit to 
cash meant that net debt at the end of the 
year was lower at £26.9m (2013: £30.7m), 
representing leverage of just 1.2x EBITDA, 
leaving the Group well placed to execute 
its growth strategy. 
Further progress on the Group’s legacy 
issues has also been made in the year 
with the agreement to sub-let the vacant 
surplus leasehold property at Groundwell, 
Swindon, to Network Rail. It is, however, 
disappointing to report that the sale of part 
of our surplus freehold land at Tunstall to 
Morrisons has not proceeded as expected.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend 
for the year of 0.34p (2013: 0.305p) per share. 
When added to the interim dividend of 0.17p 
(2013: 0.155p) per share which was paid on 
9 January 2014 this will make the total dividend 
for the year 0.51p (2013: 0.46p) per share, 
a 10.9% increase on the previous year.
Governance
As Chairman, one of my primary 
responsibilities is to ensure that the 
Group operates to the highest standards 
in all aspects of governance and risk 
management. Our aim within Norcros is 
to manage a growing business effectively, 
while ensuring that proper operating 
procedures and internal controls are

Overview Strategic report Corporate governance Group accounts Parent Company accounts
maintained at all times. Transparency 
is central to this objective and you will 
find more detail about our approach and 
progress over the last year in the Corporate 
Governance section. The Remuneration 
Committee Report is in accordance with the 
new reporting requirements of the Large

Board changes
In September 2013, Vijay Aggarwal 
resigned from the Board. Mr Aggarwal 
had been a Non-executive Director of the 
Company since October 2009 and has 
represented Lifestyle Investments Pvt Ltd, 
which was also a significant shareholder 
in the Company until its complete exit 
in September 2013. 
People
The people who work for the Group are 
undoubtedly our key asset and I am certain 
that the existing opportunities for long-term 
growth will ensure that our employees find 
Norcros a place where they will continue to 
enjoy rewarding careers. On behalf of the 
Board I congratulate them all for delivering 
another year of progress.
Summary
Norcros has continued its strong growth 
momentum and has again delivered a 
robust financial performance in line with 
market expectations. The Group remains 
in a strong financial position.
I believe that the Group will continue to 
make progress towards its strategic targets 
of doubling revenue to £420m by 2018 
through both organic and acquisitive growth, 
and achieving an underlying return on capital 
employed between 12% and 15% across the 
cycle. Underpinned by our strong brands, 
leading market positions and continued 
self-help initiatives focused on market share 
gain and operating efficiencies, I look forward 
to the future with confidence.

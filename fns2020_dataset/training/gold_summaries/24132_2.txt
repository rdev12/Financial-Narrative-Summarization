Financial highlights
• Annual silver production up 7.1%  
in line with guidance, driven by  
the start-up of phase I at San  
Julián, higher ore grades at Fresnillo 
and Ciénega and an increased  
Silverstream contribution.
• Gold production up 22.8% 
exceeding the revised guidance 
primarily due to the reduction  
of gold inventories at Herradura  
and San Julián phase I start-up.
• San Julián phase I commissioned, 
production already exceeding  
design capacity. 
• Gold and silver resources increased 
8.2% and 10.2%, respectively, gold 
reserves remained stable and silver 
reserves decreased 3.2%.

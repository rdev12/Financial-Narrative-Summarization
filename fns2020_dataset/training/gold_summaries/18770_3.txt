Chairman’s Statement
A strong performance in improving market 
conditions
I am delighted to report a very strong set of 
results for Inland Homes, driven by an increased 
number of plots sold to other developers 
as well as a significant contribution from the 
development and sale of new homes built by 
the Group.
We are conscious that we work in an extremely 
cyclical industry and it is therefore crucial that 
we are ‘in the right place at the right time’.  
Our strategy to extract the maximum value from 
our land bank by building more developments 
ourselves appears to have been well timed 
given the improvement in market conditions and 
the increasing volume of housing transactions 
recorded in the UK.
As a result of this increased activity, total Group 
revenue, which includes revenue from land 
and house sales, rental income and project 
management fees, increased by over 400% to 
£31.12 million (2012: £6.11 million). Gross profit 
was nearly doubled to £7.69 million (2012: 
£3.89 million) with a margin of 24.7% and 
operating profit was up over 370% at  
£5.08 million (2012: £1.06 million). 
Profit before tax was up over 225% at  
£5.21 million (2012: £1.60 million) translating 
into a near fivefold increase in earnings per 
share of 1.98p (2012: 0.41p). 
Net asset value per share increased to 28.7p 
(2012: 27.0p). These financial results exclude 
the future value from the development services 
provided by the Group to DGVL where Inland 
Homes’ profit share is expected to increase 
from the current level of 74% to 90% by the end 
of March 2014 once the outstanding deferred 
consideration of £6.7 million for DGV has 
been paid. The Board anticipates that Inland 
Homes’ share of the future profits from DGV 
should be in the order of £10.1 million net of tax 
which is equivalent to 5.0p per ordinary share. 
Shareholders will appreciate that the unrealised 
profit, resulting from the difference between 
the market and carrying values of the Group’s 
land bank, is significant. The Group finished the 
period with cash reserves of £12.2 million, with 
net gearing reduced to 6.7% (2012: 13.0%).
I am pleased to report that during the period 
DGVL sold 76 plots for a total consideration of 
£5.3 million.
Successful fundraisings strengthen  
capital base
During the year the Group strengthened its 
financial position through two successful  
fundraisings: the first raised £8.94 million net of 
costs through the placement of approximately 
9.35 million Zero Dividend Preference shares 
(“ZDPs”), which have a redemption yield of  
7.3% per annum and will be repaid on or before 
10 April 2019 and the second, in May 2013, 
raised £4.73 million net of costs through a 
placing of approximately 18.3 million ordinary 
shares. These fundraisings have increased the 
Group’s financial flexibility and have strengthened 
the Group’s longer term capital base.
Increased dividend reflects progressive 
dividend policy
At the time of our 2012 results, the Board 
announced its intention to adopt a progressive 
dividend policy. In line with this policy, and 
reflecting these strong results, the Board is 
recommending a fourfold increase in the final 
proposed dividend of 0.27p (2012: 0.067p) 
per share if approved by shareholders at the 
“Inland Homes has had a highly productive 
financial year. The Group is well positioned 
to grow its land bank whilst our expanding 
housebuilding activity will help to ensure 
we maximise the profit potential from the 
Group’s asset base.”

Chairman’s Statement continued
Annual General Meeting which is expected to 
be called for Thursday 5 December 2013. The 
final dividend will be paid on 6 January 2014 
to shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 6 December 2013. The  
ex-dividend date will be 4 December 2013.
Consistent progress against clear  
strategic goals
Our strategy going forward is demanding but 
we believe achievable and is:
1. To increase the size of our land bank year on 
year;
2. Continue the core activity of plot sales to 
other developers to generate cash to fund 
our operations; 
3. Maximise the value from our land bank by 
expanding our housebuilding programme; 
and
4. Maintain borrowings at a relatively low level 
through a strong focus on cash management 
and vendor financing.
The increase in housebuilding will lead to an 
increase in the Group’s net gearing because 
of the increased working capital requirements 
that this entails. However, this is envisaged to 
reduce over time as legal completions of unit 
sales and land disposals are achieved and the 
Board is focused on keeping net gearing under 
control. In this regard the Group has a good 
level of forward sales on both residential homes 
and development land with planning consent.
The number of residential plots in the land bank 
of the Group and those separately held by 
DGVL is currently as follows:
Owned with planning consent 753
Drayton Garden Village 311
Owned or contracted without 
planning consent 300
Plots controlled or terms agreed 942
Total plots 2,306
Well positioned to exploit market 
opportunities
Inland Homes currently has 348 homes under 
construction on seven sites and a further 138 
units are being developed by DGVL. The Group 
is managing the programme of developing 
some of Drayton Garden Village and this  
should further enhance the returns we expect 
from this project. 
Our housebuilding activity has had a strong 
start to the new financial year with 34 
reservations across three active sites since  
1 July 2013. Forward sales for both Inland 
Homes and DGVL either agreed or contracted 
currently stand at £46.3 million.
The Board believes that, for the foreseeable 
future, the market for new homes will remain 
strong in the areas in which we operate, 
particularly in the price range of £160,000 to 
£400,000 where sales are supported by the 
Government’s “Help to Buy” scheme and the 
continuing fundamental shortfall of housing 
availability in the country. As such, we would 
expect a substantial increase in the number 
of units sold in the current financial year when 
compared with 2013.
In addition, we have a strong land pipeline 
with a number of attractive sites in London 
and the south east already secured and are 
experiencing robust demand for land with 
planning consent.
Inland Homes has had a highly productive 
financial year. The Group is well positioned 
to grow its land bank whilst our growing 
housebuilding activity will help to ensure we 
maximise the profit potential from the Group’s 
asset base. Inland Homes is well placed 
to meet the challenges and opportunities 
presented by the market and we look to the 
future with confidence.

Services
We offer business processing, technology and procurement 
services to international customers across multiple industries.  
We understand the challenges our customers face within 
and across these industries. We provide practical, pragmatic 
and powerful solutions for addressing those challenges.
Business processing 
Our business processing services help our customers release 
time and energy that can be dedicated to the things that 
really make a difference to their business. Everything we do 
is designed to deliver measurable business advantage for our 
customers: to optimise the things that are essential for the 
customer’s business to operate – but essentially peripheral to 
its reason for being in business. Our processing assets and 
expertise are applicable to almost any back office function 
and we have particular domain expertise in Insurance 
Services and Financial Services.
We have particular expertise  
in complex and critical business 
processing services. We have 
unique domain knowledge in 
insurance where we process 
policies and premiums, and 
handle claims, and in financial 
services where we handle 
securities processing, investment 
account and fund administration. 
But we are not limited to those 
industries. From telecoms to 
insurance to retail, our people 
have expertise in optimising
business processes across many 
industry sectors and multiple 
service areas. This expertise is 
underpinned with assets and 
resources to support outsourcing 
needs, including an extensive 
offshoring capability. For 
example, 2011 saw collaborative 
working in our Insurance Services 
business between the teams 
in Gurgaon, Folkestone and 
Chatham to support our Lloyd’s 
and London Market customers.
We take complex business processes and simplify them, applying 
Six Sigma principles along with subject matter expertise to deliver 
BPO best practice.
  The sum of all premiums and claims accounting transactions 
processed by Xchanging in 2011 was over £54 billion;
  Xchanging processed over one million premium transactions  
and nearly 750,000 Lloyd’s claim advices in 2011;
  We use our two banking licences to support the provision  
of financial services to our customers.
Technology
By using technology to make systems and processes work 
more easily in the business, we give executives the freedom 
to work more strategically on the business. So technology 
encumbered businesses become technology-enabled 
businesses. We serve more than 300 customers in the UK, 
support 160 brokers and insurers in the commercial insurance 
market globally, and deliver services and systems to some of 
the UK’s national infrastructures. We do all this through three 
complementary business units and increasingly blend our 
business processing and technology expertise in a flexible 
way to provide bespoke solutions for customers. We also 
offer consumption-based services in response to the need for 
‘everything-as-a-service’ solutions that enable customers to 
achieve a variable cost base.
In Technology, we offer 
infrastructure including network-
managed services, software 
products and application 
management services. We also 
offer IT outsourcing services for 
complete technology needs, 
whether of a department,  
a business unit or an entire 
organisation.
We have functional depth in our 
range of specialist insurance 
software products covering the 
full Property & Casualty life-cycle. 
We build, implement and 
support, as needed, end-to-end 
innovative software solutions, 
applicable to even the most 
complex insurance requirements.
The technology support we provide is often critical to the functioning 
of a customer’s business.
  We support the customers of the first nationwide 4G telephony 
and data network;
  Our technology supports the world’s busiest single runway airport;
  We provide end-to-end technology for the insurance market.
Procurement and Other BPO
We help our customers deliver superior procurement 
performance. Our procurement services encompass the 
complete S2P (Source-to-Pay) process including sourcing 
procured goods and services as well as the administrative 
activities that turn a customer demand into a fulfilled and 
paid-for order.
We source in excess of £1.65 
billion of indirect procurement 
spend on behalf of our 
customers. By leveraging our 
supplier relationships and 
applying our trading expertise 
and buying power, we drive 
savings to our customers’ 
bottom lines. 
With an end-to-end portfolio  
of capabilities from knowledge-
based sourcing and spend 
management through to 
transaction-based P2P (Procure-
to-Pay), we ensure that savings, 
policy compliance and cost 
efficiency benefits are embedded 
in the business.
Our top categories of indirect spend are associated with human 
resources and environment spend and they include contract labour, 
travel, telecoms, facilities, workforce, IT and communication, office 
supplies and marketing and professional services.
  We manage 20% of the UK’s outsourced indirect spend,  
making us the second largest provider in the UK. We are the 
fourth largest in the world;
  We operate a flexible range of commercial structures and are 
willing to link our fees to results delivered;
  Our pan-European, Asian and American presence allows us  
to compete as one of only a handful of truly global players in  
this market. Company

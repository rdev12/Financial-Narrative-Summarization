Our ﬁ nancial highlights

A ROBUST 
PERFORMANCE
Robust ﬁ nancial performance in a challenging year

cuts and a softer summer trading environment
– Adjusted underlying operating proﬁ t
2
 was £391m (2009 restated: £415m), only 6% down in a very 
tough year
– Substantial increase in proﬁ ts from Central Europe and Airlines Germany not enough to offset 
UK decline
Outlook
– Well positioned to make progress in the current ﬁ nancial year
1  The Group statutory ﬁ nancial statements for the year ended 30 September 2010 and prior year comparatives are set out on pages 73 to 119.  
2  Underlying proﬁ t from operations is deﬁ ned as earnings before interest and tax, and has been adjusted to exclude all separately disclosed items. It also excludes our share of the results of associates 
and joint ventures. Adjusted underlying proﬁ t from operations is stated before the margin impact of the volcanic ash cloud.
3  The underlying operating proﬁ t margin is the underlying proﬁ t from operations (as above) divided by the external revenue.
4  Adjusted underlying basic earnings per share is calculated as net proﬁ t after tax, but before all separately disclosed items and the margin impact of the volcanic ash cloud, divided by the weighted 
average number of shares in issue during the period.

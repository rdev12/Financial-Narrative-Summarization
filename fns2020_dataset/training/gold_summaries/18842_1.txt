Chief Executive’s review
Results
Operating proﬁt in the Offshore Oil division was sharply 
down reﬂecting the challenging market conditions, as 
maintenance expenditure was severely cut with work 
deferred as a result of the fall in global oil prices. Our other 
three divisions, Specialist Technical, Marine Support and 
Tankships performed strongly, increasing their combined 
underlying operating proﬁt by 25%. The Group’s underlying 
operating margin was 10.4% (2014: 11.6%) and underlying 
earnings per share was 68.5p (2014: 74.0p). The degree to 
which the oil and gas sector postponed maintenance and 
modiﬁcation work was greater than had been anticipated 
or had been experienced in previous cycles. Whilst activity 
levels were severely reduced, gross margins were largely 
sustained reﬂecting the specialist nature of our niche 
services. 
Business model and strategy
The Group’s strategy over the past decade has been to 
grow its marine services through organic growth from 
its niche businesses supplemented by selective bolt-on 
acquisitions to broaden our service and product offering. 
The Group leverages its marine skills to the global market 
focussing on less mature markets. Our businesses are 
entrepreneurially led, with market leading positions through 
operational excellence, delivering operating margins in 
excess of 10%, generating cash and producing a return on 
capital employed in excess of 15%. 
Our strategic goal is to deliver long-term growth in underlying 
earnings per share and progressive dividend growth. The 
compound annual growth rate over the last ten years in 
underlying earnings per share is 12% and the compound 
growth in dividends over the same period is 11%.
“25% combined growth in 
underlying operating proﬁt in 
our Specialist Technical, Marine 
Support and Tankships divisions 
shows the strength of the Group 
and the breadth of sectors in 
which our services are utilised.”

Governance Financial statements Strategic report
The Group provides an extensive range of services to a 
broad range of industries. Our customers are predominantly 
large multinational corporations and government bodies. No 
customer amounts to more than 7% of Group revenue. 
During 2015 the Group completed 5 acquisitions. 
 In February, the National Hyperbaric Centre in 
Aberdeen was acquired for £3.5m. This broadens the 
Group’s offering in hyperbaric testing and consolidates 
JFD’s market leading position in the design, 
manufacture, testing and operation of hyperbaric 
reception facilities. 
 In March, Subtech was acquired for an initial 
consideration of £3.3m. Subtech is based in Durban, 
South Africa with operations in Namibia, Mozambique, 
Tanzania and South Africa. The business provides a 
range of marine services and is well positioned in sub-
saharan Africa for potential growth as offshore projects 
are developed in the future.
 In May, Mojo Maritime was acquired for £3.2m. 
Mojo have considerable experience and reputation 
within the offshore renewables sector providing 
project management, engineering and consultancy 
services. Mojo will be integrated into James Fisher 
Marine Services, the process of which has already 
commenced.
 In May the assets of X-Subsea were acquired for 
£14.8m. X-Subsea had gone into administration and 
were one of the competitors of James Fisher Subsea 
Excavation. This acquisition means we become a 
leading global operator of such specialist subsea tools 
which are used in the oil and gas and telecoms sectors 
and increasingly in the offshore renewables markets.
 A small nuclear sources distributor was acquired in 
January 2015 which has been integrated into James 
Fisher Nuclear.
From an operational perspective, the Group merged 
Testconsult, which was acquired in 2014 with Strainstall 
Monitoring to create James Fisher Testing Services to 
streamline the marketing of our load monitoring, bridge 
monitoring and testing services to the marine and 
construction sectors. James Fisher Subsea Services was 
created to pull together our diving and remotely operated 
vessel inspection businesses.
James Fisher 
Subsea Excavation
Following the acquisition of the assets of 
X-Subsea in May 2015, our existing mass-
ﬂow excavation tools were merged to create 
James Fisher Subsea Excavation (JFSE). 
Our extensive ﬂeet of specialised excavation, 
trenching and dredging tools is employed 
in subsea operations in the oil and gas, 
telecoms and renewable energy sectors. Our 
tools are used in challenging environments 
to prevent damage to pipelines, cables, 
structures and the environment.
In September 2015, JFSE supplied its 
patented T4000 and Twin R2000 mass-ﬂow 
excavation tools to trench and backﬁll two 
500m lengths of a 16” pipeline lying in soft 
silty clay in the Manifa ﬁeld offshore Saudi Arabia. The pipelines crossed through a 300m wide shipping channel. 
JFSE was required to provide as narrow a trench as possible, with a minimum trenching depth of 1.5m top of 
pipe. The project was completed on time and to the customer’s satisfaction well within the estimated number of 
operational hours.  6 Annual Report and Accounts 2015

Marine Support
Revenue in Marine Support increased by 18% in the year 
mainly due to businesses acquired and favourable currency 
movements. After excluding these and the corvette vessel 
management contract which ended in 2014, underlying 
revenue growth was 3% in the year. Underlying operating 
proﬁt increased by 37% to £19.4m with a strong second half 
as businesses acquired in the ﬁrst half contributed and due 
to projects falling into the latter part of the year. Excluding the 
effect of currency movements and businesses acquired, the 
organic growth in underlying operating proﬁt was 7%. 
Ship-to-ship transfers of hydrocarbons increased by 8% in 
volume terms. Despite the backdrop of declining oil prices 
in 2015, underlying revenue increased by around 20% 
compared to prior year. The markets in South East Asia 
and Middle East performed particularly well. Six transfers of 
liqueﬁed natural gas were also completed and we remain 
well positioned for future growth in the medium-term in this 
emerging sector.
Our contract in Angola for mooring and diving services 
performed well in 2015 but will cease early in 2016 reﬂecting 
the different market conditions and customer operational re-
structuring. We are currently in discussions with our customer 
for a managed handover of those operations.
Good progress was achieved in our renewables business 
as we successfully completed the ﬁrst phase of the project 
for Meygen to install a tidal array in the Firth of Forth. Our 
acquisition of Mojo Maritime in May 2015 broadened 
our expertise and experience in tidal and offshore wind 
energy. We continued to provide services to the Offshore 
Transmission (OFTO) operators in 2015.
The recent announcement of the contract with RWE to 
provide an integrated range of marine services to the 
Galloper windfarm project demonstrates the market 
potential in this sector. Worth in excess of £25.0m, the 
contract will commence in the second quarter of 2016 and 
will progressively ramp up during the year and into 2017. 
The project will also utilise our Offshore Wind Management 
System which has been developed as an operational portal 
for the renewables industry. 
Our acquisition of the assets of X-Subsea in May further 
expanded our mass-ﬂow excavation business and we now 
have bases in key locations in the UK, North America, the 
Middle East and Singapore. This business performed well in 
the second half winning pipeline and cable burial and retrieval 
projects in the renewables and oil and gas sectors.
Testconsult, which was acquired in 2014, was merged during 
the year with Strainstall Monitoring to form James Fisher 
Testing Services (JFTS). JFTS saw continued growth in the 
Middle East and Malaysia. In the UK our Bridgewatch
®
 data 
monitoring and asset management system was installed 
onto the new Forth Bridge during 2015 which will provide 
real-time information on the performance of the crossing over 
its lifetime. When the current Forth Bridge was closed after 
a crack was discovered in December 2015, JFTS rapidly 
deployed Bridgewatch
®
 to provide information of the effects 
of wind and trafﬁc loading on the structure. This information 
helped the decision to re-open the bridge two weeks earlier 
than planned.
Offshore Oil
Offshore Oil revenue was 40% lower as inspection, repair 
and maintenance work was deferred more than expected 
following the sharp decline in oil prices. The scale of the 
reduction in maintenance activity and the length of the lull 
in operations were greater than had been experienced 
in previous cycles. The Norwegian market, which had 
previously represented a quarter of the divisional revenue, 
was the most affected with a 37% reduction in revenue. The 
subsea market held up better owing to the longer lead time 
of subsea projects but fewer projects were initiated during 
2015 which will affect 2016. 
The degree of impact varied. Activity in the Middle East, Asia 
and Brazil were less affected, whereas West Africa saw a 
far greater decline in activity. The UK North Sea saw sharp 
declines later in the year but this sector represented a small 
proportion of the division.
Despite the tough market conditions, gross margins held up 
well and were only slightly below prior year. This reﬂects the 
specialist nature of our niche services. We took swift action  Annual Report and Accounts 2015 7

Operational 
Excellence Award
James Fisher Everard (JFE) has been 
transporting clean petroleum products around 
the UK and Irish coasts successfully for over 
50 years. Its ﬂeet of 17 vessels carry fuels 
such as petrol, diesel, kerosene and gasoil 
from reﬁneries and terminals to coastal 
storage facilities in primarily 4,000 metric 
ton (mt) parcels. For many remote locations 
the JFE ships are the only reliable and cost 
effective means of supply such as some of the Scottish Islands and Channel Islands.
Safety and the environment are major concerns to JFE and in 2015 we transported around 3.3 million mt of product 
on over 900 voyages with no Lost Time Injuries to our crew and no spillage of product to the environment. 
Coastal shipping is a tough and unrelenting business which is strictly regulated. JFE operates well beyond the 
required safety standards with high quality vessels and very experienced ofﬁcers. Their excellent safety record 
was marked in 2015 when JFE won the Operational Excellence Award at the annual Tanker Shipping and Trade 
Conference in London. The Award acknowledged the company’s commitment to operational excellence and 
continuous improvement, whilst operating in the challenging coastal waters in North West Europe.
to reduce costs and have reduced headcount by 25% since 
December 2014. Redundancy costs of £1.2m were incurred 
in the year and on-going annual costs have been reduced by 
£3.3m.
2014 had seen one-off product sales of £12.4m by Scantech 
Offshore. If this is excluded, divisional revenue was 28% 
lower. Whilst underlying operating proﬁt reduced by £15.0m 
in the year, the underlying operating margin remained above 
the Group’s benchmark at 11.7% (2014: 21.4%).
Specialist Technical
Revenue grew by 7% and underlying operating proﬁt by 5% 
in Specialist Technical as our diving equipment, defence and 
nuclear decommissioning businesses delivered well against a 
strong order book. 
JFD made good progress on a 24 man saturation diving 
system which will be installed onto a dive support vessel in 
2016 to service Northern Europe and on an 18 man system 
to be installed on a vessel being built in Singapore and which 
will be completed in Baku, Azerbaijan in 2017. A third smaller 
system was commenced in the latter part of the year. Our 
service contracts to provide submarine rescue services for 
the UK, Singapore and Australia continued to perform well.
Delays in the procurement processes for contracts in the 
defence sector dampened growth in 2015 but the company 
remains well placed for further contract awards in 2016 
which will drive future growth.
In February 2015 the acquisition of the National Hyberbaric 
Centre (NHC) in Aberdeen was completed for an initial cash 
consideration of £3.5m. NHC provide hyperbaric reception, 
testing and training services to the subsea industry and this 
further consolidates our industry leading position to the global 
market. 
Our Nuclear business increased revenue by 13% with strong 
growth in decommissioning. This included the ﬁrst phase of a 
purpose built nuclear waste store for Sellaﬁeld. Revenues for 
non-destructive testing services were below the previous year 
as a result of a reduction in workﬂow from the Magnox plants 
and our aerospace customers. The company has begun 
to see revenue from projects outside of the UK and has 
invested in business development for international markets. 
The business has continued to broaden the size and scope 
of projects that it bids for and is well placed for further growth 
in 2016. A small nuclear sources distributor was acquired in 
early 2015 for £2.2m which has performed well following its 
integration into the division. 
Tankships
On 3% lower revenue, our Tankships division increased 
proﬁts by 51% as vessel utilisation increased and operating 
costs were reduced compared to prior year. Volume of 
product transported was slightly higher and on average 
these cargoes were transported over longer distances which 
improved vessel utilisation. The number of vessels in the 
ﬂeet was unchanged in the year and we continued to beneﬁt 
from a contract for two of our vessels which is expected to 
continue through the ﬁrst half of 2016. 
Operating costs beneﬁted from the renegotiation of charter 
rates for vessels introduced to the ﬂeet in 2004/2005. The 
company continues to have an excellent operational safety 
record, which is a credit to all our ofﬁcers and crews at 
sea and to the support team ashore. During the year the 
company was awarded the Operational Excellence Award at 
the annual Tanker Shipping and Trade Conference.
Volumes of clean petroleum product transported through our 
Plymouth port were 3% higher than 2014.

 This has been another record year for the business, resulting 
in an unprecedented increase in profit before all tax of 91% 
to £258.4m (2014: £135.4m) and a significant 27% increase in 
NAV per share to 413.5p (2014: 325.1p). 
It has been a year of major achievement across the portfolio, 
where we have recycled capital through disposals of mature 
assets such as Cranfield University Technology Park into added-
value acquisitions including Kirkby Town Centre purchased off a 
net initial yield of 9% on the main Shopping Centre. 
This was a year in which we brought forward a further 
400,000 sq ft into the commercial development pipeline, 
underlining our ability to secure new opportunities and extract 
maximum value from our 6,000 acre land bank. 
It was also a year during which we established two new 
revenue streams: the first through the management of income 
from student accommodation at the Bay Campus for Swansea 
University by our newly created ‘St. Modwen Student Living’ 
business and the second through delivery of our first two 
developments for the Private Rented Sector (PRS) at Wembley 
Central and Rugby. 
We also saw continued growth of our housebuilding business, 
culminating in an overall profit increase of 21% to £29m 
(2014: £24m), of which St. Modwen Homes contributed £12m 
(2014: £8m) and the Persimmon joint venture* contributed 
£17m (2014: £16m). 
Our achievements in 2015 were exemplified by the completion 
of key milestones across all major projects, making a strong 
contribution to this excellent set of results. Each of these 
projects reflected a specific facet of our business model:
• New Covent Garden Market demonstrated our ability to add 
significant value to brownfield land through our planning skills, 
as we achieved unconditional status in the first half of the 
year, adding a net £127.4m of value to our property portfolio. 
Works to the new market commenced in the second half 
of the year, signifying a major step towards securing vacant 
possession of the 10 acre Nine Elms Square site and we will 
explore our options to either sell, joint venture or develop the 
site during 2016.
“It is extremely pleasing to achieve 
record profits and growth from a year 
of excellent delivery across all areas 
of the portfolio.”

Chief Executive’s Review • As the second phase opened in November 2015, Longbridge 
Town Centre highlighted our skill in generating an increased 
stream of income from our development projects that helps 
to underpin the running costs of the business. Anchored by 
a 150,000 sq ft Marks & Spencer store, the largest in the 
Midlands, and additional retail already leased to a number of 
major national occupiers, the Town Centre will now generate 
£3.2m of annualised income. 
• The Bay Campus developed for Swansea University is a 
prime example of our expertise in cleaning up brownfield 
sites to develop thriving new communities that contribute 
positively to the local and broader economy, whilst delivering 
substantial recurring income and shareholder value. 
We have retained ownership of the income from the student 
accommodation, the first phase of which opened its doors in 
September 2015 housing 917 new students and the second 
phase opened in January 2016. Demonstrating our long-term 
approach to development, the flexibility of our land bank and 
our ability to deliver continued growth, in December 2015 we 
signed a development agreement with Swansea University 
to develop Phase 3 which will be available to new students in 
September 2017 and will bring the total number of student 
rooms to 2,000. 
Strategy overview
We are constantly adding value to our 6,000 acre land 
bank and growing our development pipeline through 
initiatives carried out by our regional teams of property and 
construction experts. 
These initiatives include remediating brownfield land and 
successfully securing planning permissions in order for sites 
to be carefully and sensitively redeveloped. We also keep our 
retained properties, both mature and newly developed, under 
constant review, running them for income for a period of time 
until we take a strategic decision to either their redevelopment 
or disposal. This income stream underpins the running costs of 
the business. 
We are always looking for the next opportunity and actively 
working our land bank at all stages of the development cycle. 
As our major projects reach their peaks, new prospects 
across our regional portfolio are already being identified and 
prepared in order to deliver maximum value for shareholders 
in the future.

As a regeneration specialist, our activities touch many sectors 
of the property market. The way we manage our land bank and 
implement our strategy ensures that we have the flexibility to 
alter our development focus at any time in the economic cycle. 
Our biggest project by value, New Covent Garden Market, is 
located in London but our regional presence in the UK defines 
the business and has done so for the last 30 years. 
Overall, our commitment to the regions has continued to 
produce results during the year. 
Active commercial marketplace 
Our commercial marketplace, predominantly spanning retail 
and industrial space, has fared well with our major projects 
experiencing an exceptional year in terms of delivery and 
income generation. Overall, our programme of commercial 
development is now at 1.6m sq ft and we will continue to add 
new opportunities to the pipeline as schemes complete.
Our programme of speculative space is now at 775,000 sq ft 
for which we have been successful in securing a number of key 
tenants over the last 12 months. We expect this momentum to 
continue in line with current occupier demand. 
We have also secured a number of significant design and build 
projects this year, demonstrating appetite from larger tenants 
for new premises as they expand or relocate. These include 
the Defence Infrastructure Organisation (DIO) which has 
committed to a £32m residential facility for military staff 
working at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM) 
Birmingham, to be delivered at Longbridge and Travis Perkins 
for which we started on site with a 214,000 sq ft regional 
distribution centre in Whitley, Coventry. 
We are experiencing a steady flow of tenant demand for our 
existing space, enabling us to grow our stream of recurring 
income which, in turn, helps to underpin the running costs of 
the business and provides a firm financial footing from which 
we operate. 
Our asset management capabilities continue to deliver strong 
net rental income from our retained development portfolio. 
In particular, the regeneration of Wembley Central, completed 
in March 2015, combines an excellent mix of retail, leisure, 
residential and office space which is now generating an 
annualised net rental income of £2.2m. 
The Company completed or secured a number of acquisitions 
this year for a total value of £95m in order to grow the portfolio 
and extend its development pipeline further. In addition to 
Kirkby Town Centre, other highlights include industrial estates 
at Moorgate Point in Liverpool and Old Mill in Preston. 
The retail market remains competitive across the UK as 
retailers face the challenge of meeting ever-changing customer 
demands in an increasingly crowded space. Nevertheless, we 
have managed to remain successful in this market and have 
created a good level of retailer demand for our schemes which 
are well-located, predominantly mixed-use and therefore offer 
a one-stop-shop for the increasingly busy consumer. 
Strong investment market 
This year saw strong investor interest for commercial property 
which we captured through the sale of a number of our 
mature sites and newly developed assets. This included the 
delivery of three distribution centres, comprising a total of 
189,000 sq ft, for express delivery service DPD (UK) at three 
of our sites across the UK. Demonstrating the appetite within 
the investor marketplace, we disposed of all three assets in 
two separate transactions at the time of tenant occupation at 
yields of 5% and 5.3%.

Chief Executive’s Review (continued) Strong residential market 
The residential part of our business is a core element of our 
strength in the regions. The planning process continues to 
prove challenging nationwide and has presented a delay to 
some site starts during the year. However, across our extensive 
portfolio we have successfully secured over 1,438 homes 
through planning permissions granted in the year.
Demand still remains high for new homes across the UK with 
regional house price inflation surpassing build cost inflation. 
The Help to Buy initiative has contributed positively to sales 
rates, underlining the need for affordable properties to meet 
demand from first time buyers. 
We have continued to grow in this market and remain strong 
in the regions due to our ability to realise development 
opportunities from our own land bank and our skill in adding 
value through planning which enables us to satisfy quickly third 
party housebuilder demand for land. 
Our residential development activities have grown out of the 
Midlands and we are now active across many other parts of the 
UK including the South West, South Wales, the North West and 
in parts of London.
Business outlook
During the next 12 months we will continue to add value 
to the portfolio and realise milestones across our projects. 
New Covent Garden Market will be a particular focus, where 
we will progress towards vacant possession of the 10 acre Nine 
Elms Square site and we will explore our options to either sell, 
joint venture or develop the site during 2016.
Across our commercial portfolio, we anticipate an ongoing 
steady stream of tenant demand. At the same time, our 
development pipeline will continue to be restocked with new 
opportunities as we embark on new speculative schemes and 
design and build projects. 
We expect an equally keen investor market in 2016 and will 
progress with the disposal of those assets from within our 
portfolio which have reached maturity. Similarly, we will remain 
acquisitive, seeking new opportunities to grow our land bank, 
generate more income and ultimately convert into our ongoing 
programme of development. 
We anticipate steady demand for our residential land from 
third party housebuilders. On the development side, we 
anticipate the continued growth of St. Modwen Homes 
which will become more dominant and replace profits from 
the Persimmon joint venture as it draws to its natural close 
by 2018. 
The newly established Income Producing Residential route to 
market will experience further growth as new opportunities 
come on line and as we look for other prospects within our 
own land bank that enable us to enter emerging or existing 
markets, with the aim of continually bolstering levels of 
recurring income. 
Finally, 2016 marks our 30
th
 anniversary as a listed company 
and provides for an opportunity to celebrate the positive 
impact we have made to the UK landscape during this time; 
creating new communities that lead to job creation, helping to 
boost the local, regional and national economy and delivering 
significant shareholder value.

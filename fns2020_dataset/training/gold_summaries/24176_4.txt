SECURITY SERVICES AND 
SYSTEMS (78%)
Market 
G4S operates an integrated security 
business in more than 90 countries  
across the globe. The global security 
market is highly fragmented; there are  
few international suppliers and our 
competitors are typically smaller local  
and regional companies.
Our approach
We design, market and deliver a wide 
range of security and related services and 
our global footprint provides valuable 
access to a highly diversified customer base 
in markets around the world. We aim to 
differentiate G4S by providing industry 
leading security solutions that are 
innovative, reliable and efficient.
Our scale and focus on productivity 
supports our cost competitiveness and  
our sustained investment in professional 
staff, technology, software and systems 
enables us to provide innovative and 
reliable solutions for our customers on  
a stand-alone or integrated basis.
Market 
G4S’s Care and Justice services are 
concentrated in the UK and Australia.
The care and justice market is fairly 
consolidated with a small number of large 
providers. Larger companies are usually 
better equipped to deliver the highly 
specialised services in this sector.
Our approach
G4S will only offer custody, detention, 
rehabilitation and care services where  
we can maintain a qualified talent pool  
and where the political, legal, human rights 
and regulatory framework is consistent 
with our Group values and results in 
acceptable operational, commercial and 
reputational risk.
Market 
G4S Cash Solutions is one of a small 
number of large, global cash businesses  
and is the market leader or number  
two in 41 of its 44 markets. Each market  
is highly regulated, often by central banks, 
and the business requires significant 
infrastructure and expertise. G4S competes 
with local, national and a small number  
of international competitors. Cash usage  
in most developed markets is mature,  
with flat or gradually declining volumes at 
an aggregate market level. Cash usage 
continues to increase in emerging markets.
Our approach
We transport, process, recycle, securely 
store and manage cash and we provide 
secure international logistics for cash and 
valuables. Our strategy is designed to 
enable us to accumulate volumes through 
cost leadership and product and service 
differentiation. T o do this, we invest in 
technology and develop and sell 
proprietary cash management systems 
which combine skilled professionals with 
software, hardware and operational 
support in an integrated managed service. 
We operate around the globe, focusing on 
markets where we are able to build and 
sustain a material market share in our key 
service offerings.

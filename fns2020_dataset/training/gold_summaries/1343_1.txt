 Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2005

Overview
Strong performances by all three of our
divisions drove a signiﬁcant recovery in the
Group’s results. In the US, Sunbelt’s proﬁts
rose 48% on revenues up 15% as it
continued to take market share in improving
trading conditions. In the UK, A-Plant
delivered a near trebling of proﬁts and a
substantially improved return on capital.
Technology is now also beneﬁting strongly
from increased investment in offshore oil
exploration globally with its proﬁts up 26% 
to £3.4m.
For the year to 30 April 2005, Group proﬁt
before tax, goodwill amortisation and, in
2004, exceptional items increased to £25.3m
from £7.6m in 2004 (£6.2m at constant
exchange rates). After goodwill amortisation
and exceptional items, pre-tax proﬁts were
£16.4m compared with last year’s loss 
of £33.1m. Cash tax earnings per share
1
were 7.6p (2004 – 2.4p). After goodwill
amortisation and, in 2004, exceptional items,
and the accounting tax charge, basic earnings
per share were 0.7p in 2005 compared to the
loss of 10.8p in 2004.
The fourth quarter proﬁt before tax, goodwill
amortisation and, in 2004, exceptional items
was £4.4m (2004 – £3.1m). After goodwill
amortisation and exceptional items, the 
pre-tax proﬁt for the quarter was £2.1m
compared with the loss of £10.0m in 2004. George Burnett

Despite an 8% year on year decline in the 
US dollar, Group turnover increased by 4.7% 
to £523.7m and divisional operating proﬁt 
by 52.3% to £67.3m. The underlying growth,
measured at constant exchange rates, was
greater with turnover up 10.4% and
divisional operating proﬁt up 64.0%. 
The Group’s proﬁt margin also improved
signiﬁcantly. The Group’s return on operating
capital employed (excluding goodwill)
increased to 12.6% (2004 – 7.4%).

Cash tax earnings per share comprises earnings before goodwill amortisation, exceptional items and deferred 
tax divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue. Cash tax earnings per share is considered to be a
relevant measure of earnings per share for the Company as the deferred tax liability is not expected to crystallise 
in the foreseeable future. Ashtead Group plc Annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 April 2005

Sunbelt
Sunbelt performed strongly in the year 
with both rental rates and utilisation rising
substantially. Turnover grew 15.4% to
$661.1m (2004 – $572.8m) reﬂecting growth
of approximately 8% in average rental rates
and an increase in average utilisation from
65.1% to 69.0%. There was also a modest
return to growth in its average ﬂeet size,
arising almost entirely from fourth quarter
capital expenditure. Turnover growth was
broadly based with all regions and all major
product areas trading ahead of last year. 
In the fourth quarter, turnover increased
11.5% to $159.5m (2004 – $143.1m), 
a good performance bearing in mind that
quarterly comparatives are now with a 
period last year which had already started 
to beneﬁt from the recovery in non-residential
construction. Rental rates grew 7% in the
quarter. The new proﬁt centres opened in 
the ﬁrst half continued to progress and
further new locations in Miami and Phoenix
were opened in the fourth quarter.
Sunbelt’s turnover improvement reﬂected
market share gains and growth in private
non-residential construction activity (which
rose 5.3% in the year to April 2005 according
to ﬁgures published by the US Department 
of Commerce) as well as the continued shift
from ownership to rental. Sunbelt’s divisional
operating proﬁt was up 16.3% in the fourth
quarter from $20.2m to $23.5m. Sales of
used rental equipment were concentrated 
in the fourth quarter of last year giving rise 
to an unusually high incidence of gains 
on disposal. Excluding this and the lease
capitalisation effect explained below, the
underlying rate of growth in divisional
operating proﬁt was 37.0%. For the year as 
a whole Sunbelt’s divisional operating proﬁt
grew 47.6% to $108.2m representing 
a margin of 16.4% (2004 – 12.8%).
Investments to enhance the network of stores
and the mix of our business continue. The
acquisition of ﬁve stores in the Miami area for
consideration of $1.7m at an EBITDA multiple
of 2.5 times from HSS RentX announced 
in May together with our plan to open
approximately 10 new general tool and
equipment stores across the US on a
greenﬁeld basis in the coming ﬁnancial year
will increase ﬂeet investment in higher return
areas. Additional inﬁll acquisition opportunities
are also under consideration to increase
further our share in attractive markets.
We anticipate strong trading conditions 
in Sunbelt’s key US non-residential market 
in coming years. According to the Dodge
Analytics Division of McGraw-Hill
Construction, a leading industry research
source, US non-residential construction
spending is projected to grow by 6.6%, 
9.5% and 7.3% in 2005, 2006 and 
2007, respectively.
A-Plant
A-Plant has seen signiﬁcant beneﬁts this year
from the programme to refocus its business
completed in January 2004. Although total
turnover for the year rose only marginally 
to £156.3m from £155.9m in 2004, when
2003/4 non-core disposals are excluded, same
store turnover grew by 5.2%. This growth
was achieved despite a ﬂeet size which was
approximately 4.1% smaller than in the
equivalent period last year. Increases in
utilisation from 59.9% to 64.9% and growth
in rental rates of approximately 2% increased
A-Plant’s efﬁciency. The growth in rental rates
in the fourth quarter was approximately 7%.

As a result of these improvements, A-Plant’s
fourth quarter divisional operating proﬁt was
£3.2m, more than double the £1.5m earned
in 2004 and its full year proﬁt virtually trebled
to £11.7m (2004 – £4.0m), representing a
margin of 7.5% (2004 – 2.6%). The initiative
announced earlier this year to increase further
returns through continuing investment in tool
hire equipment is on track with eight
additional locations already carrying the tool
hire range. Over the course of the next 12
months the tool hire range will be introduced
to a further 18 plant locations.
A-Plant’s major account business continues 
to beneﬁt from the breadth of its product
offering and its geographic coverage. As a
result its top 100 customers provided 35% 
of A-Plant’s revenue in the year. New ﬁve-year
contracts were agreed in the year with
Balfour Beatty Utilities Limited, McNicholas plc
and Skanska UK plc, with the latter being a
two-year extension to an existing three-year
agreement. Most recently we have been
awarded a new ﬁve-year sole supply contract
by Birse Group plc for all their plant and tool
requirements. Together these new contracts
are estimated to secure revenues of more
than £50m over the next ﬁve years.
Ashtead Technology
For the year as a whole, turnover grew 9.7%
to £12.4m (2004 – £11.3m) and divisional
operating proﬁt rose 25.9% to £3.4m (2004
– £2.7m). The ﬁrst UK environmental rental
store was opened in Hitchin at the beginning
of the year and the US environmental rentals
expansion continued with the opening of a
new store in Atlanta last October. Both stores
developed well in their ﬁrst year. Ashtead
Technology also substantially improved its
performance in the fourth quarter with
revenues up 45.8% from £2.4m to £3.5m 
in the quarter. The fourth quarter divisional
operating proﬁt increased from £0.5m 
to £1.3m continuing the early signs of 
recovery in its offshore markets seen in 
the third quarter.
Capital expenditure and net debt
Capital expenditure in the year was £157.8m.
This included £32.3m resulting from our
decision to reclassify certain leases (mainly
relating to our delivery vehicle ﬂeet) previously
accounted for as operating leases as capital
leases. Treating these leases as capital leases
increased reported capital expenditure and
ﬁnance lease debt by £32.3m. It also resulted
in the reclassiﬁcation of lease payments of
£7.8m from EBITDA to depreciation (£6.7m)
and interest (£1.4m), thus reducing pre-tax
proﬁts by £0.3m. 
Excluding this lease effect, capital expenditure
rose from £72.3m to £125.5m of which
£120.0m was on the rental ﬂeet. Capital
expenditure was increased signiﬁcantly in the
year to enable Sunbelt to take advantage of
the improving economic conditions in the US.
£27.2m of the ﬂeet expenditure was for
growth with the remainder being spent to
replace existing equipment. Expenditure on 
A-Plant’s rental ﬂeet was also increased from
£29.8m to £35.4m as its performance
improved. Disposals amounted to £37.6m
(2004 – £32.6m) in the year, generating a

proﬁt on disposal of £7.1m (2004 – £5.2m) 
at a margin of 23.2% (2004 – 19.0%). The
markets we use for disposing of used rental
equipment continue to be healthy. In the
coming year capital expenditure is expected
to increase to approximately £160m.
Cash tax payments were again minimal and
are expected to remain so.
On a like for like basis, underlying net debt 
at 30 April 2005 was £467.4m, a reduction
of £59.3m from last year’s £526.7m
principally reﬂecting the pay down of debt
from cash ﬂow generated in the last twelve
months of £53.6m (2004 – £53.6m). This
underlying net debt ﬁgure ignores the 
non-cash impact of the lease capitalisation
discussed above which increased reported
year end net debt by £25.8m to £493.2m.
£82.0m ($156.7m) was available under the
new ﬁrst priority senior debt facility based 
on the April 2005 borrowing base.
EBITDA for the year was £169.7m 
(2004 – £147.0m before exceptional items).
Conversion of EBITDA into net cash inﬂow
from operations was again high at 97.1%
(2004 – 95.2% before exceptional items). 
As a result of both the growth in EBITDA and
the net paydown of debt from cash ﬂow in
the year of £53.6m, the ratio of net debt to
EBITDA improved from 3.6 times a year ago
to 2.9 times at 30 April 2005.
Current trading and outlook
Last year’s momentum has continued into 
the current year. Group turnover for the two
months ended 30 June 2005 was up 12.5%
over the previous year. Sunbelt’s revenues in
dollars rose 17% in the same period.
The capital reorganisation announced today
will provide, when ﬁnalised, a stable and
appropriate long-term platform for the
Group’s future development. It will complete
the renewal of all the Group’s debt facilities
and extend the average debt maturity to
seven years. The Board also expects the
reorganisation will enable it to propose to
shareholders the resumption of dividends 
in respect of the year ending 30 April 2006. 
In the US, the key private non-residential
construction market is strong and is forecast
to remain so. In addition, the shift from
ownership to rental continues. The outlook
for Sunbelt therefore remains encouraging.
Overall, UK markets continue to be stable. 
A-Plant’s focus remains on improving returns
and growing market share. Technology
should beneﬁt from increased investment in
oil exploration and production. Accordingly,
the Board anticipates reporting further
progress in the coming year.

In a turbulent year for 
drug development 
globally, good progress 
has been made in new 
delivery systems.
With	the	commencement	of	the	Quark	
trials,	the	approach	from	a	potential	
licensee	and	the	significant	broadening	
of	the	AtuRNAi
®
	patent	estate,	we	are	of	
the	belief	that	these	opportunities	alone	
could	be	very	significant	relative	to	the	
current	size	of	the	Company.
Overview
In	a	turbulent	year	for	drug	development	
globally,	good	progress	has	been	made	
in	new	delivery	systems.	In	addition,	we	
have	successfully	completed	our	Atu027	
Phase	2a	pancreatic	cancer	trial,	meeting	
its	primary	endpoint.	Despite	good	
technological	advancements,	senior	
hires	and	execution	of	the	research	plan	
could	have	been	more	efficient.	We	are	
committed	to	hiring	highly	motivated	and	
capable	leaders	across	the	organisation	
and	are	aggressively	addressing	this	
issue	in	2016.	
Atu027
The	preliminary	results	of	the	Atu027‑I‑02	
Phase	2a	study	did	not	identify	any	
safety	issues	with	the	combination	of	
Atu027	with	gemcitabine	in	pancreatic	
cancer.	In	addition,	patients	exposed	
to	a	33%	higher	dose	of	Atu027	
(arm 2)	presented	a	longer	median	
duration	of	progression	free	survival	
(PFS):	5.33 months	compared	to	
1.81	months	for	those	on	the	lower	
Atu027	exposure	regimen	(arm	1).	
A	post‑hoc	analysis	of	patients	with	
metastatic	pancreatic	cancer	showed	a	
median	PFS	of	1.61	for	arm	1	vs.	2.89	
months	for	arm	2	(p=0.0247)	which	is	
statistically significant.	
2015	was	a	challenging	year	for	the	
biotechnology	sector	globally	but	a	
significant	one	for	Silence	Therapeutics.	
Modulating	gene	expression	on	and	
off	in vivo	remains	a	difficult	technical	
challenge.	However,	for	the	first	
time	in	its	history,	the	Company	has	
both	a	combination	of	world	leading	
technologies	and	the	balance	sheet	to	
create	a	unique	and	truly	world	class	
biopharma	company.
We	believe	we	are	making	material	
improvements	in	new	delivery	systems	
as	seen	in	the	progress	we	have	made	
in	GalNAc	siRNA	conjugates.	The	
ability	to	mediate	RNAi	in	the	liver	
subcutaneously	as	opposed	to	an	
invasive	intravenous injection	opens	up	
entirely	new	indications	which	were	not	
accessible	to	a	liposomal	system.
In	addition	to	progress	in	delivery,	our	
proprietary	siRNA	chemistry	AtuRNAi
®
	
has	been	strengthened	with	the	granting	
of	a	new	US	patent.	Although	parts	
of	our	patent	estate	start	to	expire	in	
2023,	the	importance	of	our	chemical	
modification	technology	is	being	realised	
as	siRNA	pipelines	are	maturing.	We	now	
expect	to	be	able	to	capitalise	on	our	
intellectual	property	which	was	first	filed	
in	2003.	
Chief Executive’s review
2015 was a difficult year for the biotechnology 
sector globally but a significant one for Silence 
Therapeutics. Silence Therapeutics plc

The	current	analysis,	including	the	follow	
up	data,	showed	that	subjects	in	the	
higher	dosed	arm	(arm	2)	of	the	study	
had	a	median	overall	survival	(OS)	of	
7.79	months	compared	to	5.62	months	
for	the	lower	dose	(arm	1,	p=0.61),	with	
35%	of	patients	being	censored.	For	the	
metastatic	group	only,	the	median	OS	in	
the	higher	dosed	group	was	6.74	months	
compared	to	3.29	(p=0.6)	for	the	lower	
dose	group,	with	26%	of	patients	being	
censored.	
Separately,	the	importance	of	PKN3	in	
metastatic	progression	was	validated	
during	the	period	by	a	third	party	in	
a	peer	reviewed	publication.	Further	
Atu027	preclinical	work	to	optimise	
effective	PKN3	targeting	is	planned	
and	we	believe	that	this	validation	
of	our	target	could	lead	to	business	
development	opportunities.	
Patent award
In	December	2015,	the	Company	was	
granted	a	new	US	patent	(9,222,092).	
This	addition	to	the	Company’s	existing	
patent	portfolio	considerably	strengthens	
its	position	with	far	broader	claims	that	
cover	several	nucleotide	modifications	
at	the	2’	position	and	require	shorter	
modified	stretches	than	claimed	in	our	
previous	patents.	Further	claims	yet	are	
being	sought.	
Since	the	granting	of	this	patent	and	
separately	to	the	above	licensing	
discussions,	the	Company	has	received	
advice	from	three	separate	law	firms	
indicating	that	the	issued	claims	
potentially	capture	other	development	
stage	siRNA	candidates.	
We	have	invited	and	hereby	invite	any	
companies	that	are	developing	modified	
siRNA	candidates	that	fall	within	the	
claims	of	our	patents	to	enter	into	
licensing	negotiations	with	us.
GalNAc conjugation
During	the	period,	Silence	has	increased	
investment	in	conjugation	chemistry.	
In	particular,	substantial	progress	has	
been	made	in	GalNAc	conjugated	siRNA	
for	liver	delivery.	GalNAc	conjugation	
allows	receptor‑mediated	siRNA	delivery	
to	hepatocytes	using	less	complex	
technology	than	liposomal	nanoparticles,	
which	has	the	important	advantage	of	
being	administered	subcutaneously	
rather	than	intravenously.	This	difference	
opens	up	new	therapeutic	areas.	
We	have	obtained	encouraging	functional	
data	using	our	own	linker	design	to	
bind	the	targeting	ligand	(GalNAc)	to	
the	siRNA	cargo:	80%	knockdown	was	
achieved	in	mRNA	levels	of	a	tool	target	
with	a	1mg/kg	dose.	Approximately	
50%	mRNA	knockdown	was	observed	
28	days	after	a	single	dose	of	2mg/kg.	
We	believe	that	the	potency	observed	is	
competitive	relative	to	our	peers.	
In	light	of	this	development,	those	
‘multiple	shots	at	goal’	projects	better	
suited	to	GalNAc	will	be	transitioned	to	
this	technology.	Material	achievements	
in	GalNAc	over	a	short	period	of	time	will	
result	in	the	liver	being	a	major	focus	for	
Silence	going	forward.	Consequently,	we	
are	actively	hiring	experts	in	this	space.	
Liposomal siRNA delivery
Also	in	siRNA	delivery,	our	liposomal	
systems	targeting	the	vasculature	
continue	to	be	optimised	as	we	aim	to	
maximise	potency.	Our	lung	targeted	
system	(DACC)	has	shown	promising	
proof	of	concept	results	in	representative	
mouse	models	of	pulmonary	arterial	
hypertension,	targeting	both	a	validated	
and	a	novel	gene.	In	both	experiments,	
the	therapeutic	benefit	was	measured	
by	a	reduction	in	right	ventricle	systolic	
pressure	(RVSP)	as	well	as	a	reduction	in	
pathologic	pulmonary	vessel	remodelling.	
We	are	committed	to	hiring	highly	motivated	and	capable	
leaders	across	the	organisation	and	are	aggressively	addressing	
this	issue	in	2016.

mRNA therapeutics
The	Company	has	improved	its	mRNA	
delivery	capabilities,	mainly	for	liver	
delivery,	achieving	a	20	fold	increase	
in protein	production	from	the	delivered	
mRNA	cargo	in	mice.	In	addition,	our	
mRNA	technology	has	successfully	
translated	to	higher	species,	showing	
activity	in	NHP.	Progress	in	optimising	
our	mRNA	delivery	capabilities	will	be	
key	to	enabling	both	protein	replacement	
and	gene	editing	applications.	
Initial	in vivo CRISPR/Cas9 studies	
have begun.	
Construct	engineering	is	being	explored	
in	parallel	in	order	to	optimise	mRNA	
stability	and	improve	the	tolerability	
profile.	We	are	actively	investigating	
indications	in	this	area.	
Licensing
Silence	is	pleased	to	announce	the	
progress	of	two	of	our	licensee’s	clinical	
programmes	into	a	pivotal	Phase	3	for	
delayed	graft	function	and	a	Phase	2	for	
acute	kidney	injury.	First	patients	have	
now	been	dosed	and	we	will	be	giving	
guidance	as	to	the	potential	financial	
value	of	these	trials	to	Silence.	
According	to	the	out‑licensing	deal	terms	
and	because	of	Quark’s	arrangements	
with	its	partner	Novartis,	we	believe	that	
Silence	is	now	due	$3m,	equating	to	a	
15%	milestone	payment.	After	numerous	
unsuccessful	attempts	at	resolving	this	
issue	with	Quark,	we	have	decided	to	
instigate	arbitration	proceedings	and	
will	update	the	market	accordingly.	
We remain	confident	of	our	case	but	no	
revenue	has	been	recognised	in	the	year	
due	to	the	uncertainty.
However,	Quark	has	confirmed	in	writing	
that	it	will	honour	its	financial	obligations	
to	Silence	should	both	these	trials	come	
to	a	successful	conclusion.	Silence	
is	entitled	to	15%	of	all	sub‑licence	
revenues	from	Novartis.	In	2010,	Quark	
announced	potential	milestones	of	up	to	
$650m	from	Novartis	beyond	the	$30m	
already	received.	Silence’s	direct	licence	
with	Quark,	in	the	absence	of	Novartis,	
sets	out	milestones	of	up	to	€2.5m	on	
approval	and	launch,	with	royalties	
of 4%.
After	initial	discussions	in	2013,	the	
Company	has	again	been	approached	
by	a	US	company	for	a	licence	for	a	
clinical	product.	As	in	the	case	of	Quark,	
the	licence	is	for	the	use	of	the	critical	
chemical	modifications	of	AtuRNAi	to	
enable	the	safe	transit	of	the	siRNA	into	
a	target	cell.	We	continue	to	discuss	
terms	with	this	company.	In	light	of	the

Board changes and 
Technology Advisory Board
Lars	Karlsson	stepped	down	as	
Head of Research	from	the	Board.	
Silence	is	seeking	a	new	Head	of	
Research,	which	is	a	challenging	task	in	
a	highly	specialised	field	such	as	RNA	
therapeutics.	In	the	meantime,	while	we	
identify	the	ideal	candidate,	we	are	in	
the	process	of	setting	up	a	Technology	
Advisory	Board.	This	Board	will	consist	
of	highly	experienced	executives	from	
pharma	and	biotech	with	specific	
knowledge	in	RNA	therapeutics.	It	is	
envisaged	that	this	Board	will	regularly	
convene	with	senior	scientists	from	
within	the	Company	to	assist	in	the	
implementation	of	the	research	plan	
that	is	currently	being	executed.	
Two members	of	this	team	have	already	
been appointed.	
Dr	Stuart	Collinson	resigned	from	the	
Board	due	to	an	unexpected	increase	
in	his	commitments	to	Arcturus	
Therapeutics	and	other	companies	with	
which	he	is	working.	Both	Dr	Collinson	
and	the	Board	expressed	their	regret	
that	he	was	unable	to	remain	on	the	
Silence Board.	
The	Company	will	seek	to	make	a	
further	non‑executive	appointment	to	
the	Board	and	continues	to	look	to	hire	
the	highest	calibre	non‑executives	with	
specific	expertise	in	different	areas	of	
the business.
Outlook 
Silence	Therapeutics	remains	one	of	the	
global	leaders	in	RNA	therapeutics.	We	
have	made	significant	strides	in	making	
the	technology	behind	the	platform	more	
reproducible	and	robust.
A	recruitment	drive	in	the	translational	
science	team,	focusing	on	liver	
indications,	will	transition	the	Company	
from	technology	to	products.	With	
the	strength	of	our	balance	sheet	to	
support	the	breadth	of	our	platform,	
we	look	forward	to	the	future	with	great	
confidence.

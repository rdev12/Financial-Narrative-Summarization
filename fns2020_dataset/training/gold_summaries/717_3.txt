CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
“Recruiting and retaining 
world-class team members 
are key to our success.”
The last financial year has been a 
year of considerable success for 
Manpower Software, one in which 
we have further delivered on our 
strategy to be the leading supplier 
of workforce optimisation solutions 
in our chosen markets. Despite the 
economic downturn, Manpower 
Software has strengthened its 
position, both financially and in 
market share. 
RESul TS
Revenue in the financial year was 
£11.6m (2007: £8.3m), an increase 
over last year of 39%. Trading profit 
for the year, before adjustments 
for share-based payments and 
amortisation of intangible assets, 
was £1.85m (2007: £1.07m), an 
increase over last year of 73%. The 
resulting net operating margin was 
16% (2007: 13%). Cash balances at 
the year-end increased to £4.3m 
(2007: £2.4m).
SIgNIFICANT ACTIvITy
In addition to the Company’s best 
ever financial results, a number of 
significant milestones were also 
achieved during the year:
23 new NHS Trusts became  
customers, up from 10 new 
signings in the previous year. 
Since the year-end, a further  
7 contracts have been closed;
The acquisition of Key  
Information Technology 
Systems Limited (“Key ITS”) 
established our position in 
the NHS temporary staffing 
solutions market and brought 
with it 90 new sites, each of 
which is a potential customer 
for MAPS Healthroster; 
Three new partnership  
agreements were signed: ACS 
Healthcare Solutions (USA), 
PricewaterhouseCoopers 
(PwC) (UK) and Singapore 
Technologies Electronics Ltd 
(Singapore), thus expanding 
the Company’s capabilities in 
these markets.
We continue to combine a resolute 
focus on the four core financial and 
structural elements of a successful 
software business, with rapid 
commercial development:
linearity of licence revenue  
growth through consecutive 
periods 
strong margins in services and  
support revenues
investments directed only in  
high productivity activities
diligent expense management 
linearity of licence revenue 
Healthcare is now Manpower 
Software’s largest market. 
During the year the Company 
took on a further 23 new NHS 
Trust customers for its powerful 
e-rostering solution, thus 
providing a steady flow of licence 
revenue. In addition, Manpower 
Software has entered the current 
financial year (ending 31 May 2009) 
with a strong pipeline of further 
opportunities within the NHS. 
Since the year-end, a further 
7 contracts have been closed.
Strong margins in service  
and support revenues
Revenues from services and 
support continued to form a 
substantial part of our business 
and grew by 29%, delivering strong 
operating margins across the 
financial year.
Investments in high  
productivity activities
Monitoring performance and 
using appropriate incentive 
structures throughout the 
Company have helped to drive 
increased revenues and operating 
margins. The acquisition of Key 
Information Technology Systems 
Limited provides an additional 
source of recurring revenue, 
which will enable the Company to 
consolidate its increasing presence 
in the NHS. 
“There is a strong sales pipeline 
and the capability to deliver 
profitable growth. Despite the 
global economic climate, the 
Directors believe the Company 
is well positioned for another 
successful year.”
“We continue to 
combine a resolute 
focus on the four  
core financial and 
structural elements  
of a successful 
software business.”

diligent expense management
The Company ensured that G&A 
expense was kept to a minimum 
and investments in sales and 
marketing, services and support, 
and R&D were each carefully 
managed. This complemented 
the effort to grow revenues and 
enabled the Company to deliver 
improved operating margins across 
the business.
Achievements with each of these 
important structural aspects 
have ensured the Company’s 
profitability across all parts of its 
business, while also achieving 
exceptionally high levels of 
customer satisfaction.

The Company has prepared these 
results in accordance with the 
recognition and measurement 
principles of IFRS in issue and as

The adoption of IFRS does not 
result in any material changes to 
the Group’s accounting practices, 
although the policy framework 
under IFRS has changed. There 
are no adjustments to the income 
statement as a consequence 
of the first time adoption of 
IFRS, and there are no material 
differences between the cash 
flow statement presented under 
IFRS and the cash flow statement 
presented under UK GAAP. 
OuTlOOk
The result for 2008 was 
excellent and the outlook  
for 2009 is for a further year  
of progress. 
Across all sectors of the business, 
the following essential elements 
are in place to drive continued 
growth in 2009:
Strategic vision.   Our vision 
remains fixed upon being the 
world’ s foremost leader of 
workforce optimisation solutions 
in our chosen markets, thereby 
enabling our customers to 
achieve effective and efficient 
use of their most important 
resource: their people.
Customer satisfaction.   The 
strongest sales multiplier 
we have is referenceable 
customers. We will not deviate 
from maintaining a high level of 
customer satisfaction in each of 
our chosen markets in order to 
achieve further referenceable 
sites and a  
high level of individual 
customer satisfaction.
Integrated software platform.  
We offer our customers an 
integrated software platform 
that meets the full range of 
their business needs across 
our core strength areas of 
workforce management, 
workforce scheduling, 
workforce planning and 
workforce analysis.
Multiple growth drivers.   Our 
MAPS software solution lends 
itself to other vertical and 
geographical markets and, 
based upon our assessment 
of their potential, we plan to 
add markets to our portfolio. 
In addition to growing our 
direct sales and services 
teams, we intend to expand 
our capacity by the increasing 
use of strategic partnerships. 
These will enable us to extend 
our penetration of existing 
geographical markets and 
reach new territories.
Profitability.  We are highly 
focused on achieving profitable 
growth and positive cash flow, 
which will enable us to invest 
in new products and resources 
that advance our strategic 
vision.
A committed team.  From 
product development to sales 
and marketing, and through 
to customer service, we are 
committed to delivering 
the highest quality product 
solutions to our customers. 
Recruiting and retaining world-
class team members is key to 
our success.
Management has established 
firm foundations for continuing 
profitable growth. Following the 
successful integration of Key ITS, 
we are looking to acquire further 
complementary businesses that 
are synergistic and earnings 
enhancing. There is a strong sales 
pipeline and the capability to 
deliver profitable growth. Despite 
the global economic climate, the 
Directors believe the Company 
is well positioned for another 
successful year.
I would like to thank our customers 
for their business, enthusiastic 
use of our workforce optimisation 
solutions and unstinting support 
for our growth strategies. Finally, I 
would like to recognise and thank 
Manpower Software’s employees 
for their unbounded commitment, 
energy and enthusiasm for the 
Company’s success.

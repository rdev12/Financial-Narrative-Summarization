These tables and charts show the highlights of BP’s achievements
in 2004. They reflect more than our financial performance. Our
strong profitability has allowed us to increase the dividend year on
year, and we are continuing to invest in the future. Environmental
and safety performance remains a key focus. We continue to
make significant financial commitments in the communities in
which we operate.
In this Report, BP presents pro forma results in addition to
its reported results, to enable shareholders to evaluate better
our performance against that of our competitors. The pro forma
result is replacement cost profit excluding acquisition amortization
as defined in footnote 
b
to the reconciliation table (below). 
Both the pro forma result and replacement cost profit include
exceptional items and non-operating items as defined in 
footnote 
a
to the reconciliation table (below). The pro forma 
result has been derived from our UK GAAP accounting
information but is not in itself a recognized UK or US GAAP
measure. BP will discontinue pro forma reporting at the time it
adopts International Financial Reporting Standards with effect
from the first quarter of 2005. References within BP Annual
Report and Accounts 2004 to ‘result’ are to pro forma results.
References to ‘capital employed’, ‘operating capital employed’
and ‘net debt plus equity’ are to these measures on a pro forma
basis that excludes the fixed asset revaluation adjustment and
goodwill consequent upon the Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO)
and Burmah Castrol acquisitions in 2000. ‘Return’, ‘return on
average capital employed’ and the ‘net debt ratio’ (net debt/net
debt plus equity) refer to ratios calculated using these measures.
The financial information for 2003 has been restated to reflect
(a) the transfer of natural gas liquids (NGLs) operations from
the Exploration and Production segment to Gas, Power and
Renewables on 1 January 2004; (b) the adoption by the group
of Financial Reporting Standard No. 17 ‘Retirement Benefits’
(FRS 17) with effect from 1 January 2004; and (c) the adoption
by the group of Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract No. 38
‘Accounting for ESOP Trusts’ with effect from 1 January 2004.

Replacement cost profit for the period includes the net profit or loss on the sale of fixed assets and businesses or termination of operations. It also includes non-
operating items identified by the group, primarily asset write-downs/impairment, environmental and other provisions and restructuring, integration and rationalization
costs. These items do not meet the criteria to be classified as operating exceptional items.
b
Acquisition amortization refers to depreciation relating to the fixed asset revaluation adjustment and amortization of goodwill consequent upon the ARCO and Burmah
Castrol acquisitions. The results for 2003 and 2004 include accelerated depreciation of the revaluation adjustment in respect of the impairment of former ARCO assets
of $381 million and $214 million, respectively. BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004

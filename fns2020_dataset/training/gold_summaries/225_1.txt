Strategic report 
(incorporating the CEO’s strategic and operational review)
Business overview
Companies are more dependent than ever 
on IT to run their businesses and as a result 
their IT infrastructures are exposed to an 
unprecedented level of risk. IT risk is typically 
introduced through significant IT trends 
(external factors) or when delivering against 
specific business objectives or projects 
(internal factors). 
Examples of external IT trends include cybercrime, 
consumerisation, cloud computing, social 
media technology integration and the “internet 
of things”. Examples of specific internal business 
objectives or projects include reducing costs, 
doing more with less, adhering to compliance 
and enhancing customer experience. 
The most widely reported external IT trend tends 
to be cybercrime because it presents a 
significant risk and has affected a number of 
high profile organisations. Recently reported 
industry figures (source: hackmageddon.com 
and Deloitte) show that: 
  cybercrime continues to grow at an 
unprecedented level with a 118% increase 
in the number of new malware samples 
created in 2013;
  62% of attacks on organisations were 
motivated by cybercrime;
  the UK consistently appears in the top 
five countries receiving cyber attacks; 
  in a survey of specific UK companies, 
93% were attacked and had on average 
62 attacks per annum; and 
  the annualised cost of cybercrime to the 
companies surveyed in 2013 was just 
under £3m and ranged from £378k to 
£17m – an increase of 42% on 2012. 
Whether IT risk is introduced via an external 
or internal factor the issues that need to be 
managed can be broken down into six 
broad categories: 
  availability – ensuring core systems and 
network services are always up and running;
  performance and visibility – ensuring resources 
are optimised and centralised platforms are 
in place for rapid response and investigation 
in the event of a problem;
  security – ensuring that bad things are kept 
out and important things are kept in;
  compliance and governance – ensuring 
adequate controls and evidence collection 
are in place for auditors and internal 
risk registers;
  in-house expertise – ensuring that there 
is access to knowledgeable and rare 
resources; and 
  supply chain – assurances that the company 
supply chains have an appropriate level 
of protection and compliance in place.
Our results reiterate the strength of our business, 
strategy and the market we operate in.
Accumuli is no ordinary company – we are real 
experts at what we do with highly skilled people 
and premium services.”

Strategic report
How do we help?
It is becoming increasingly difficult for 
organisations to manage IT risks due to volume 
and variety – consequently organisations are 
increasingly turning to an independent specialist, 
such as Accumuli, to help them understand, 
design and implement the right levels of 
protection and management. 
Accumuli is a leading, UK-based independent 
specialist in IT Security and risk management 
– we help organisations manage IT risk by 
ensuring their IT infrastructure is available, 
performing and visible whilst always being 
compliant, resourced and secure. Accumuli 
delivers this outcome through a portfolio of 
premium solutions and services and a culture 
that is focused on our customers and teamwork. 
Accumuli is no ordinary company – we are 
real experts at what we do with highly skilled 
people and premium services. We offer true 
end to end solutions for our customers who 
are looking for a technically and commercially 
advanced partner that will truly help them – our 
value add is reflected in our high levels of gross 
profit, recurring revenues and customer renewals.
Our portfolio 
The “Accumuli Security Framework” explains 
our approach to working with our customers. 
In simple terms it can be broken down into 
three parts: Support and Managed Services, 
Professional Services and Technology Solutions.
1 Support and Managed Services 
We provide value added vendor support 
and a managed service platform that enables 
companies to outsource the management 
of their security technologies. In the areas of 
managed and hosted services the acquisition 
of Signify significantly enhanced our capability. 
Additionally the steps we have been taking to 
adopt best practice through the ITIL framework 
and the recruitment of Andrew Cooke as director 
of operations continued to demonstrate our 
commitment to the importance of this part of 
the business. Andrew Cooke was appointed 
as director of operations in October 2013 
and has a background of over 20 years in 
operational IT management with particular focus 
on service delivery of managed services. Andrew 
recently fulfilled the same role for a managed 
security services business in the UK and has 
had an immediate impact since joining us. 
2 Professional Services
To ensure that technologies are implemented 
correctly our customers require assistance 
with the scoping, design, implementation 
and training of technology solutions. Our 
customers call upon the skills, knowledge 
and expertise of the Accumuli team valuing 
the professionalism and insight we provide. 
Whilst the smallest, but with growing revenues, 
of our three segments this is the most important 
in terms of our credibility as a business.
3 Technology Solutions 
We currently represent 27 leading technology 
vendors which means that we can provide 
truly independent advice to our customers and 
recommend the most appropriate technologies 
to meet their risk and budget objectives. The 
technology vendors are split into strategic, 
tactical and emerging partners with the majority 
of our revenue coming from those in the 
strategic vendor category. 
From a customer perspective, our solutions 
are split into four areas (“Centres of Excellence”): 
  core network services and network 
automation;
  Big Data platforms and performance analytics;
  defence in depth; and
  security analytics and threat intelligence.
In each of these areas we are focused on 
ensuring we retain thought leadership on the 
technologies and business drivers. With each 
of the acquisitions we have made in the last 
four years, the acquired business was very 
clearly the expert in its niche. We continue to 
aim to identify the “right” third party technologies 
for our clients, whilst also supplementing them 
with some of our own.
The market and competitive landscape
We continue to operate in a market with good 
growth prospects and significant historical 
spend. Gartner report that the worldwide 
IT Security market is worth in excess of $62bn 
per year with the UK valued at $3.6bn a year. 
However, the sector is highly fragmented in 
terms of products and services so we look at 
the growth projections (compound actual and 
future annual growth rates) of the areas that 
are relevant to our offerings – quite often the 
projections are global rather than just the UK: 
  General IT Security services  7% 
and products
  Managed and hosted IT 13% 
Security services
  Core network services  15% 
and network control 
  Big Data platform and  20% 
performance analytics
The growth of Big Data is unsurprising given 
the ability to now access and analyse large 
quantities of data in real time across an 
organisation’s entire IT assets. This level of 
intelligence and visibility enables companies 
to proactively monitor and manage threats 
to their business and leverage value from 
machine data. 
The competitive landscape is typically made 
up of three types of companies: 
  small/niche specialists that specialise in 
one particular solution or service but with 
limited scope to expand due to cash flow 
or people;
  mid-range independents who differentiate 
based on breadth of portfolio, capability 
and customer base; and
  large system integrators and service 
providers (typically an operating division 
or a large outsourcer) that tend to be 
generalists by nature and focus on 
servicing needs of large multi-national 
customers – they quite often require a 
sub-contractor to obtain specific expertise. 08 Accumuli plc Annual report and accounts 2014
Strategic report
Strategic report continued
(incorporating the CEO’s strategic and operational review)
The market and competitive landscape 
continued
There was, and remains, a market opportunity 
for a specialist to become the sub-contractor 
of choice to large systems integrators and 
service providers and be the strategic supplier 
of choice to organisations with more than 
3,000 employees, something that is certainly 
part of our goal. 
Our strategy
Our strategy is made up of three key 
components: 
1  identify, acquire and integrate acquisitions 
that add both strategic and financial value;
2  achieve organic growth through selling 
existing solutions and services to existing 
customers; and
3  partner with strategic alliances for 
mutual benefit. 
1 Acquisitions 
A further two acquisitions were made in the year 
taking the total to six acquisitions and one 
disposal since the group’s inception. The 
acquisitions made during the year contributed 
23% of group revenues and 29% of gross profit 
reflecting the service-rich mix of revenues in 
the acquisitions we made.
  Signify was acquired in June 2013. 
The business was attractive to us due to 
its high levels of recurring revenues and 
customer retention, a customer base of 
282 organisations, a highly skilled team 
of people and a proposition that added 
value to our overall solutions and 
services framework. 
  Given the growing mobility of today’s 
workforce, it is becoming increasingly 
important for all organisations to offer 
employees secure remote access to 
systems and information. Therefore, adding 
two-factor authentication to our managed 
services offering represented the next 
logical step in our value proposition to help 
customers secure their business and 
reduce operating costs.
  Eqalis was acquired in December 2013. 
The business was attractive to us as its 
portfolio complemented our security and 
incident management (SIEM) solutions; it 
is Splunk’s leading partner having won the 
UK, Africa and Ireland partner of the year 
award for the last two years; and it is the 
only Splunk authorised training provider 
in the UK with a customer base of over 
150 well-known brands. 
  Big Data analytics is now intrinsically linked 
with security and operational excellence 
and Eqalis has been addressing these 
challenges and delivering great results to 
its customers for the last six years. The key 
to successfully mitigating IT Security threats, 
detecting incidents and responding to 
breaches is the ability to access and analyse 
large quantities of data in real time across 
an organisation’s entire IT assets. This level 
of intelligence and visibility enables companies 
to prioritise actions, respond to incidents, 
improve processes and enhance controls. 
Since the year end we have completed a small, 
bolt-on, tactical acquisition of a specialised 
reseller of IT security, ArmstrongAdams Limited, 
which was done to enhance our product offering 
in this area. The net initial cash consideration 
for this deal was nil and there is contingent 
consideration payable over two years based 
on the trading performance of the business. 
The vendor will remain with the business and 
we anticipate that we will pay £0.8m of contingent 
consideration in total which will be payable 
half yearly.
Acquisition integration
Accumuli is one company with one strategy 
and one team. In order to ensure that 
acquisitions are integrated properly and that 
there is no duplication of activities, the entire 
company has been organised around four 
key disciplines which enables us to align 
resources, systems and processes. 
The core disciplines are: 
  customer intimacy; 
  product and thought leadership;
  operational excellence; and
  financial power.
There is one executive responsible for each 
core discipline and together they make up 
the management team, namely Rick Wilkinson 
(customer intimacy), Jon Inns (product and 
thought leadership), Andrew Cooke (operational 
excellence) and Ian Winn (financial power). 
In addition to the core disciplines there is 
great importance placed on the Accumuli 
culture and values during and after an 
acquisition. Having a strong sense of identity 
and being able to assess whether a company 
will fit into that environment is a critical factor 
for ensuring ongoing performance. 
Experience has taught us that driving the right 
company culture can have a dramatic effect 
on our experience as employees, customer 
satisfaction and business performance. It is 
important for Accumuli to understand (and 
state) the type of culture that we want to 
have so that we can recruit and retain the 
right individuals and establish an appropriate 
balance between delivering company growth 
and looking after our employees. 
Values underpin any culture and they are a 
promise to each other (and our customers) 
as to how we will work together as a team – 
the interaction between all parties is crucial 
to a constructive environment. Having clear 
values also helps us to recruit and retain 
the right individuals. 
The Accumuli culture and values are openly 
stated and assessed every six months.

Strategic report
2 Organic growth strategy
Accumuli focuses its sales and technical 
resources on selling existing solutions and 
services to existing customers. Accumuli 
currently has 704 customers of all sizes which 
span a range of industry sectors including 
financial services, utilities, telecommunications, 
manufacturing and government. At present 
85% of customers take only one product from 
Accumuli, indicating the potential to “retain 
and penetrate” the existing customer base. 
Our primary focus on selling to the existing 
customer base is supported by research 
which indicates: 
  it costs five times more to acquire new 
customers than it does to keep current ones;
  reducing churn by 5% can increase profits 
by between 25 and 125% over four years;
  80% of future revenue will come from just 
20% of customers; and
  the probability of selling to an existing 
customer is 60–70% versus 5–20% for 
a new prospect.
There are currently 19 people focused on 
retaining and penetrating customers which 
represents 23% of the employee base. 
3 Strategic alliances
There are three types of strategic partners that 
Accumuli works collaboratively with: 
  value added resellers that promote and sell 
the Signify hosted two-factor authentication 
solution for which they receive a margin 
in return; 
  system integrators that sub-contract 
professional services work to Accumuli 
due to our expert resources; and 
  service providers that sub-contract managed 
services to Accumuli so that they can utilise 
our 24x7 Security Operation Centre.
Accumuli currently has 36 strategic alliances 
with partners and we are seeing more 
demand in this area due to our levels of 
expertise and reputation in the market. 
Accumuli acquired Signify Solutions Limited, a managed service 
provider of secure authentication in June 2013. 
Signify fits closely with Accumuli’s existing portfolio of helping customers 
secure their business through a combination of technology, professional 
services and managed services whilst adding 2FA capability. This synergy 
will allow Accumuli to promote and cross-sell Signify’s authentication 
services to its wider client base and vice versa. 
Accumuli acquired Splunk’s leading UK partner Eqalis in December 2013 to 
complement the company’s security incident and event management (SIEM) 
solutions and strengthen its Big Data monitoring and analytics capabilities. 
Eqalis provides solutions that enable organisations to gain visibility 
of data across the complete IT estate, including monitoring, managing 
and delivering actionable intelligence on security and operational risks. 
The company is the UK’s leading Splunk partner, having won the UK, 
Africa and Ireland partner of the year award twice, and the only Splunk 
authorised training provider in the UK. In addition, Eqalis is a leading 
partner for Prelert, Puppet Labs and App Dynamics, which assist 
enterprises with anomaly detection, system change, application 
and infrastructure performance management. 
Both acquisitions are in line with Accumuli’ s strategy of acquiring organisations 
that complement the group’ s existing expertise and capabilities.

Operational performance
In reporting on the year it is useful to consider 
not just the quantitative analysis, which is 
detailed elsewhere within this report, but to 
look at some of the operational highlights 
during the year.
Operational highlights
  Strong sales in Core Network Services, 
including two deals worth in excess of £1m, 
one with a leading mobile service provider 
and one with a leading gaming business
  Large managed service contract win 
with a major high street bank for Core 
Network Services 
  Record sales in Big Data Platforms and 
Performance Analytics (Eqalis acquisition) 
in the final quarter of the year which reflects 
the strong market opportunity 
  Largest quarter in a 13 year history in Q4 
for the two-factor hosted authentication 
platform for Signify 
  Substantial cross-sell achieved into a 
leading gaming business which means 
they now take solutions and services from 
all of our centres of excellence, demonstrating 
the potential for cross-selling
  Six figure managed service contract win for 
SIEM with a leading bank, replacing one of 
our key competitors
  Largest number of professional services 
days sold in the company’s history with 
our bank of days now sitting at 1,000 
versus 600 at this time last year
  Continued investment in and development 
of our technical staff with over 35% of the 
workforce securing a professional 
accreditation or qualification in the year
  Continued levels of high customer retention
  ISO27001 audits successfully passed 
across all offices in Basingstoke, 
Cambridge and Leeds
Public recognition
Finally, in reflecting on the financial year, 
Accumuli received and was nominated 
for several awards including: 
  named as one of the finalists in the Best 
Managed Security Service category for 
SC awards Europe;
  named as one of the UK’s 1,000 most 
exciting and inspirational companies in 
research compiled on behalf of the 
London Stock Exchange;
  shortlisted for Tech Achievement 
of the Year at the UK tech awards; 
  shortlisted for Specialist Reseller of the 
Year at the CRN channel awards;
  nominated and deemed eligible for the 
Deloitte UK Fast 50 programme;
  winner of the Best Remote Access 
Security Solution at the SC Magazine 
awards Europe; and 
  CEO named in the CRN A-list of top 
industry executives. 
It is always flattering to receive any nomination or 
award and is further affirmation that the business 
continues to move in the right direction.
Summary
As with last year, our challenge is to continue 
to develop and accelerate at the pace we 
have achieved for the first 40 months of our 
existence as Accumuli Security. 
We are in a growth market with a growing 
reputation and a premium value proposition that 
continues to meet our customers’ needs. Our 
success will be down to our ability to execute 
against our strategy and to scale, recruit and 
retain our staff and maintain our culture. 
We have a truly great team at Accumuli and 
I am proud of the company we have built 
so far. I look forward to building on our solid 
foundations and delivering continued success 
in the current year.

 OVERVIEW
FOR THE YEAR TO 31 MARCH 2015
The financial data presented in the Overview and Strategic 
report is taken from the Investment basis financial 
statements. The Investment basis is described on page 33 
and the differences from, and the reconciliation to, the IFRS 
Audited financial statements are detailed on pages 33 to 37 .
The key measures of total return and NAV are equal under 
both bases.
TOTAL RETURN  
ON EQUITY
20%
The strong performance across all three 
businesses generated an increase in NAV  
per share to 396p (2014: 348p).
PRIVATE EQUITY
REALISATION PROCEEDS
£831 m
CASH INVESTED
£369 m
Good investment returns of 24% were driven 
by strong earnings growth and realisations 
which generated a 27% uplift over opening 
value (excluding refinancings).
We continued to invest selectively, focused 
on our core sectors and expertise, and 
committed £369m, of which £328m was 
in four new investments.
INFRASTRUCTURE 
GROSS INVESTMENT RETURN
20%
CASH INCOME
£47 m
Gross investment return of £96m benefited 
from a total shareholder return of 25% 
delivered by 3iN, which was driven by the sale 
of Eversholt Rail and value uplifts across the 
Core infrastructure portfolio.
AUM growth and strong investment 
performance led to a 4% increase in advisory 
fee and dividend cash income to £47m.
DEBT MANAGEMENT 
AUM RAISED
£2.4bn
FEE INCOME
£34m
Active fundraising with six new CLOs closed, 
a €250m first close on our European Middle-
Market Loan Fund and a further $78m of  
AUM added to our US Senior Loan fund.
Fee income improved by 6% to £34m 
(2014: £32m) following the 12% growth  
in AUM.
ASSETS UNDER  
MANAGEMENT (“AUM”)
£1 3.5bn
AUM increased by 4% to £13.5bn  
(2014: £12.9bn) as the ongoing fundraising 
momentum in Debt Management offset the net 
divestment seen in Private Equity. 
OPERATING CASH  
PROFIT
£28m
Cash income grew by 20% to £158m, due to 
the 12% growth in Debt Management AUM, 
improved portfolio income cash generation in 
Private Equity and dividend proceeds from 3i 
Infrastructure plc (“3iN”).
Demonstrating the improved operational 
efficiency in the business, income exceeded 
costs by £28m (2014: £5m).

 Highlights
We delivered a successful first year in the turnaround phase of our 
strategic plan. The results were characterised by a 129% increase in 
adjusted earnings per share that were driven primarily by the 56% 
increase in underlying adjusted operating profit. The £7.2m current  
year cash cost of the capacity reduction project was self-financed  
with only a small rise in net debt.

Executive summary 
The year was marked by a number of 
significant achievements in the first 
phase of our turnaround plan. Our focus  
has been on self-help measures and 
these have delivered a 56% increase in 
underlying adjusted operating profit  
in the current year whilst laying strong 
foundations for further growth in the 
new financial year. 
The complex project to reduce excess 
capacity in our Chain division saw 
completion of the closure of the  
Bredbury facility soon after the end of  
the financial year. Whilst project activity  
at the recipient sites continues during  
the first quarter of the new financial year, 
we expect to deliver three quarters of the 
annualised savings of £3.2m in the new 
financial year.
The underlying revenue picture was  
mixed across the world with local 
macro-economic conditions being the 
principal drivers of the overall 1.6% fall. 
The Americas and India both delivered 
good growth while European economies 
were mixed with the net revenue result 
being broadly flat. Underlying Australasian 
revenues were down 7.6%. The commodity 
dependent Australian market was 
particularly weak being down 15.2%.
Underlying revenue in T orque T ransmission 
fell 5.9% as a major mass transit contract 
wound down and demand in extractive 
industries softened.
The increase in adjusted operating  
profit and adjusted earnings per share 
without the benefit of sales growth 
emphasises the value accessible through 
our self-help measures. We remain focused 
on creating a continuous improvement 
culture in all of our locations and activities 
to deliver intelligent and sustainable 
reductions in our cost base. As these 
initiatives take root towards the end of the 
new financial year, we expect to turn our 
attention to the second phase of our 
strategic plan, the Organic Growth phase.

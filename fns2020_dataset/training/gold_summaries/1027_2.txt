 ANITE ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2012
OVERVIEW
04
INTRODUCTION
I am pleased to report that Anite had an 
exceptional year in terms of its ﬁnancial 
results, which comfortably exceeded the 
Board’s expectations. While the highlight of 
the year was Handset Testing’s particularly 
strong performance, driven mainly by 
a signiﬁcant increase in revenue for LTE 4G 
products, each of our three businesses, 
Handset Testing, Network Testing and Travel, 
made signiﬁcant operational progress. 
STRATEGY AND PROGRESS
We continue to make good progress with our 
strategy to position Anite as a global leader 
in wireless test software, and to take 
advantage of the opportunities that will 
emerge from the development and roll-out 
of LTE 4G technology. 
The Board believes that our Wireless division 
operates in a long-term growth market, 
which has high barriers to entry and relatively 
few major competitors. This enables it to 
generate good proﬁt margins and returns 
on investments. Wireless contributed an 
increased proportion of total Anite revenue 
– 84% (2011: 79%). 
Our strategy for Travel is to increase its 
long-term value as it changes its business 
model. Its @com product is the only proven 
large-scale reservation system on the market 
today and is at the beginning of a potential 
20-year product life cycle. It sits at the very 
heart of our customers’ businesses and offers 
them greater efﬁciency and reduced costs. 
The addition in recent years, of TUI Central 
Europe and UK, and Thomas Cook UK to 
Travel’s expanding customer base represented 
signiﬁcant landmarks in strengthening and 
improving its market position and in building 
long-term revenue visibility. 
In both divisions, Wireless and Travel, the 
Board anticipates that the majority of growth 
will be organic: it will come from underlying 
growth in their respective markets, 
investment in their products to win market 
share, and lengthy and cumulative product 
life cycles. In addition, the Board is 
committed to maintaining market leadership 
by continuing to invest in R&D.
Finally, it is the Board’s intention that we 
should maintain a strong ﬁnancial position, 
to provide ﬁnancial ﬂexibility through 
a combination of retaining a net cash  
position while having access to appropriate 
bank facilities through a new ﬁve-year 
£20m revolving credit facility signed in 
October 2011.
RESULTS SUMMARY 
The Group’s results were well ahead of the 
previous year and both divisions reported 
strong underlying proﬁtability: our Wireless 
division, as a whole, reported an adjusted 
operating margin of 26% (2011: 22%) while 
our Travel division reported 23% (2011: 21%). 
Overall Group adjusted operating proﬁt was 
up 64%, to £28.8m (2011: £17.6m), on 
revenue up 31%, to £122.5m (2011: £93.7m). 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share were  
up 76%, to 6.7p (2011: 3.8p). 
Robust cash generation enabled us to 
maintain a strong ﬁnancial position at the  
year end. Net cash, as at 30 April 2012, was 
£16.9m (April 2011: £27.7m). The reported 
Anite reported strong results and made good progress  
in all three businesses in the year.

OVERVIEW
We remain committed to ensuring we 
continue to improve our governance and 
processes and details on this are set out in 
the Corporate governance report on pages  
40 to 45, the Audit Committee report 
on pages 56 and 57 and the Remuneration 
Committee report on pages 46 to 55.
SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK 
Anite reported strong results and made good 
progress in all three businesses in the year. 
In particular, the LTE 4G opportunity has 
added an additional layer to our expertise: 
we are now a leading force in two signiﬁcant 
handset testing sub-markets – 2G/3G and 
LTE 4G. As a result, Handset Testing is in a 
better position to take advantage of larger 
markets than in the past and is capable of 
achieving double-digit revenue growth for 
the immediate future.
Based on the opportunities available to 
each of our businesses, Anite is well placed  
to deliver sustainable organic growth and 
increased shareholder value.

DIVIDEND
In recognition of the signiﬁcant growth in 
earnings per share over the past two years, 
the Board is recommending a signiﬁcantly 
increased ﬁnal dividend of 1.125p per share, 
an increase of 53% on the previous year 
(2011: 0.735p per share). This will result  
in a total dividend for the year of 1.50p per 
share, a 43% increase on the previous year’s 
total dividend (2011: 1.05p per share). It is 
proposed that the ﬁnal dividend be paid on 
23 October 2012 to shareholders on the 
register at 28 September 2012.
Overall, the Board’s intention is to maintain 
a progressive dividend policy, broadly in line 
with earnings growth, and to retain strong 
dividend cover. 
PEOPLE
On behalf of the Board, I recognise that 
Anite’s success in recent years has been  
built on the deep industry expertise of our 
committed and hard-working staff. It is their 
know-how and experience that keeps us at 
the forefront of our industries. 
GOVERNANCE 
The Board recognises the importance that 
good corporate governance and the highest 
standards of professional ethics have in 
achieving its goal of delivering shareholder 
value. I am satisﬁed by the breadth and 
range of skills of the individual Directors and 
am pleased that the Board performance 
evaluation we undertook this year conﬁrmed 
that the Board operates effectively.

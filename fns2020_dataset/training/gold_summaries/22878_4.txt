casing for every sausage
Devro at a glance
Our mission Our business model
Extracting collagen
Collagen used for casing and gel  
is taken from the hides of carefully 
selected animals – officially approved 
for human consumption.
Operating safely,  
to provide the world’s 
food manufacturers 
with a safe and secure 
supply of consistently 
better collagen 
products, helping 
them optimise 
efficiency and 
enhancing the value 
of their offering.
Why our business exists
Devro’s collagen casing is used to 
manufacture all varieties of sausage. 
Historically, animal intestines were  
used as casing for sausage, but over  
the past 50 years the use of collagen 
casing has significantly increased,  
as it enables food manufacturers to 
automate production and reduce costs. 
It is better suited to contemporary food 
hygiene and traceability requirements, 
and technical specifications can be 
determined in advance. 
What our customers do
Devro’s customers manufacture 
branded and own-label sausage 
products worldwide, reaching 
consumers through retail and  
food service outlets.
Manufacture
Devro is a world leader in the 
manufacturing technology of this 
highly sophisticated process. Our 
casings are consistent, reliable and 
versatile to suit the needs of both 
sausage manufacturers and  
consumer preferences.
Applied technology
The production of collagen casing is a 
complex technological process. Devro 
combines expertise and innovation  
to produce casings that allow our 
customers to make better sausage.
How we do this
How we create value
Devro creates value by converting  
a basic raw material, collagen, from 
the inner layer of cattle and sow 
hides, into a homogeneous gel and 
extruding it to tightly controlled 
dimensions, before being compressed 
and packed for supply to customers. 
Devro’s manufacturing processes are 
unique and have evolved over many 
years of technical development. 
Who we sell to
Devro’s revenue comes primarily from 
the sale of collagen products directly 
to food manufacturers and, in some 
markets, local distributors. Devro sells 
to over 1,000 customers in more than 
100 countries, with a product range  
in excess of 500 individual items, 
covering eight principal types  
of application.  3

customer-facing operations as sales

support to customers.
Why our customers choose Devro
To satisfy our customers’ demands, 
we use our knowledge of how to 
manipulate the complex chemistry of 
collagen to balance the requirements 
of food producers for strength  
and size stability with consumer 
preferences for tenderness and bite.

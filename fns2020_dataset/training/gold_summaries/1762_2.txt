 Outlook
A feature of our business is the good visibility provided by our strong order book.
A further year of good growth is anticipated in 2009,despite a lower level of land vehicle sales
than in 2008.
In addition,the Group’s trading results would be expected to benefit from a continued weakness
of sterling against the US dollar.

I am pleased to report a strong set of results for 
2014. Group revenue rose by 11% to £1,599.7m 
(2013: £1,438.2m). While this increase benefited 
from acquisitions made in the second half of 2013, 
this benefit was broadly offset by the adverse 
impact of the strengthening of sterling on the 
translation of the Group’s overseas revenues. 
Despite an adverse currency impact of £9.3m 
operating profit increased to £92.0m, was 18%  
up on the £77.8m in the previous year and profit 
before tax increased to £85.1m (2013: £74.1m). 
Earnings per share were 75.3p (2013: 73.0p).
We delivered another increase in the Group 
operating margin from 5.4% in 2013 to 5.8%, 
marking further progress in raising the margin 
towards our through-the-cycle target of 6.5%. 
The margin uplift reflects improving conditions  
in some of our markets, most notably the US, a 
continuing drive for improvements in all aspects 
of the business and a good performance on 
several major projects.
Cash generated from operations was £165.4m, 
representing 117% of EBITDA (2013: 106%). 2014 
was the third year in a row that cash generated 
from operations has exceeded EBITDA, reflecting 
the Group’s relentless focus on improving 
working capital ratios across the business and 
ensuring profits turn into cash. 
Year-end net debt was £102.2m (2013: £143.7m), 
representing 0.7x EBITDA. Net capital expenditure 
was £61.0m, up on last year’s £42.6m and amounting 
to 1.2x depreciation. This return to a more normal 
level of capital expenditure reflects higher 
revenues generally and the Group’s ongoing 
investment in higher growth markets.
During 2014, the Group refinanced its  
syndicated revolving credit facilities and raised  
new debt in the US private placement market.  
A £250m revolving credit facility expiring in 
September 2019 was agreed in July, replacing  
both the £170m facility expiring in April 2015  
and the US$150m facility expiring in July 2017.  
In the fourth quarter, the Group raised US$125m 
of new US private placement funds repayable  
in 2021 and 2024, US$70m of which was used  
to repay maturing borrowings.
The financial position of the Group remains  
very strong. There is comfortable headroom  
in the Group’s main financing facilities and we 
continue to operate well within all of our  
financial covenants.
Exceptional items
The 2014 result includes an exceptional charge 
relating to the settlement of a dispute on a 
completed contract of £54.0m and a number  
of much smaller non-trading exceptional items 
relating to acquisitions, which are required to  
be expensed under IFRS. 
The contract dispute relates to a project that the 
Group’s UK subsidiary, Keller Limited, completed 
in 2008. The dispute was subject to litigation 
proceedings involving a number of parties, but 
these were settled in February 2015. The final 
cost to Keller is subject to a number of remedial 
and other actions to be undertaken as part of the 
settlement agreement. The exceptional charge 
represents management’s best estimate of the 
net cost to Keller before taking account of future 
recoveries under applicable insurances, as these 
cannot be recognised under IFRS. 
After taking account of these exceptional items, 
the Group’s post-tax result for the year was a loss 
of £1.2m (2013: profit of £30.1m).

4 Keller Group plc | Annual Report & Accounts 2014 Dividends
As a result of these improved underlying results, 
the Board’s confidence in the business going 
forward and its commitment to a progressive 
dividend policy, the Board has decided to 
recommend a final dividend of 16.8p per share 
(2013: 16.0p per share), to be paid on 8 June 2015 
to shareholders on the register at 13 March 2015. 
Together with the interim dividend paid of 8.4p, 
this brings the total dividend per share for the 
year to 25.2p (2013: 24.0p), an increase of 5%. 
Dividend cover, before exceptional items, for  
the full year was 3.0x (2013: 3.0x). 
Strategy
The Group’s strategy remains to extend further 
our global leadership in specialist ground 
engineering through both organic growth and 
targeted acquisitions. We aim to deliver this 
through expanding in higher growth markets, 
developing and transferring technologies, offering 
design/build and alternative solutions and through 
a programme of business improvement initiatives.
Board 
In June 2014, we announced the appointment  
of Nancy Tuor Moore as an independent 
Non-executive Director to the Board and 
Chairman of our Health, Safety and Environment 
Committee. Nancy’s extensive international 
business experience, together with her proven 
record in winning and safely delivering both global 
and local contracts, will enable her to make a 
significant contribution to the Keller Board. 
In September 2014, Justin Atkinson announced  
his intention to retire as the Company’s CEO by 
the end of 2015 and we have commenced a search 
process to identify his successor. That search is in 
progress and we will notify shareholders as soon 
as we reach a conclusion. Meanwhile, Justin 
continues to deliver the Group’s strategy with  
the full support of the Board and his Executive 
management team.
Employees
Over 9,000 employees have contributed to the 
strong performance of the Group during 2014. 
On behalf of the Directors, I would like to thank 
them for their hard work and efforts. As a  
Board, we will continue to provide leadership  
and oversight in respect of the Keller culture, 
creating an environment in which our  
employees can thrive.
Outlook
After a relatively quiet period in the summer of 
2014, the Group’s contract awards have picked up 
in recent months. As a result, the order book at 
the end of January is 8% higher than at the same 
time last year. This increase is spread across all the 
Group’s divisions except Australia, where the 
Wheatstone contract, the largest in Keller’s 
history, is now largely complete.
The 2014 results demonstrate the continued 
strength of the Group’s business model. Our 
breadth of geographies and capabilities puts us in 
a good position to pursue future growth which, 
coupled with strong risk management and 
ongoing self-help measures, positions us well  
for the future.
Whilst conditions in our main markets remain 
mixed, the gradual upturn in the US, our largest 
market, continuing improvements in our 
operating performance and our strong order 
book mean that the Group is set for another  
year of good progress in 2015.

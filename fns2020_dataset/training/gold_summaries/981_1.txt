unlocking the Company’s intrinsic value. 
Our 1,962 sq km portfolio of prospective 
gold/copper/silver assets in Azerbaijan 
includes our flagship Gedabek mine, which 
produced 50,215 ounces of gold in FY 2012, 
our Gosha Contract Area, which is located 
50 km away from Gedabek, and Ordubad, 
which is located in the Nakchivan Republic 
region of Azerbaijan. 
Mining operations
Gedabek
Gedabek is currently an open pit heap leach 
gold-copper-silver mining operation located 
in a 300 sq km Contract Area in western 
Azerbaijan on the Tethyan Tectonic Belt, 
one of the world’s significant copper and 
gold bearing regions. 
For the 12 month period to 31 December 2012, 
gold production from Gedabek’s heap leach 
operation totalled 50,215 ounces (in gold 
doré) with an average cash operating cost 
of US$668 per ounce. In terms of gold 
sales, 42,557 ounces of gold were sold 
at an average of US$1,666 per ounce in 
FY 2012. It should be noted that 6,246 ounces 
of gold were transferred to the Government 
of Azerbaijan as part of the Company’s 
Product Sharing Agreement in FY 2012.
Table 1 below is a summary table of gold 
production and prices which outlines 
quarter-on-quarter gold production at 
Gedabek for FY 2012. 
With regards to silver production from the 
plant’s heap leach operations, production 
totalled 20,133 ounces with 16,342 ounces 
of silver sold at an average price of US$32.
In terms of processing, Gedabek’s heap 
leach stacking operation has performed 
in line with management’s expectations 
in FY 2012 with 753,601 tonnes of dry ore 
having been transferred to the leach pads 
with an average gold content of 3.03 g/t 
(2011: 842,751 tonnes of dry ore with an 
average gold content of 4.33 g/t). The 
reduced grade for the period was in line 
with our mining plan. Table 2 summaries 
the levels of dry ore that have been 
transferred to the leach pads at Gedabek 
on a quarterly basis from 1 January 2012 
to 31 December 2012.

Overview
Corporate governance
Financial statements Mining operations continued
Gedabek continued
Gedabek is currently an open pit mining 
operation, which utilises a conventional 
heap leach process and a resin adsorption 
recovery plant. Heap leach operations are 
traditionally a low-cost processing route 
that many mining operations, including 
Gedabek, adopt when they first move 
into production due to the low-capital 
construction costs. Whilst our heap leach 
operation has seen steady gold production 
at Gedabek from the first gold pour in 
May 2009 (to end of FY 2012 185,912 ounces 
have been produced), heap leaching has 
limitations with regards to the size of ore 
being leached (-25 mm). This limitation 
results in gold recoveries of circa 70%, with 
leaching cycles extending typically up to 
a year, depending on the ore mineralogy. 
With the above in mind, we conducted a 
review to best ascertain how to improve 
the gold production profile of Gedabek. 
In May 2012, following a Pre-Feasibility 
Study carried out by mining consultants, 
Arcadis Chile Limited, we announced our 
intention to construct an agitation leaching 
plant at Gedabek. In comparison to heap 
leaching, agitation leaching of milled ore 
can deliver higher recoveries, with the 
immediate production of gold. The new 
agitation leaching plant will process high 
grade oxide ore and additional sulphidic 
ore resources that are not suitable for 
Gedabek’s current heap leaching operation; 
together with spent ore from the leach heaps 
to further improve total gold recoveries. 
Agitation leaching recovery rates have 
been initially estimated at 85% for oxide 
material and 69% for sulphide material, 
although we are carrying out additional 
testing to see if these recovery rates can 
be further improved. The plant, which 
will have a capacity to treat 100 tonnes 
per hour of ore, is anticipated to be 
commissioned in H1 2013 and had an 
estimated capital cost of US$52 million, 
including construction of the tailings 
dam and all related infrastructure. It is 
believed that the cost of construction of 
the agitation leaching plant is circa 
US$7 million under budget.
In addition to gold and silver, our 
Gedabek operation also produces a 
copper concentrate from a Sulphidisation, 
Acidification, Recycling and Thickening 
(‘SART’) process, which recovers copper in 
the form of a precipitated copper sulphide 
concentrate containing silver and minor 
amounts of gold. The recovery of copper 
and silver through SART is in the region 
of 90% and 96%, respectively, and the 
process also has the economic benefit 
of recovering cyanide from the leach 
solutions. In terms of copper concentrate 
production, for FY 2012 we produced 
502 tonnes of copper, 98,158 ounces of 
silver and 86 ounces of gold (2010: 611 tonnes 
of copper, 134,240 ounces of silver and 
200 ounces of gold).
See table 3 overleaf for a full quarterly 
breakdown of copper concentrate 
production through SART. 
During FY 2012 total sales of copper 
concentrate were US$2.1 million. We also 
signed a sales contract in Q4 2012 with 
Glencore International plc (‘Glencore’) 
for the sale of 2,500 wet metric tonnes 
(‘WMT’) and 550 dry metric tonnes of 
copper concentrate. Under the terms of 
the agreement, which is already underway, 
Glencore is committed to purchase 250 WMT 
per month of copper concentrate product 
with an option to stop buying at 1,500 WMT. 
Anglo Asian is now intending to arrange 
further sales contracts for its copper 
concentrate stockpiles, which totalled 
2,900 WMT at 31 December 2012. 
Gedabek Exploration 
Increasing Gedabek’s production profile and 
life of mine through defined exploration 
programmes continued to be a priority for 
the Company during 2012. At the beginning 
of the year Gedabek’s resource stood at 
791,000 ounces of gold, 49,300 tonnes 
of copper and 7,597,000 ounces of silver 
for all categories. After completing 
14,510 metres of drilling (2010–2011 
two-phased drilling programme) in 
April 2012, we were delighted to announce 
a JORC resource upgrade of 48,138,979 
tonnes at 0.825 g/t gold for 1,276,422 ounces 
of gold in the Measured, Indicated and 
Inferred categories (a 61% increase from 
the previous JORC resource estimate 
dated October 2010); 0.197% copper for 
94,890 tonnes (a 93% increase); and 6.66 g/t 
silver for 10,305,653 ounces (a 36% increase) 
at a cut-off grade of 0.3 g/t gold. The 
new resource statement also took into 
consideration the information of the 
2006 exploration drilling campaign, which 
consisted of an additional 20,426 metres 
of drilling at Gedabek. 
Using these new resource figures, we 
instructed our mining consultants, CAE 
Mining International Ltd, to update the ore 
reserves estimation of the Gedabek Mineral 
Deposit. In June 2012, we announced a 
maiden JORC compliant ore reserve report, 
which showed a total mineable reserve 
of 20,312,879 tonnes at 1.139 g/t gold 
for 744,038 ounces, 0.293% copper for 
59,479 tonnes and 9.456 g/t silver for 
6,175,531 ounces as at 30 December 2011, 
of which 532,607 ounces of gold are 
recoverable, a significant increase over the 
previous internal estimate of 311,000 ounces 
announced in 2007, prior to the start of 
construction of the Gedabek mine.
The ultimate optimal open pit ore reserve 
was estimated by applying the Lerchs-
Grossman open pit optimisation algorithm 
and taking into consideration an extensive 
sensitivity analysis of several technical 
and economic scenarios. 
The updated ore reserves estimation was 
based on a cut-off grade of 0.3 g/t of gold

Chief Executive’s review continued
08 Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2012 and considered the following mineral 
processing options for the extraction of gold, 
copper and silver from the mineral resource: 
heap leaching for oxide mineralisation 
at 0.3 ≤ Au g/t < 1.0; agitation leaching for 
oxide mineralisation at 1.0 ≤ Au g/t < ∞ and 
sulphide mineralisation at 1.0 ≤ Au g/t < ∞; 
and flotation for sulphide mineralisation at 
0.3 ≤ Au g/t < 1.0. In addition, the updated ore 
reserves were constrained with the open pit 
surface topography as on 30 December 2011. 
The updated Proved and Probable ore 
reserves estimations are described in 
table 4 below. 
The ore will be recovered through a 
combination of the existing heap leaching 
operation at Gedabek, the new agitation 
leaching plant and a flotation plant which 
we plan to construct later in the life of 
the mine. 
It must also be noted that the total ore 
reserve statement accounts for ore in 
the ground at 30 December 2011 and does 
not account for ore that has already been 
mined and which is currently stacked on 
the leach pads. The ore on the leach pads 
still contains circa 90,000 ounces of gold, 
which the Company will either recover 
through the on-going heap leaching process, 
or by reprocessing the spent ore in the heaps 
through the agitation leaching plant.
An additional 28,872 metre drilling 
programme has also been completed in 
2012 which has targeted an extension of the 
existing mine at Gedabek with the aim of 
further increasing the mineral reserves and 
resources in 2013, as part of our on-going 
exploration and development programme. 
Recent drilling indicates significant 
potential to continue increasing the size of 
the Gedabek resource and we look forward 
to updating the market on these results in 
due course.
Gosha
The 300 sq km Gosha Contract Area 
is located in western Azerbaijan, 50 km 
north-west of Gedabek, and contains 
three prospects: Gosha, Itkirlan and 
Munduglu. Following the Government of 
Azerbaijan’s approval of the Development 
and Production Programme in May 2012, 
it is our intention to develop a small, high 
grade, underground gold mine at Gosha 
producing gold at an average rate of 15,000 
to 20,000 ounces per annum for a period 
of at least five years.
A development work programme and 
budget was submitted to the Government 
of Azerbaijan on 4 December 2012 aiming 
to commence development work at Gosha 
in H2 2013 with a view to moving to 
production by 2014, whilst at the same time 
implementing further drilling campaigns 
in order to increase the economics 
of the proposed mine at Gosha. Mining 
equipment has been ordered and service 
and infrastructure building work is to 
commence in H2 2013, including access 
roads, workshop, offices, a laboratory 
and building upgrade work. The mine 
production programme starting in H2 2013 
will develop 1,975 metres of production 
and haulage galleries to produce 30,000 
tonnes of ore, with an average grade of 
15.6 g/t of gold and 38.6 g/t of silver, 
together with 35,500 tonnes of waste. 
Studies have been conducted to determine 
different mining plan alternatives and these 
have shown that high grade ore can be 
produced from the mine and transported 
and treated in the agitation leach plant 
at Gedabek until 2015. It is envisaged that 
from 2016 onwards, the ore from Gosha 
mine may be processed in a flotation plant 
at Gosha.
Ordubad
Our 462 sq km Ordubad Contract Area 
is located in the Nakhchivan region of 
Azerbaijan and contains numerous targets 
including Shakardara, Piyazbashi, Misdag, 
Agyurt, Shalala and Diakchay, which are all 
located within a 5 km radius of each other.
We were pleased to report a Notice of 
Discovery for gold at Ordubad in April 2012. 
The Notice of Discovery is a requirement 
set out in the Company’s Production Share 
Agreement (‘PSA’), which needs to be in 
place before the technical and economical 
evaluation of a deposit in terms of a 
Development and Production Programme 
can take place. We plan to release further 
information concerning the results of the 
studies and exploration work in due course 
and further exploration work is now planned 
with a view to confirming a small gold 
deposit with production potential.

Overview
Corporate governance
Financial statements Outlook
2012 has been a highly active year for 
Anglo Asian with gold production of 
50,215 ounces and sales of 42,557 ounces, 
copper production 502 tonnes and copper 
concentrate sales of US$2.1 million and 
significant profitability of US$28.6 million 
for the year. Gold production at the beginning 
of 2013 remains on target and with the 
agitation leaching plant near completion 
and due to be commissioned in H1 2013 
(on time and US$7 million under budget), 
gold production for FY 2013 is targeted for 
60,000 ounces, a 20% increase from FY 2012. 
Not only will the agitation leaching plant help 
to improve gold recoveries and production, 
it will also lead to decreased cash operating 
costs of around US$450–500, which would 
place Anglo Asian in the lower quartile 
of gold mining companies in terms 
of operating costs. In the meantime, 
exploration at Gedabek has been on-going 
and significant progress in terms of extending 
the life of mine at Gedabek by increasing 
the resource and reserve base has been 
made. We also remain highly active at our 
Gosha gold project, which provides us with 
further exploration upside and, importantly, 
production potential for the future. With 
mining development at Gosha due to begin 
in H2 2013 and production targeted for 
2014, we envisage we should become an 
80,000–90,000 ounces per annum gold 
producer by the end of 2014. With the 
above in mind we look forward to the 
coming year at this exciting time in the 
Company’s development as a mid-tier 
gold, copper and silver mining company.

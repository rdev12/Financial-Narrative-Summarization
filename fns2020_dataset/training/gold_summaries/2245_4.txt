The Adult division publishes globally in English for readers of fiction, biography, sport, food 
and drink, general reference and special interests such as yachting and ornithology. The main 
publishing operations are based in New York and London and coordinated by experienced

Reed’s Nautical , Wisden Cricketers’ and Whitaker’s Almanacks as well as the great institution 
which is Who’s Who.
Our objectives are to be the publisher of choice for the very best authors and the very best 
books in both digital and print formats. We pay particular attention to editorial support 
for authors both during the publication process and thereafter; the highest standards of

Children’s Books trade lists in both UK and US; the Walker Books for Young Readers imprint

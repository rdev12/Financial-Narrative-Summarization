 HIGHLIGHTS
DROUJBA
Project JORC compliant resource 
increased from 2.5 to 3million carats 
(+20%)
Droujba pipe resource of 2.5million 
carats at a diamond value of $45 per 
carat
Katcha dyke resource of 446,000 
carats at a diamond value of $57 per 
carat.
Katcha resource delineated only over 
470m of 5,000m strike length to 
150m depth, has potential for multi-
million carat resource
Conceptual economic scoping study 
of Droujba pipe shows potential 
for short three year life of mine, 
producing 313,000 carats and $15m 
revenue at current diamond prices
Project placed on temporary care 
and maintenance whilst focus 
remains on Tongo and will be re-
assessed in 2014 if rough diamond 
prices continue to improve

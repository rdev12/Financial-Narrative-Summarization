the evolution group plc
Report & Accounts 2003
2003 was a year of strong growth
in all of our operating businesses.
Additionally, the Group realised
significant value from the listing
of its former subsidiary, IP2IPO
Group Plc (formerly IP2IPO Group
Limited (“IP2IPO”)). Overall, I am
pleased to report a profit before
tax of £17.9 million (2002: loss
£23.8 million). Total shareholder
return rose 88% during 2003, 48%
ahead of the FTSE Smallcap Index.
Results
Evolution Beeson Gregory Limited
(“EVBG”) had a very good first full
year as a combined business and
our investment banking platform
developed significantly during 2003.
We continued to gain market share
in the small and mid cap sectors in
sales and trading and our
significantly enhanced market
making business performed well
and ahead of our expectations.
Corporate broking remained a
cornerstone of our business with
significant transactions completed
and funds raised for our clients.
Operating income has grown by
264% to £32.1m in 2003 with all
divisions showing extremely strong
growth. Finally, our research
coverage continues to increase in
depth and quality as evidenced by
our improved ratings in key market
surveys such as Extel and
Institutional Investor. Christows Limited (“Christows”), the
Group’s private client stockbroking
and fund management business,
had a second profitable year after
its restructuring in 2001. It
continues to increase its funds
under management, reaching
£477m as at 31 December 2003
(2002: £327m), an increase of 46%.
Strategic funds under management,
on which we receive recurring fees,
now represent 83% of this total
(2002: 77%). This business is
developing to plan and has
increased its geographical coverage
with the opening of a new office in
Bath, strengthening its presence in
the South and South West of
England. 
IP2IPO has made a significant
transformation during 2003.
Following the successful listing on
AIM on 15 October 2003, IP2IPO is
now a separate and independently
functioning operation. The Group
has reduced its holding in this
company to 40.61% following the
sale of 5,460,000 shares upon the
flotation. This process realised
£15m of cash.
Board changes
The Board is delighted to have
announced the appointment of
Nicholas Irens as a Non-executive
director on 1 January 2004. Nick
has a wealth of experience, from
both executive and non-executive
roles, and is a valuable addition to
the Board. 
At the time of the announcement
of IP2IPO’s preliminary results on 18
March 2004, David Norwood, the
Chief Executive of IP2IPO, informed
the Board of his decision to step
down as a Non-executive director of
the Company. I would like to take
this opportunity on behalf of the
Board, employees and shareholders
to thank David for his enormous
contribution both in the creation
and the successful building of the
Group.
Employees
The results of our operating
businesses are determined largely by
the efforts and commitment of our
staff who are one of the principal
assets of the Group. I would like to
thank everyone for their efforts last
year which contributed to a
successful 2003. As highlighted at
the interim stage and in the
subsequent shareholder notice, the
Group implemented an all employee
share incentive plan which has now
been successfully launched, through
which the majority of employees
have taken the opportunity to
purchase Evolution shares every
month, which are then matched by
the Company where individuals
remain in the Group for three years.
Additionally, throughout the Group,
there are other option and share
schemes which we use to provide
equity participation to incentivise
and motivate our key employees.  
Dividend
The Board recommends the
payment of a dividend of 0.25p per
share (2002: Nil). This represents an
acknowledgement of our growth in
confidence in the income growth
and profitability of the Group. It is
anticipated that a progressive
dividend policy will be pursued as
the Group achieves its objectives in
2004.
Outlook
As the first quarter of 2004
comes towards a conclusion, I am
pleased to announce that our
businesses are all continuing to
progress well and your Board is
confident of further success in
2004.

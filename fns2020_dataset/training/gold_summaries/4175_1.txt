 Over the year under review, 
organic performance at the
operating agency level was very
strong with an increase of 15 per
cent. in PBIT on a like for like basis.
This performance has to be reviewed
against the less than 5 per cent.
growth reported for most marketing
service sectors. 
CML, one of Britain’s leading
qualitative research companies was
acquired on 3 September 2004 and
its acquisition further extends our
research capabilities. DLKW, one 
of Britain’s leading advertising and
integrated agency groups, was
acquired on 9 March 2005, and
marked an excellent finish to the
year. Its acquisition was funded 
by a Placing and Open Offer of
shares which raised £9.8 million 
for the Group. 
Creston now has a broad range 
of marketing service businesses 
with a strong balance sheet and
cash flows. 
Insight Division
Creston’s Insight Division had a
strong year delivering a 25 per cent.
increase in PBIT (the British Market
Research Association’s reported 4
per cent. growth in turnover for
2004). This was underpinned by
strong higher margin UK work
compared to international work and
effective cost control. 
Over two thirds of MSL’s business is
generated by repeat business from
its clients such as Tesco, Unilever
and Kimberly Clark. Key new clients
won in the year for MSL include
Drambuie, Boots Healthcare
International and Lafarge. 
MSTS, the sensory research
subsidiary of MSL, had a succession
of new business wins such as
Premier Foods, General Mills and
RHM, plus a growing relationship
with Heinz. 
CML was only acquired in
September 2004 but already
include the new win of Toyota
Europe and being added to the COI
Communications roster. CML’s other
clients include Vodafone, Halifax
and Audi.

Marketing 
Communications Division
Creston’s Marketing
Communications division grew 
by 18 per cent. PBIT over the
2004 year. The marketing
communications sector is not
reported on as a single unit, but we
have used the Keynote 2005 report
on Direct Marketing as a guide.
This shows an estimated growth of
5 per cent. in turnover for the
industry in 2004 on 2003. 
TRA had strong organic growth
from clients such as Pfizer and
Cow & Gate and excellent new
business wins. PepsiCo’s Tropicana
was an important win for TRA and
has been further strengthened by
the win of a further Tropicana
brand, PJ Smoothies; together with
HPI, the vehicle tracking subsidiary
of Norwich Union. 
EMO enjoyed increased
expenditure by BMW, George
Wimpey, Bang & Olufsen 
and Honda. 
Whilst only being part of Creston
since 9 March 2005, Dialogue 
and TCR had demonstrated strong
performance, most noticeably for
Dialogue with the integrated win for
the AA, breakdown and roadside
assistance. 
Public Relations Division
Creston acquired NBC in October
2003 and therefore a full year like
for like is not possible, however, on
an annualised basis, the company
has achieved substantial growth.
Canon, Toshiba and NTL remain
important clients. New wins in this
year include Bollinger, The Post
Office Residential Phone Services,
Vonage, the US market leader for
telephony services over broadband
and Warner Home Video.
Advertising Division 
DLKW was acquired on 9 March
2005 and therefore there are only
three weeks figures consolidated
into the Group. 
As well as major clients like HBOS,
Vauxhall, COI Communications,
e-Bay, W H Smith, new wins this
calendar year include the AA,
Diageo’s Bulliet Bourbon, General
Motors Vectra across Europe and
SCA’s Tena brand across Europe. 
The advertising industry showed
real growth in 2004 with an
estimated increase of 5 per cent.
in revenue over 2003 according 
to the Advertising Association and
growth for 2005 is predicted at 4.5
per cent.
Synergy
It has been a successful year for
incremental synergy income and the
synergy opportunities are increasing
as the Group grows.
Examples include Tropicana
research projects, the PR launch 
of the BMW Series 1 and London
Dungeons have appointed Nelson
Bostock on a retained basis for PR. 
In total, thirteen clients now work
with more than one agency within
the Group, including: Campbells,
Tropicana, Premier Foods, Nutricia,
London Dungeons, Bacardi, Arla
Foods, Scottish Courage, COI
Communications, Danone, Pfizer,
Unilever, BMW.
We are committed to increasing
these synergy opportunities, as 
they represent a key area of future
organic growth. To this end, we 
are near to employing a Synergy
New Business Director to 
leverage further the cross selling
opportunities across the Group. 
Forward Plans 
We have built a strong domestic
diversified marketing services group
in four years and aim to continue to
add in the UK with complementary
business in healthcare, digital and
other growth niche marketing
service areas. 
International 
It is our stated intention to become
an international marketing group in
order to better serve clients. We
hope to make progress in this goal
during the new financial year,
particularly in the US, which offers
a large and relatively buoyant
economy and further growth
opportunities for the Group. 
Outlook
I am pleased to report that the
current financial year has started
well with performance ahead of 
the Board’s expectations. Business
prospects are strong reflecting the
aforementioned recent client wins,
such as the AA, Diageo, SCA,
General Motors Vectra, Tropicana
brands and this new business
record should help continue the
Group’s impressive organic growth 
into 2006.

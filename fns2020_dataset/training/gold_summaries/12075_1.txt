Operational expenditures remain robust,  
though increased tendering activity
Approximately 25% of our revenue in 2009 was 
generated by our businesses which rely upon our 
customers’ operational expenditures, namely,  
Offshore Engineering & Operations, Training Services 
and Production Solutions, where activities are largely 
focused in the UKCS and the UAE. As expected, 
operating expenditures largely remained robust during 
2009, as our customers continued to operate and 
maintain their facilities. We did, however, see many  
of our customers defer discretionary expenditure, 
particularly in our consultancy businesses and in  
some areas of Training Services, though we are seeing 
an increase in opportunities for these businesses and 
expect them to return to growth during 2010.
Over the long term, we expect to see many 
opportunities for Training Services, as the industry  
will require to recruit and train many new engineers  
to replace those set to retire in the next few years. We 
are looking at building upon our strategic relationships 
with key NOC and IOC customers to assist them with  
this challenge. 
During 2009, we have seen an increased focus on cost 
control from our customers and, as expected, many 
customers have or are considering tendering contracts 
rather than renewing or extending them. While this 
represents both a threat to existing service contracts 
and an opportunity to secure new business, we have 
been a net beneficiary of this activity, securing two 
significant contracts in our Offshore Engineering & 
Operations business where we were not the incumbent 
(see page 44 for details).
We expect to see more tendering activity throughout 
2010, and see this as an opportunity to grow further 
our operations businesses that are dependent upon 
operational expenditures.

Outlook 2009. The reference scenario describes ‘what would 
happen if, among other things, governments were to take no 
new initiatives bearing on the energy sector, beyond those 
already adopted by mid-2009’.
 3 The IEA (World Energy Outlook 2009) estimates that less than 
one-third of global gas production in 2030 will be met by 
existing production. Goldman Sachs (‘280 Projects to Change 
the World’, 15 January 2010) forecasts that decline rates are 
such that OPEC will be at full utilisation from 2011/12 and 
non-OPEC supply has been in decline since 2004.

Long-term demand expected to remain strong
Despite the global economic downturn, there has been 
little change in expectations for long-term growth in 
global demand for oil & gas.
While global demand for oil may have fallen by around 
1.5% in 2009 compared to 2008
1
, the International 
Energy Agency’s (IEA) reference case sees global 
demand for oil increase by approximately 24% from 
current levels of around 85 million barrels per day (bpd) 
to around 105 million bpd by 2030
2
, driven primarily by 
an increase in demand from China, India and the 
Middle East. Global demand for gas is expected to 
increase by approximately 43%
1
 from around 48 million 
bpd of oil equivalent to 69 million bpd of oil equivalent 
over the same period, with an increase in demand 
expected in most regions, particularly in the Middle East.
Significant investment in new-build production and 
transportation infrastructure is required to meet the 
expected growth in demand. In addition to new-build 
capacity, a large proportion of investment is required  
to replace existing production facilities
3
. Overall, the IEA 
estimates that US$11 trillion is required to be invested  
in oil & gas infrastructure by 2030. Approximately US$5 
trillion (in excess of US$200 billion per annum) of this 
expenditure is expected to be in our key Engineering  
& Construction markets of the CIS, Middle East and 
Africa. Our record order intake of US$6.3 billion in 
Engineering & Construction in 2009 represents a 
relatively small market share of a very large and 
growing market. Consequently, we expect demand  
for the group’s Engineering & Construction services  
to remain strong over the long term.
In 2009, even with an estimated 19% reduction in 
capital expenditure compared to the prior year
4
, the 
market for our services remained robust. The majority 
of project postponements and cancellations were in 
high-cost production areas, such as Canadian oil 
sands or deepwater developments (which are not focus 
areas for the group). Our core markets for Engineering 
& Construction are in areas where development and 
production costs are generally lower than average, 
such as onshore developments in the Middle East and 
Africa and many of our customers are well-financed 
NOCs, which are continuing to invest through  
the downturn.
Capital expenditure is expected to increase by around 
7% in 2010
5
 and more projects are expected to be 
sanctioned this year than in any year since 2006
6
. This 
is likely to result in an increase in conceptual studies 
and FEED studies, many of which were deferred in 
2009. We have already started to see an improved 
pipeline of bidding opportunities for our Engineering 
Services business, which is focused on such early-
cycle opportunities.

Conclusion
Despite an uncertain economic environment in the 
early part of the year, we had a very successful year  
in 2009, securing new contract awards, both in 
Engineering & Construction and Offshore Engineering 
& Operations. Our new awards resulted in the group 
increasing its backlog to US$8.1 billion (2008: US$4.0 
billion), which provides good visibility of revenues 
through to 2011 and beyond.
Notwithstanding that we still face significant 
competition, the improvement in general economic 
conditions, including the oil price returning to around 
2007 levels
1
, and indications that customers are 
increasing their capital expenditure programmes,  
gives us confidence in the medium-term outlook. 
Longer-term, the key drivers determining capital  
and operational expenditures and our geographic 
focus should ensure that our long-term prospects  
remain strong.
1 The average price for Brent in 2007 was US$72 per barrel.
Opportunities for Energy Developments
We saw more upstream opportunities in the early part 
of 2009 for Energy Developments as a number of our 
customers, particularly smaller independent oil 
companies, faced more challenging access to debt 
and equity markets and a lower oil-price environment. 
However, we remained focused on our strategy of only 
investing in development opportunities with limited 
sub-surface risk, and maintained our strict investment 
criteria in relation to assessing projects on the basis of 
returns based on conservative oil price assumptions. 
Consequently, we did not complete any new upstream 
investments during the year.
We did, however, complete our first investment in 
energy infrastructure with the acquisition of the FPF1 
floating production facility (see page 49) and we see 
further good opportunities in this market. With our 
strong balance sheet, we remain well positioned to 
invest in upstream and energy infrastructure 
opportunities and we continue to review a number  
of opportunities.
On 1 January 2009, the group reorganised its operations into seven business units, reporting under four segments:

Our principal contract awards during the year were:
Asab field development, Abu Dhabi
■
 Awarded in January 2009, the Asab field 
development is a 44-month US$2.3 billion lump-
sum EPC project with Abu Dhabi Company for 
Onshore Oil Operations (ADCO) to upgrade 
facilities at the onshore Asab oil field in Abu Dhabi.
Karan utilities and cogeneration package,  
Saudi Arabia
■
 Awarded in February 2009, the Karan utilities and 
cogeneration package is a 34-month project with 
Saudi Aramco to build utilities and cogeneration 
facilities at the Khursaniyah gas plant in Saudi 
Arabia. The capacity of the plant is being extended 
to accommodate approximately 1.8 billion cubic 
feet of high pressure sour gas from the offshore 
Karan field.
El Merk central processing facility, Algeria
■
 Awarded in March 2009, El Merk is a 44-month 
US$2.2 billion EPC project for a consortium led by 
Sonatrach and Anadarko. We will design and build 
the El Merk central processing facility in the Berkine 
Basin, which will have a design capacity of 
approximately 100,000 barrels of oil per day, 
29,000 barrels of condensate per day, 31,000 
barrels of liquid petroleum gas (LPG) per day 
together with a natural gas liquids (NGL) train with a 
nominal capacity of 600 million standard cubic feet 
of gas per day.
Kauther gas compression, Oman
■
 Awarded in late June 2009, the Kauther gas 
compression contract is a US$0.4 billion EPC 
project for a gas compression system and 
associated facilities at the Kauther gas plant. The 
contract scope also includes commissioning and 
six months of initial operations. The project follows 
on from the successful completion of the Kauther 
gas plant in 2007, which Petrofac built on an EPC 
basis for PDO Oman. In early 2008, Petrofac was 
asked to carry out the front end engineering and 
design for a gas depletion-compression project 
and then invited to submit a commercial proposal 
for the EPC on a negotiated basis.
Fourth NGL train at Integrated Gas Development,  
Abu Dhabi
■
 In July 2009, we were awarded a contract through 
our 50% owned joint venture, Petrofac Emirates, 
and in partnership with GS Engineering & 
Construction, with GASCO worth approximately 
US$2.1 billion with a value to Petrofac Emirates  
of around US$1 billion. The 48-month lump-sum 
contract with GASCO is for the construction of the 
fourth natural gas liquids (NGL) train at the Ruwais 
complex in Abu Dhabi. This is the first project to be 
awarded to Petrofac Emirates, our joint venture with 
Mubadala Petroleum Services LLC which was 
established in late 2008.
Engineering & Construction
The Engineering & Construction reporting 
segment includes the group’s Sharjah-based 
Engineering & Construction business unit and 
Engineering & Construction Ventures, which has 
been established to replicate the success of the 
Sharjah business, but in new markets, such as 
Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia. Our core markets for 
this business remain the Middle East, North Africa 
and the Commonwealth of Independent States 
(CIS), particularly the Caspian region.
Our strong partnerships, proven execution track record 
and long-established presence in the Middle East and 
North African markets has helped us achieve a record 
order intake during the year of US$6.3 billion, which 
also includes a US$100 million FEED study for 
Turkmengaz, where the contract contemplates moving 
into a second phase multi-billion dollar EPC project 
during 2010. Initial progress on our new awards has 
been in line with our expectations and we have 
delivered good operational performance across our 
broader portfolio of projects:
■
 in Syria, we have made good progress on the Ebla 
gas plant for PetroCanada with first gas exports 
expected in the next few weeks and remain on 
schedule to complete the Jihar gas plant for the 
Hayan Petroleum Company (a joint venture 
between the state-owned Syrian Petroleum 
Company and INA Industrija Nafte d.d.-Naftaplin  
of Croatia) early next year
■
 in Egypt and Tunisia, we completed and 
commissioned the Salam and Hasdrubal gas plants 
for Khalda Petroleum (a joint venture between 
Apache and the state-owned Egyptian General 
Petroleum Corporation) and BG Tunisia, 
respectively
■
 we made significant progress on the Harweel 
cluster development project for Petroleum 
Development Oman (PDO), which is scheduled for 
completion around the middle of this year
■
 we made substantial progress on the In Salah gas 
compression project in Algeria for Sonatrach, BP 
and Statoil, where the three compression stations 
are due for completion later this year
■
 in Kuwait, we completed the performance test for 
the last of the gathering centres in the facilities 
upgrade contract and all stations are now 
operational and have been handed over to Kuwait 
Oil Company and we have commenced 
construction on the Mina Alhmadi refinery 40” 
pipeline project which is due for completion later 
this year

South Yoloten gas field development, Turkmenistan
■
 We were awarded a contract in late December 
2009 by Turkmengaz, Turkmenistan’s state-run  
gas producer, to undertake a FEED study and initial 
planning and set-up studies for a 10 billion cubic 
metres per annum (bcma) gas processing facility 
along with the infrastructure and pipelines for the 
entire 20 bcma development (a second 10 bcma 
gas processing facility will be built by another 
contractor). After satisfactory conclusion of the first 
phase, worth US$100 million, the contract 
contemplates moving into a second phase which 
will include the engineering, procurement and 
commissioning work. The second phase will be  
on a lump-sum basis, with a value not to exceed 
US$4 billion.
Results
Engineering & Construction achieved strong revenue 
growth in the year due to high levels of activity, 
principally on our projects in hand at the beginning of 
the year. Revenue increased by 25.9% to US$2,509.0 
million (2008: US$1,993.5 million). The main 
contributors to revenue were: the Ebla and Jihar gas 
plants in Syria; the Harweel project in Oman; the  
In Salah gas compression project in Algeria; and  
the Asab project in Abu Dhabi.
Net profit increased by 28.5% to US$265.1 million 
(2008: US$206.3 million), representing a net margin  
of 10.6% (2008: 10.4%). The growth in net margin is 
due to continued strong operational performance, 
augmented by the recovery of prior year bid costs from 
a bidding partner, the first-time profit recognition on a 
project awarded in 2008 and a prior year adjustment in 
relation to the applicability of a lower tax rate in relation 
to our projects in Oman (see note 6 to the financial 
statements), partially offset by the dilutive effect of the 
recognition of revenue on some new contracts, where 
we are not yet recognising profit as the projects are in 
their early stages. 
Over the year, Engineering & Construction grew its 
headcount from 3,400 to 4,200. In addition, our 
engineering offices in Mumbai and Chennai are 
reported within our Engineering, Training Services  
and Production Solutions segment, but principally 
support our Engineering & Construction activities.  
At 31 December 2009, we had approximately  
1,300 employees in our Indian offices (2008: 1,000).
At 31 December, the Engineering & Construction 
backlog stood at US$6.2 billion (2008: US$2.4 billion), 
reflecting the high level of order intake during the year.

Acquisitions
In early January 2010, we completed the acquisition of 
Scotvalve Services Limited (Scotvalve), a mechanical 
services business, for an initial consideration of £3 
million. A further consideration of up to £2 million will 
be payable in cash and/or shares over three years, 
subject to achieving certain agreed performance 
targets. Scotvalve, which was founded in 1985, has 
around 40 employees located at a mechanical 
workshop in Aberdeen from which the company 
provides the servicing and repair of oilfield pressure 
control equipment. In addition, Scotvalve has the 
capability to provide its services to the oil & gas sectors 
in the Middle East and North Africa, building upon our 
existing mechanical workshop facilities in the United 
Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. 
Results
Largely as a consequence of the strength of the US 
Dollar against Sterling, reported revenue for the year 
decreased by 19.3% to US$626.7 million (2008: 
US$776.6 million) and revenue excluding ‘pass-
through’ revenue
1
 decreased by 21.4% to US$436.4 
million (2008: US$555.4 million). Approximately 90%  
of Offshore Engineering & Operations’ revenue is 
generated in the UKCS and those revenues are 
generally denominated in Sterling. The US Dollar was 
stronger against Sterling in 2009 compared to 2008 
(see the Financial Review on page 50 for a summary of 
the exchange rates), thereby having a significant impact 
on the US Dollar value of reported revenues for the 
Offshore Engineering & Operations reporting segment. 
On a constant currency basis, revenue excluding 
pass-through revenue decreased by approximately 7%.
Net profit was lower at US$12.8 million (2008: US$16.4 
million), again reflecting the strengthening of the US 
Dollar against Sterling as well as the more challenging 
trading environment. On a constant currency basis, net 
profit was approximately 5% lower. Net margin on 
revenue excluding pass-through revenue was only 
marginally lower than the prior year at 2.9% (2008: 3.0%).
Headcount was broadly unchanged at the end of 2009 
at 4,100 (2008: 4,200).
Backlog for Offshore Engineering & Operations 
increased to US$1.6 billion at 31 December 2009 
(2008: US$1.1 billion), in part due to exchange rate 
movements (on a constant currency basis at 31 
December 2008, backlog was approximately US$1.3 
billion), but principally due to new contract awards  
and extensions.
Offshore Engineering & Operations
Through Offshore Engineering & Operations we 
provide operations, maintenance and brownfield 
engineering services, predominantly in the UK 
Continental Shelf (UKCS) and principally on a 
reimbursable basis, but often with incentive 
income linked to the successful delivery of 
performance targets. Many of our operations 
contracts are long-term (typically three to five 
years) and in the case of the provision of Duty 
Holder services are generally open-ended.
We have seen an increase in tendering activity during 
the year both in the UKCS and international markets. 
Whereas in prior years contracts were often ‘rolled-
over’ with the existing supplier, under similar terms and 
conditions, customers will now often retender contracts 
on their expiry as they seek improved terms. We have 
been a beneficiary of the increase in tendering activity, 
winning two key awards:
Apache engineering and construction, UK
■
 In July 2009, we were pleased to announce the 
award of an engineering and construction contract 
with Apache for the Forties field in the North Sea. 
This represents the first time that we have secured 
a major brownfield engineering & construction 
contract where we have not been the Duty Holder 
on the facilities. The contract is expected to 
generate revenue of approximately £25 million per 
annum and run for at least three years.
BP maintenance, UK
■
 In November 2009, we secured a five-year contract 
to deliver integrated maintenance management 
support services, including the planning, co-
ordination and execution of maintenance activities, 
for all of BP’s UK offshore assets and the onshore 
Dimlington plant. This is the first time that BP has 
separated out maintenance services in this way. 
The contract is expected to generate revenue of 
approximately £20 million per annum.
In addition to securing these new awards, we have 
been successful in extending a number of our 
operations and maintenance contracts with oil majors 
and independents, including an extension to our Duty 
Holder contract with Venture Production to May 2011.

a	ser vice	that	delivers	reclaimed	wafers	
to	the	exacting	specifications	and	high	
standards required by today’s leading 
semiconductor manufacturers.
Our history
P ure	W afer	was	established	in	2000	by	
a	management	team	widely	experienced

backing of strategic investment from 
Venture Capital and industry partners.

and in February 2007 Pure Wafer completed 
the	acquisition	of	a	wafer	reclaim	facility	
in Arizona, the US.
Our facilities
The UK business operates from a state 
of the art, purpose built facility situated in 
a	technology	park	in	Swansea,	W ales	and	
is the most advanced plant of its kind in 
Europe. The size of the facility is in excess 
of 4,500m
2
 and includes over 2,000m
2
 
of production cleanrooms.
The	facility	in	P rescott,	Arizona	was	
constructed in 1997 and has received 
in excess of $50m of investment since 
then. This high-volume high-tech fab 
was	originally	designed	 for	200mm	and	
smaller	diameter	wafer	reclaim	ser vices,	
but	following	the	acquisition	by	P ure	W afer

We have installed the latest generation

the most advanced equipment as used 
by	integrated	chip	(IC)	and	prime	silicon	
producers. With the highest technical 
specifications,	we	are	positioned	to	offer	
the	most	effective	wafer	reclaim	ser vices	
to	our	customers	with	minimal	silicon	
removal. This enables our customers 
to maximise the number of times a 
test	wafer	can	be	reclaimed.
Pure Wafer is a worldwide leader in the provision 
of 300mm wafer reclaim services. These services 
enable semiconductor manufacturers to gain 
efficiencies through the increased use of silicon 
test wafers within their production processes.

Our process
At Pure Wafer our process for reclaiming test 
wafers	involves	the	following	k ey	stages:
› 	 	 Inspection	of	the	wafers	for	defects	and	
classification	by	type	of	contaminant	to	
be removed
›  Submersion in a precise mix of chemicals 
appropriate to remove the contaminant
›  Assessment	of	flatness	and	correction	
of defects using Pure Wafer’s advanced 
polishing processes
› Cleaning and drying
›  Final quality inspection and packaging 
for return to the customer
Wafer reclaim
During the many stages of the manufacturing process of 
semiconductors, 	 large 	 quantities 	 of 	 test 	 wafers 	 are 	 used 	 to 	 check

consumable in the manufacture of semiconductors and the ability 
to reclaim them through Pure Wafer’s advanced process provides 
manufacturers	with	the	oppor tunity	to	reduce	costs.

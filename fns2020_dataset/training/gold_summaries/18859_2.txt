Our news and commercial teams rose to the 
challenge of delivering world-class content 
throughout the year. From the Scottish 
Independence Referendum (see page 13)  
to the Commonwealth Games to Le Grand 
Depart of the Tour de France (see page 38),  
our teams stepped up and gave master classes 
in delivering excellence across our news sites, 
Twitter, Facebook and, of course, in print. 
Local campaign successes – including that of 
The Yorkshire Post’s award-winning ‘Loneliness: 
The Hidden Epidemic’ (see page 34) – cemented 
our titles at the heart of their communities. 
And, as ever, our teams led the way with 
breaking news and in-depth analysis. 
And in this most poignant of years we were 
proud to embark on a unique partnership with 
the Royal British Legion to mark the centenary 
of the outbreak of World War One and support 
British veterans (see page 35).  3 Johnston Press plc > Annual Report and Accounts 2014

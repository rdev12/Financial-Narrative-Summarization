Strategic and operational
Client service
During 2014 the business continued to develop existing and new service areas to further ensure that FDM services 
our customers’ changing requirements. During the year there was encouraging growth outside FDM’s core financial  
services sector, with Mounties deployed in government and local authorities, and the manufacturing, energy, transport  
and charity sectors.
People
The Group focused on strengthening its management, recruitment, sales and training teams. The result is the ability to 
locate and recruit the right individuals to join the Mountie programme, who can be expertly trained to deliver IT solutions 
on our client sites.
Mountie and geographic growth
Mountie headcount across the Group has seen strong growth with 1,539 Mounties placed on site at the beginning of 
week 52, an increase of 32% on 2013. The Group continues to increase its geographic presence. Operations commenced 
in both China and Ireland during 2014 and the Group secured Mountie growth in each geographic segment.
Mountie utilisation
A continued focus on monitoring and balancing the supply and demand for Mountie resource has resulted in a Mountie 
utilisation rate of 98.4% (2013: 97.6%), Mountie utilisation is the proportion of available time that Mounties are placed  
on site. 
Planning for growth
We invested in operational capacity and capabilities of the Group in the new locations of Toronto and Glasgow together 
with further training capacity in the New York office. The investment in the London office has seen the UK business 
further build the Group’s reputation and deliver more Mounties to customers.
Service areas
The UK Ex-Forces Programme was strengthened in January with the appointment of Colonel (Retd.) Stewart Sharman 
MBE, who served in the British Army for 25 years. In 2014 the programme placed over 50 ex-military personnel across a 
variety of roles and organisations, building upon the Group’s reputation as a valuable ex-forces employer which has been 
fostered in the US, where FDM was named CivilianJobs.com’s “Most Valuable Employer (“MVE”) for Military USA” and the 
Military Times’ “Best for Vets Employer USA” in 2014. 
Ownership
The Admission to the London Stock Exchange allows the Group to be free from borrowings and focus on investment in 
operations to facilitate planned growth. The development of the business and its successful Admission was recognised 
through the Group winning the UK Tech Awards 2014 “Private Equity Deal of the Year”.

Davenham has delivered profit
and earnings in the year
ended 30 June 2008 ahead of
last year and in line with
expectations despite an
increasingly challenging
economic environment. 
We continue to make progress in
consolidating the Group’s position as
the leading, independent asset based
lender to the UK SME sector. Our
recently added operations in Bristol
and Glasgow achieved good growth
and our investment in infrastructure
continued to underpin progress. 
Business Overview 
Davenham is a secured lender, with
relatively short term finance provided
to SMEs for property transactions; 
the acquisition of plant, machinery and
equipment; and the funding of stock,
debtors and short term letters of
credit. The Group has a diverse loan
portfolio with lending activities
organised into three product segments:
property finance, asset finance and
trade finance. The loan portfolio within
each product segment is broadly
spread by both sector and geography.
A key indicator of the broad spread of
our portfolio is that no individual
customer exposure accounts for more
than 1.4% of the overall portfolio.
Operational Review
The portfolio grew strongly in the first
half of the year, reducing in the second
half reflecting Davenham’s increasingly
conservative approach to underwriting
new business.
Since the start of the calendar year,
Davenham has continued to
experience credit slippage across its
risk classifications in the property
portfolio as disclosed in Note 17 of 
the Financial Statements. The Board
believes it is prudent to plan for
continuing challenging economic
conditions, and is budgeting for an
increase in the level of impairment
during the current financial year.
Since the autumn of 2007 we have
tightened our lending criteria,
particularly in respect to valuations,
marketing periods and loan value
metrics within the property book. 
We will continue to adapt our lending
criteria to reflect the changing
economic conditions.
In addition, we are re-pricing our
facilities to improve margins on more
conservatively written loans to respond
to the changing environment for credit
risk and our clients’ requirements. 
Loan Portfolio
At the year end, the loan portfolio,
including letters of credit, had
increased year on year by
approximately 5% to £284m (2007:
£271m). 
Over the year, our customer base
grew from 4,814 to 5,050 accounts,
representing a broad geographical and
sector spread. The overall average
exposure of the portfolio now stands
at £64,000 (2007: £65,000). 
Property Finance
The Property Finance loan book stood
at £155m at the year end (2007:
£150m), representing 55% of the
Group loan portfolio generating 55%
of the overall loan portfolio income for
the year. 
Typically, finance is provided for added
value development, refurbishment and
building projects with an average loan
to value of 80% and an average loan
size of £435,000. In most cases, loans
are not only secured against the
property being developed but also
supported by personal guarantees and
other properties and assets owned by
the developer. The portfolio as at 30
June 2008 had a broad geographical
spread, with 34% in the North West,
21% in the West and Midlands, 22%
in Yorkshire and the North East, with
the remainder across the South East
14%, South West 8% and Scotland 1%.
In October 2007, we promoted Anne
Murray to the position of Divisional
Director. She has eight years’
experience in the division and has
been instrumental in managing our
increasingly more cautious approach
across the property loan portfolio.
As previously reported, we have
decided to be far more selective in
underwriting new business
transactions through the adoption of
more conservative lending criteria.
This, combined with a significantly
reduced volume of good quality new

opportunities, is expected to reduce
our overall income from the property
book.
Asset Finance 
Asset Finance performed well, with the
loan book increasing from £65m to
£71m, representing 25% of the
Group’s year end loan portfolio and
22% of the overall loan portfolio
income during the year. During the
year, the average loan size was
£23,000 with an average duration of
41 months. Manor Credit, which was
acquired in June 2007, was
successfully integrated into the Group. 
During the year, we appointed a new
Divisional Director, Tim Morris, who
has extensive experience and contacts
in the credit industry and as a result
we expect our business referrer
contact base to increase.
We anticipate continuing growth in the
asset portfolio in the short to medium
term.
Trade Finance
The Trade Finance loan book grew 
by 4% from £56m to £58m (including
letters of credit), representing 20% 
of the Group’s year end loan 
portfolio and generated 23% of the
Group’s loan portfolio income during
the year. It remains broadly spread in
terms of its client sectors. The average
loan size during the year was
£389,000 with an average term of 
90 days.
Within the context of the natural
seasonality of the trade finance book,
we saw subdued trading in the first
few months of our financial year,
reflecting the abundance of credit
available at the top of the credit cycle
for these types of deals. However,
there has since been a marked
reversal of this trend. As mainstream
banks restrict overdraft financing at
this stage in the economic cycle, and
as our trade finance products offer an
alternative to such funding, we expect
to see increases in demand in this
division. 
National Footprint
During the year we consolidated our
existing geographical expansion,
growing our team across the UK from
179 to 184 as at 30 June 2008. 
We again saw growth in our London
office, which increasingly contributed
towards Group performance, as have
the recently established offices in
Bristol and Glasgow. 
Investment in Operational
Infrastructure
We have continued to expand our
operational infrastructure:
Risk
We have expanded our risk and
recoveries department to a total of 
14 dedicated people, from diverse
professional backgrounds including
insolvency practitioners and valuers,
and we have also enhanced our
portfolio management information
systems.
People
Davenham is defined by the skills 
and knowledge of its people; it is
dependent on their talent and
diligence in every aspect of the
business. Recognising the need to
compete for the highest calibre people
at every level within the Group, we
have continued to invest in training
and infrastructure to support staff
development. During the year, this has
taken the form of implementing
development and leadership
programmes for our senior managers
and the introduction of the employment
and remuneration infrastructure
required to support performance-
based incentivisation structures for 
our middle tier managers.
Marketing & Brand Development
Our marketing and brand are an
important support for our reputation
as a leader in our field amongst our
referrer network. During the year, 
we undertook some third party
research which, encouragingly,
highlighted Davenham’s reputation 
for professionalism and the positive
approach to dealing with its
stakeholders. Following this research,
we have updated our brand image
and marketing literature, albeit at
minimal investment cost.
Treasury & Funding
Under the governance of its Asset 
and Liability Committee (“ALCO”), 
the Group continues to use 
derivatives selectively. The ALCO
continues to give direction to the
Group treasury strategy, focusing on
the management of the Group’s
balance sheet, its funding mix, 
liquidity needs and interest rate
exposure. 
Funding
At the year end, £211m had been
drawn down from the Group’s £300m
borrowing facilities. The seasonal high
was £235m.
Davenham’s principal facilities are
committed until December 2009 
and they provide the Group with
sufficient funding for its plans during
2009. 
The Group continues to maintain
close, long-standing relationships with
its banking syndicate and aims to
complete its refinancing early in 2009,
resulting in an increase in the cost of
funding, in line with the increase in
financing costs seen across the credit
industry.
Current Trading and Outlook
We see positive signs of increased
new business within our asset and
trade finance products as SMEs seek
alternatives to increasingly scarce
funding from mainstream banks. 
In particular, we see attractive
opportunities for clients to release
cashflow for working capital 
purposes from the assets they 
already hold. 
Overview 7
However as highlighted by the more
recent statistics and political
commentary surrounding the property
market, we are recording a continued
increase in the level of impairment
within our own property portfolio. This
has been driven by increasing
pressure on valuations, longer
marketing periods and the decreasing
number of property sales. Accordingly,
this is currently expected to reduce
profits through a combination of lower
levels of new business and an
increase in impairment.
We expect the current economic
conditions to prevail for the medium
term, with continuing weakness in the
property market and the overall UK
economy, creating a challenging
operating environment. 
We have therefore taken decisive
action to meet the challenges of this
operating environment by
consolidating our operations and
controlling costs whilst focussing our
resources on managing the business
through these conditions. 
The combination of our strengthened
credit and risk function, our solid
balance sheet and our experienced
management team, leaves Davenham,
with a robust business model, well
placed to rise to the near term
challenges.

Overview

Anite plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2008
During the year, we continued in our strategy of transforming Anite
into a global software-based company.
Adjusted revenue and operating proﬁt from continuing operations
for the year (the Board’s preferred comparative measures) were
down 2.8% and 10.5% respectively when compared with the
previous year. This was wholly attributable to the handset testing
division of our Wireless business which was affected by difﬁcult
market conditions during the year. As a result, Wireless revenues
and proﬁts were reduced despite a strong performance from the
network testing (Nemo) unit, and action was taken to restructure
the handset business. Travel performed strongly, with better than
expected order intake, revenues and proﬁtability, while Public
Sector reported a good overall improvement in performance.
Further details of the Company’s performance are provided in the
Chief Executive’s review and in the ﬁnancial review.
Acquisitions and disposals
In july 2007 we disposed of our remaining German IT Services
business, Anite Deutschland, for a total consideration of £8.0m
paid in cash. We also sold Anite Travel Systems (Carus), a small
non-core Finnish subsidiary which was part of our Travel business,
for £1.0m, paid in cash.
We will continue to review the proﬁle of the Group to sharpen
its focus and deliver shareholder value, as well as considering
acquisition opportunities. We continue to work actively, with our
advisers, to explore a variety of strategic alternatives to remove, or
at least signiﬁcantly reduce, the scale of the discount in the market
valuation of our shares that reﬂects the ownership of several
businesses.
Results
Adjusted revenue from continuing operations was £15 4.0m (2007:
£158.4m). Adjusted operating proﬁt was £24.7m (2007: £27.6m)

operating proﬁt is stated before disposed businesses, share-based
payments, Telecoms restructuring costs and amortisation of

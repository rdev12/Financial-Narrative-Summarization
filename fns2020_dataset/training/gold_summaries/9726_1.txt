Chief Executive’s review

Overview 
The Group’s proﬁt performance in 2014 was 
affected by currency headwinds, weaker 
revenues in Alexander Proudfoot and the 
adverse impact on proﬁt of the change 
initiatives being implemented in that business 
to build a more ﬂexible model focused on 
proﬁtable growth. As a consequence, 
Alexander Proudfoot reported a small loss 
in 2014 but the Board believes that the current 
strategy for the business will deliver an 
improved performance in 2015 and beyond.
In Kurt Salmon, revenues on a constant currency 
basis increased in 2014 from the previous year 
and the underlying operating proﬁt margin also 
increased slightly. Continued weakness in its 
key French market has contrasted with 
impressive revenue growth in the North 
American operations, and the business is 
well placed to beneﬁt from further growth 
opportunities in 2015.
MCG operates globally, with 96% of revenues 
in 2014 coming from projects delivered outside 
the UK. The same proportion of the Group’s 
revenues in the year were billed in currencies 
other than Sterling and most of these currencies 
weakened signiﬁcantly (in terms of average 
exchange rates) between 2013 and 2014. 
All of the 6% reported reduction in Group 
revenues in to 2014 is attributable 
to currency translation.
MCG’s strategy is to exploit the platform 
provided by its existing businesses to drive 
organic revenue and margin growth. We have 
no current intention to make large scale 
acquisitions but will look to add capabilities 
where appropriate through smaller acquisitions 
and team hires. We will focus on opportunities 
in growth markets and industry sectors where 
we can readily exploit our strengths. The 
geographical spread of our businesses and 
our existing global ofﬁce infrastructure will 
support an increase in operational activity.

Results for the year
Total revenue for the year ended 31 December 
2014 was £242.8m, 6% lower than the 
previous year (2013: £257.3m). As noted, 
currency headwinds had a signiﬁcant effect 
on reported revenues in both of MCG’s 
businesses, accounting for all of the year 
on year reduction. Alexander Proudfoot’s 
revenues on a constant currency basis 
in 2014 were 4% lower than those in the 
previous year, with both ﬁrst and second half 
reported revenues in the order of £30m, in 
contrast to 2013, which beneﬁted from 
a much stronger second half. On the same 
constant currency basis, and excluding the 
Cleversys business sold in 2013, Kurt Salmon’s 
revenues increased by more than 4% from 
the previous year.
Underlying operating proﬁt in 2014 was £11.8m 
(2013: £21.2m), the £9.4m reduction principally 
reﬂecting the impact of lower revenues and 
margins in Alexander Proudfoot, resulting in 
a loss for the year as a whole in that business 
of £1.6m. Underlying operating proﬁt in Kurt 
Salmon was slightly lower than the previous 
year in absolute terms at £13.4m, although 
the margin improved slightly on 2013.
Underlying operating proﬁt for 2014 reﬂects 
a charge of £2.4m relating to share awards 
made to employees (2013: £3.9m). During 
the year 105 senior employees received 
awards over approximately 9.4 million shares 
in total, generally vesting over three years 
and conditional upon continued employment, 
and in some cases also subject to ﬁnancial 
or share price performance. At the year end 
there were outstanding awards in place over 
35.5 million shares relating to 141 employees 
(2013: 48.8 million shares and 135 employees). 
Some 24.0 million of these share awards, 
should they vest, are required to be satisﬁed 
from existing MCG shares and the other awards 
may be satisﬁed from existing or new shares. 
The Group’s employee beneﬁt trusts held 
8.5 million shares at the year end for this 
purpose and a further 2.4 million treasury 
shares were held by the Group which may be 
used to satisfy share awards. 
The Group’s reported non-recurring expenses 
of £2.9m in 2014 (2013: £1.5m), which are 
largely related to the change initiatives 
implemented in Alexander Proudfoot and 
mainly comprises redundancy costs and the 
costs associated with the departure of the 
former Chief Executive of that business in 
March 2014.
The charge for amortisation of acquired 
intangibles was £0.8m (2013: £2.2m). 
Consequently the proﬁt from operations 
decreased to £8.1m (2013: £17.5m), 
representing a margin of 3.3% (2013: 6.8%). 
The net interest expense was lower at 
£3.2m (2013: £3.5m). In accordance with 
IAS 19R the reported net interest charge for 
2014 includes an imputed charge in relation 
to deﬁned beneﬁt pensions of £0.8m 
(2013: £1.2m). 
The proﬁt before tax was lower at £4.9m 
(2013: £14.0m). The tax charge was £5.9m 
(2013: £4.9m). After adjusting for non-underlying 
items, the underlying effective tax rate was 
89% (2013: 34%). The signiﬁcant increase 
in the tax charge and the underlying tax rate 
in 2014 reﬂects the impact of project-speciﬁc 
tax charges in the Alexander Proudfoot 
business in certain geographies, together 
with revenue-based taxes or unrelieved losses 
in certain jurisdictions. A large component 
of the £5.9m tax charge for the year is a £2.8m 
non-cash item relating to the utilisation of part 
of the deferred tax asset relating to brought 
forward losses.
Consequently, there was a loss for the year 
attributable to the shareholders of £1.0m 
(2013: a proﬁt of £9.1m). Underlying earnings 
per share were 0.2p (2013: 2.4p) and the basic 
loss per share was 0.2p (2013: EPS 1.9p).

Balance sheet and dividend
The weak ﬁrst half revenue performance 
in Alexander Proudfoot resulted in net debt 
rising to £48.0m at the half year stage; however, 
strong cash generation from operations in the 
second half reduced net debt by £14.4m to 
£33.6m at the end of the year (2013: £39.8m). 
This equates to 2.04x adjusted EBITDA for 
2014 as measured for the purpose of the 
Group’s borrowing facility, an increase from 
1.46x at the previous year end, reﬂecting lower 
proﬁts in 2014. As a precautionary measure 
in order to provide some additional headroom 
the maximum leverage covenant has been 
increased at the next two quarterly testing 
dates in March and June 2015, from 2.75x to 3x. 
Positive working capital movements meant that 
cash generated by operations was £17.6m, 
signiﬁcantly higher than in the previous year 
(2013: £6.7m).
During 2014 the Group’s employee beneﬁt 
trusts purchased 3.8 million of the Company’s 
ordinary shares of 1p each for a total 
consideration of £1.0m. 
The interim dividend for 2014 of 0.23p per share 
was paid on 6 January 2015. The Board is 
recommending, subject to shareholder approval, 
an unchanged total dividend for the year 
of 0.825p per share. The directors therefore 
recommend, subject to shareholder approval, 
a ﬁnal dividend for 2014 of 0.595p per share to 
be paid on 7 July 2015 to shareholders on the 
register on 15 May 2015. 
Summary 
The Group’s reported results for 2014 are in line 
with our revised expectations highlighted in 
the trading update on 6 October 2014. The 
primary driver of what is a disappointing overall 
result for the Group was the performance of 
Alexander Proudfoot, which experienced a 
year of planned change and weak revenues, 
and strong currency headwinds. 
Alexander Proudfoot has been a successful 
and highly proﬁtable business for many years 
but it has always suffered from volatility in its 
revenues from quarter to quarter and has not 
been able to grow revenues consistently year 
on year. The MCG Board decided in March 2014 
to make a number of changes designed in 
part to mitigate revenue volatility, but primarily 
to restore the growth potential of business 
for the longer term. This has involved some 
investment and additional cost, and consequent 
margin erosion in 2014, which unfortunately 
has coincided with a year in which revenues 
were weak in both the ﬁrst and second halves. 
As a result the business has reported a small 
underlying operating loss for the ﬁrst time in 
more than a decade. Good progress has been 
made with the “growth plan” initiatives so 
far and these continue in 2015, with some 
further adverse margin impact this year but 
alongside an encouraging revenue trend 
at this stage of the year, which, if maintained, 
should restore the business to proﬁtability.
Kurt Salmon’s performance provided a 
contrast between its two largest markets 
in France and North America, which each 
produced around 40% of divisional revenues. 
In North America both the retail and consumer 
goods and the healthcare practices produced 
excellent underlying revenue growth in 
US Dollars and good margins. In France 
activity levels were broadly ﬂat year on year, 
although total revenues in Euros were slightly 
lower than 2013 in a market which continues 
to be affected by macro economic weakness 
and shows few clear signs of growth. In overall 
terms Kurt Salmon increased underlying 
revenues on a constant currency basis by more 
than 4% and slightly increased its underlying 
operating proﬁt margin, but currency headwinds 
led to a reported decrease in revenue and 
proﬁt in absolute terms.
Net debt has decreased year on year to £33.6m 
(2013: £39.8m) and remains at a comfortable 
level in relation to the Group’s bank facility and 
covenant requirements. The normal phasing 
of cash ﬂows means that indebtedness tends 
to increase towards the half year stage with 
stronger cash generation in the second half 
of the year, as was the case in 2014.

Outlook
Kurt Salmon has had a good start to 2015, with 
continuing strong demand in North America. 
In France our business has seen some beneﬁt 
in the ﬁrst two months of the year from a slightly 
more optimistic outlook amongst some clients, 
perhaps partly in anticipation of a positive 
impact on businesses from a weaker Euro 
and Quantitative Easing in the Eurozone. 
The current order book in Kurt Salmon is 
slightly higher than the same period last year. 
For Kurt Salmon overall, we expect the trends 
we saw in 2014 to continue in 2015. As we 
increase the pace of recruitment this year 
in our growth markets, there is likely to be 
some negative margin impact in the short 
term before new senior employees become 
fully productive.
Alexander Proudfoot has had a satisfactory start 
to 2015. There is a promising pipeline of 
opportunities at this stage, although the current 
order book is a little lower than the same stage 
last year and the rate of order input will need 
to build from current levels to meet our 
objectives over the course of the year as a 
whole. The new and enhanced offerings which 
we have developed have had some recent 
success with clients. The investment and 
change initiatives that we launched in 2014 are 
continuing this year and will continue have some 
adverse effect on proﬁtability, as we build a 
ﬁrmer platform to generate revenue growth. 
Recent shifts in exchange rates, if they persist, 
are likely to have some impact on MCG’s 
reported results in 2015 compared with 2014. 
The Group’s reported results will beneﬁt from 
a stronger US Dollar, but a weaker Euro will 
have the opposite effect on reported revenues 
and proﬁts in Sterling.
We will continue to work to develop 
our businesses with selective investment 
and recruitment in those sectors and 
geographies where there are good 
prospects for proﬁtable growth in order 
to deliver value to our shareholders.

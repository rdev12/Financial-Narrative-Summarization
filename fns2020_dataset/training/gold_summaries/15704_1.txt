 Chief Executive’s review
12 Tibbett & Britten Group plc Annual report and accounts 2002
This, together with our clear
strategic focus and key market
leadership positions, continues
to represent a sound basis for
sustained growth.
During 2002 we further
strengthened our management
teams and streamlined our
organisational structures. 
The appointment of Saad
Hammad to lead the European
team will facilitate the
integration of our activities
across Europe. We continue
to invest in information
technology and in the
development of our people.
Macro-economic and 
geo-political changes drive the
development of trans-national
manufacturing and retailing.
Global sourcing and the
complexities of the extended
supply chain add further to
the potential for outsourcing
and change management in
both our established core
markets and our strategic
development markets like
China and Latin America.
The Americas
Operations in the Americas
continue to show strong
growth. At constant exchange
rates, turnover was up by
11% to £605.3m and operating
proﬁt before goodwill
amortisation increased by 8%
to £15.9m. During the year
organic growth of £56.0m
more than replaced the
turnover from the Kmart
contract, discontinued in 
May 2001, and the Oshawa
contract, which was taken in-
house following its acquisition
by Sobey’s. The Dimalsa
business in Mexico, acquired
in March 2002, is meeting
expectations and before
goodwill amortisation
contributed £1.9m to
operating proﬁt. 
In North America we continue
to reinforce our market
leadership position in grocery
retail, whilst extending our
presence in the non-food
retail and fast moving
consumer product
manufacturing sectors.
In the United States we
expanded our activities in 
Hams Hall
Extending the customer
franchise. Sainsbury’s 
giant Hams Hall ‘fulﬁlment
factory’ just outside
Birmingham, UK, is shown
in the ﬁnal stage of
construction. This
automated 855,000 sq ft
ambient and chilled
distribution centre is now
the largest operated by the
Group in the UK and Ireland.

Chief Executive
The Group’s emphasis on mass consumer related
sectors and our open-book business model (which
accounts for 70% of activities) provides resilience
against a general economic slowdown. Tibbett & Britten Group plc Annual report and accounts 2002 13
the grocery sector with a full
year of operations for two 
7-Eleven regional distribution
centres. We have also
enhanced our position in 
the consumer product
manufacturing sector with 
the start-up of four new sites
for Procter & Gamble and the
operation of three facilities for
ConAgra – one of the largest
food manufacturers in the
United States. During the year
we commenced operations 
at two sites for JC Penney,
reinforcing our presence 
in the clothing sector. 
Within the Americas we
continue to invest in
information technologies 
to increase efﬁciency across
the supply chain. The
deployment of sophisticated
demand-planning tools 
have successfully reduced
customer inventories and
increased service levels, 
and the implementation of
our web-based electronic
procurement programme has
led to signiﬁcant purchasing
savings for a number of
clients. Our transport
management solution,
freightSmart, is using the
latest technology to reduce
costs and increase service
levels. The web-enabled
liquorconnect.com initiative
has resulted in more than
75% of our Western Canadian
licensed liquor business being
booked in real time over the
internet with resultant savings
throughout the supply chain.
In Canada a third, new one
million sq ft distribution centre
for Wal-Mart was completed
early in the year and already
the ﬁrst two sites are being
extended. We delivered the
paid consultancy project for
the Canadian Department 
of National Defence (DND) 
on the beneﬁts of outsourcing
their military supply chains,
and this work conﬁrmed the
savings indicated by the
earlier pilot study. Regrettably
the Canadian Government has
chosen not to proceed with
the project.
The acquisition of the Dimalsa
business in Mexico and Puerto
Rico was completed at the
end of March. We have
successfully translated 
our customer franchise 
into Mexico and since the
acquisition have opened three
Procter & Gamble regional
distribution sites. The
relationship with Kelloggs 
has been extended with 
the opening of a new site 
in Mexicali and additional 
new business has been won
with Rubbermaid and Hamilton
Beach, to commence in 2003.
During the year we improved
operational efﬁciencies 
through deployment of
management and systems
expertise from our North
American business. 
After restructuring early 
in the year, the business 
in Argentina is now trading
proﬁtably.
Europe
Our European business
outperformed a generally
slower market with turnover,
at constant exchange rates,
increasing by 9% to £837.8m.
However operating proﬁt
before goodwill amortisation
declined by 15% to £18.1m,
due mainly to the costs
associated with closing the
shared-user UK Fashion
network and increased
insurance premiums across
Europe. These events
masked the good progress
being made in developing 
the underlying businesses.
In the UK and Ireland we
continued to reinforce our
market position, extending
our partnerships with major
clients and broadening 
our overall customer base
through the application of
innovative solutions to their
supply chain needs. During
the year we strengthened 
the management team and
established a single support
infrastructure to serve all 
our UK activities. 
The 9% turnover growth in
UK and Ireland is supported
by the full-year contribution 
of the new Tesco distribution
centre at Thurrock and the
B&Q import warehouse 
at Scunthorpe. In addition, 
a number of new operations
commenced during the year
including the Sainsbury’s
distribution centre at Corby,
the B&Q distribution centre 
at Radlett and new operations
for Ben Sherman, Gap 
and LVMH.
In August, after providing
support services to
Remington since May 2001,
the Group was awarded an
exclusive long term logistics
contract. In early 2003 our
relationship with the Big Food
Group was enhanced by the
award of a long term contract
to manage the warehousing
and delivery for both Booker
Cash & Carry and Iceland
supermarkets throughout
Scotland, Northern England
and Northern Ireland.
After the closure of the
shared-user network
operations, the UK-based
Fashion business has been
reshaped and is actively
SCM
In Canada, member company
SCM completed the third new
one million sq ft distribution
centre for Wal-Mart, the world’s
largest retailer. SCM has
provided exclusive warehousing
and distribution services to
Wal-Mart in Canada since 1994
and in Germany since 1999.
Mexico
Since the acquisition of Dimalsa
– Mexico’s largest logistics
service provider – in March, 
the Group has introduced both
management and systems
from the North American
business. As a result, we are
already successfully translating
our customer franchise.

developing into mainland
Europe, where there is an
identiﬁed pipeline of new
business opportunities. 
We are also working to
extend our supply chain offer
and consolidate our position
in key offshore manufacturing
centres in Romania, Morocco,
Turkey and China. 
In April 2002 a full actuarial
valuation conﬁrmed that the
UK deﬁned beneﬁt pension
scheme was fully funded
under the Minimum Funding
Requirement regulations
(MFR). We have now closed
the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme 
to new entrants and increased
employee contributions.
Under FRS 17 accounting
rules the scheme showed 
a net deﬁcit of £72.1m at 
31 December 2002.
In mainland Europe, turnover,
at constant exchange rates,
increased by 12% to £225.3m
as we continued to develop
our operations in France,
Benelux, Spain and Eastern
Europe. Following a strong
start, operating proﬁt declined
in the second half due to
higher insurance costs and
the exceptionally poor summer
that affected our closed-book
drinks and ice-cream
operations in France and Spain.
During the year we extended
our fashion sector expertise
and customer franchise across
Europe. Major new business
included an operation to 
co-ordinate, plan and manage
all primary transport across
Europe and the Middle East
for Levi Strauss & Co and 
the start-up of a major textile
distribution centre supporting
over 2,300 retail outlets
nationwide for Intermarché.
Other additions in the fashion
sector included Hugo Boss
and Gap in France, Forum and
Women’s Secret in Spain and
a further Corteﬁel business
which will commence in 2003.
In the grocery sector we
strengthened our relationships
with major trans-national
operators such as Auchan,
opening new operations in
both France and Hungary. 
We continued development in
the fresh produce sector with
the extension of the Valencia
site in Spain. In Germany a
second distribution centre for
Wal-Mart became operational
in March 2003. In Benelux we
successfully reduced our cost
base and further improved
customer service levels.
In Central and Eastern Europe
our Hungarian business
performed exceptionally 
well and successfully opened
new operations for Delhaize,
Auchan and added Bestfoods.
In the Czech Republic we
commenced operations for
Interspar, but in Poland, the
difﬁcult economic situation
depressed customer volumes,
resulting in our closed book
operation at Raciborz
operating below capacity. 
International
Our International operations 
in Asia, the Middle East and
Africa continue to develop
rapidly. At constant exchange
rates, turnover was up by 42%
to £73.8m and operating proﬁt
increased by 113% to £1.3m. 
In China, a key emerging
market for the Group, our
50:50 joint venture with
Unilever
RFID ‘smart tagging’ trials were
undertaken in 2002, involving 
the distribution of six-packs of
Lynx deodorant for Lever 
Fabergé – Unilever’s home and
personal care products company.
During the year we extended our fashion
sector expertise and customer franchise
across Europe. Major new business included
an operation to co-ordinate, plan and manage
all primary transport across Europe and the
Middle East for Levi Strauss & Co...
Remington
After a successful 15-month
project to streamline its UK
supply chain, the Group was
awarded a new long term
logistics contract by Remington. Tibbett & Britten Group plc Annual report and accounts 2002 15
Hutchison Whampoa
continues to grow rapidly.
Operations include the
management of an asset
light, national distribution
network already delivering to
over 350 cities across China –
mainly on behalf of major
international manufacturers,
including Procter & Gamble,
Warner Lambert and Siemens.
Over the past three years 
we have also established 
a signiﬁcant presence in the
management of domestic
supply chains within the retail
sector for customers including
B&Q, Park ‘N’ Shop, and 
Wu Mei. During the year 
we commenced warehouse
operations for P&G at Chengdu
and Tianjin. Earlier this year
we opened a major purpose-
built warehouse for retailer
HuaPu and in April 2003 
we will take over the
management of a third P&G
warehouse in Shanghai. There
is a strong pipeline of new
business from both retailers
and manufacturers.
We have extended our
activities into other parts 
of Asia through the
establishment of a joint
venture in Thailand with
David’s Asia and in Malaysia
with Kontena Nasional. 
These joint ventures
complement our existing
activities in Taiwan, Hong
Kong and Singapore. 
In the Middle East our
partnership with the Olayan
Group in Saudi Arabia is well
established and is providing
supply chain management
services to a wide range 
of consumer product
companies, including Colgate-
Palmolive, Henkel, Kimberly-
Clark and Kraft Foods. In
Dubai we have taken over the
management of the Al Futtaim
logistics operations, which
provide supply chain
management support to 
a range of franchisee
operations in the region.
The South Africa business
continues to develop
satisfactorily, helped by 
the full-year contribution from
the Kinesis business that
specialises in supply chain
management services for
ethical pharmaceutical 
and personal healthcare
manufacturers. The i2
Technologies transport
management software is now
fully deployed and is not only
reducing costs but is also a
major source of new business.
Other new business during
the year included taking over
the management of the Kraft
national distribution centre
near Johannesburg.
Mike Arrowsmith
Chief Executive
Olayan
The Olayan Tibbett & Britten
joint venture at Al Khobar,
Saudi Arabia, extended its
customer base. Elsewhere,
Tibbett & Britten Middle
East was formed as a wholly
Group-owned entity,
responding to increasing
opportunities for further
growth in the region.
Corteﬁel
Our fashion sector operations
continue to grow across
Europe and elsewhere. 
During the year we were
appointed by Corteﬁel Group
Women’s Secret to manage
a central warehouse serving 
the prominent Spanish fashion
company’s domestic and
international stores.
Operations include the management of
an asset light, national distribution network
already delivering to over 350 cities across
China – mainly on behalf of major
international manufacturers...

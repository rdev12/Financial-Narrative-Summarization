 The year ended 31 December 2011 was another year of progress for the Group. Operational revenues and EBITDA
have progressed steadily and according to plan, with overall revenues increasing by 19.5% in continuing facilities to
£64,618,000 (2010: £54,058,000). Both of our flagship facilities, CircleBath and Circle’s Nottingham NHS
Treatment Centre, achieved impressive clinical quality and patient recommendation metrics, which we believe rate
amongst the best in the UK. Our track record was affirmed by the Government approving the ground-breaking
Hinchingbrooke contract, allowing for the first time the independent sector to run an entire NHS hospital. In a
relatively short space of time, Circle has created an unrivalled platform.
CircleBath, our first independent hospital which opened in March 2010, has performed well in many measures.
Revenues grew by 94.2% and gross margins improved by 34.4 percentage points between the second half of 2010
(when the hospital completed its first full six months of trading) and the second half 2011, as existing operations
grew and processes matured. At the same time, we maintained an average of 99.4% patient recommendation for
the six months ended 31 December 2011 and a zero infection rate. CircleBath also became the first hospital in the
country to gain a national award for Best Building, an international award for Best Public Space globally, and a
regional award for Best Customer Service, beating stiff competition from some of the best five star hotels in the
country.
Revenue in Circle’s Nottingham NHS Treatment Centre, one of the largest day surgical centres in Europe, increased
by 6.6% to £51,185,000 (2010: £48,000,000), whilst operating profits were up by 85.0% to £2,390,000 (2010:
£1,292,000). Our Nottingham operation has gained national acclaim from policymakers and politicians for its
record 18.5% average compounded productivity gain and outstanding quality metrics, including readmissions after
day surgery being seven times better than the national Independent Sector Treatment Centre (‘ISTC’) threshold, and
patient recommendations averaging 99.1%. The contract to run the Nottingham Treatment Centre expires in July
2013 and we are awaiting details of the proposed re-tendering of the contract. If the re-tendering process does not
commence imminently, we expect that an extension to the current contract is a reasonable prospect.
We have been heartened by overwhelming staff, stakeholder and community support around the launch of our
franchise contract in Hinchingbrooke. In an NHS first, around 1,200 of the 1,700 hospital employees came together
to create the improvement plan for their own hospital. Collectively, they came up with the audacious goal of
becoming one of the best district general hospitals in the country within two years, and a detailed plan to achieve
this. Early metrics are encouraging with Accident and Emergency performance consistently above 98.0%,
approximately a 10.0% improvement since the beginning of February, making Hinchingbrooke the top performer in
the region.
It has also been a good year for our development pipeline, with funding deployed for CircleReading’s construction
and commissioning, and land acquisition in Manchester. Construction of CircleReading is expected to be completed
by the end of May 2012, on time and on budget, and we look forward to opening our doors to serve patients there
in the second half of 2012.
The politics of healthcare in the UK is often turbulent, yet the direction of travel has been encouragingly consistent.
Since Circle was founded, the operating environment has improved immeasurably. Significant gains in the number
of patients being offered choice, the opening of secondary and community services to independent sector provision,
and our own ground-breaking contract to run an entire NHS hospital, all confirm that there are increasing
opportunities for plural provision of NHS services.
Circle has made a number of contributions to opening up this market, with three significant and successful
campaigns. Firstly, we referred the issue of consultants’ contracted hours to the NHS Co-operation and Competition
Panel (‘CCP’) which accepted our argument that consultants should have the freedom to practice at the location
of their patients’ choice. Secondly, we referred Primary Care Trusts (‘PCT’s) that were restricting NHS patients’
choice to the CCP, which again ruled in favour of patient choice. Thirdly, we referred anti-competitive practices in
the private sector to the Office of Fair Trading (‘OFT’), which accepted our arguments and referred the entire sector
to the Competition Commission for a market investigation. It is widely accepted that UK healthcare needs more
efficient solutions, so we are confident that the environment will continue to improve.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S
REPORT
Market conditions 
The year ended 30 April 2003 has been
a very good one for our business.
Although market conditions have been
competitive, our focus on producing
modern, highly differentiated software
applications has ensured that we have
maintained a high hit rate in public
procurement programmes and we have
continued to sell strongly back into our
existing customer base.
In our target markets and most
notably in the United Kingdom,
Ireland and Australasia, national
governments have shown a
preparedness to invest heavily in
modern application systems and
broadband networks to provide
information to improve the quality 
of healthcare services.
Our strategy of focusing on being a
leading application content provider,
fitted and continues to fit well with the
procurement plans of these
governments.  The published
programme of investment in the United
Kingdom for example, involves
separating the roles of Application
Service Provider (ASP) and application
content provider with the former being
the province of the large service
organisations and the latter being the
domain of the innovative health systems
software specialists, such as iSOFT.
This approach is being emulated in
other countries where healthcare
modernisation and reform is a high
priority for government.
We have executed on our strategy well
over the last year and our positioning
against government stimulated market
developments is very promising. SECTION FOUR_PAGE TWELVE

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S
REPORT
Our financial performance 
for the year 
The market conditions described suit
our business model and that is reflected
in iSOFT’s results for the financial year
ended 30 April 2003.  
Our turnover for the year grew to
£91.5m representing an overall
growth rate of 52.2% over the
previous period, of which 31.2%
represented organic growth from
existing business operations.
Profitability also showed strong
progression with operating profit for 
the year ended 30 April 2003 of
£21.0m, an increase of 59.3% over the
previous year.  Operating profit margins
were increased to 22.9% from 21.9%
despite strong competition and
notwithstanding the amounts expended
during the year in the development 
of our leading application product
portfolio and the enhancement of our
operating structures.
Product development
Over the past year we have continued
to invest heavily in our application
software portfolio for healthcare
provider organisations.  Approximately
£7.9m was invested in product
development representing 8.6% 
of turnover for the year ended 
30 April 2003.  
Our relationship with Microsoft
Corporation continues to strengthen
and they remain our most important
technology partner.  
We are acknowledged by Microsoft
as a leading developer in .NET
architectures and continue to be a
launch partner for their step change
technology releases.
During the year we worked closely with
Microsoft to ensure that our
applications can be packaged up for
sale to the third party service
organisations who in turn offer
application services for consumption 
by end user customers.  This has
involved re-engineering a number of our
applications and the completion of 
this programme was announced in 
March 2003 at the HC2003 Conference
in Harrogate.  The resultant i-series of
applications has been well received and
recognised in our customer base and
our markets generally as the most 
modern, technology relevant suite of
health information system solutions
available today.
In addition, I am delighted to report that
since the balance sheet date, we have
announced a joint marketing and
development agreement with Eclipsys
Corporation of the United States. 
iSOFT purchased the United Kingdom
and Australian operations of Eclipsys in
May 2001 and this new agreement
represents the continuation of a
relationship which is strategically
important for iSOFT as it allows us to
bring the best of North American
thinking into the clinical components of
our applications, where appropriate. SECTION FOUR_PAGE THIRTEEN

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S
REPORT
Partnering with service organisations
The scale of information technology
modernisation planned for healthcare
providers in the United Kingdom is
unprecedented and is being emulated in
other reforming healthcare economies.
As the United Kingdom and other
governments look to introduce new
national information services to support
improvements in healthcare, including
an electronic health record for each
citizen, electronic booking of
appointments and electronic transfer of
prescriptions, it is clear that the large
service organisations have a key
management role to play.
At iSOFT we were early to recognise
that offering packaged applications
in support of the provision of new
healthcare information services 
was a natural development of our
business strategy.  Over the last 
year, we have spent a considerable
amount of time working with large
service organisations that wish to
invest in becoming ASPs to the
healthcare sector.  
The product of this work is that our
software has been adopted as the first
choice applications suite for many of
the leading service organisations that
have announced their intention to be
such ASPs.  
This is further recognition of our
leadership as an application content
provider in the healthcare market.
Outlook 
As described at the outset, market
conditions are very dynamic.  At iSOFT,
we welcome the extent and the pace of
this change as it represents opportunity
for further growth of our business as we
make progress at the expense of those
competitors less able to respond.  
In future, the financial value of
procurements is likely to rise in all our
markets as governments seek to
progress modernisation of information
technology more rapidly.  With 
scaled-up procurements comes the
need for large service provider
organisations to adopt the role of 
prime contractor and provide the
particular expertise and resource
required to manage and deliver 
projects of this size. 
iSOFT is well positioned to continue
winning the application component 
of major contracts where the
decision criteria involve the issues 
of innovation, relevance of
application, development capacity,
market presence, track record and
financial standing.  
Working with large service organisations
will also be characterised by effective
risk sharing so that our exposure is
confined to those areas where we have
shown we can manage well.
The outlook for iSOFT in these changing
times is, therefore, very positive.

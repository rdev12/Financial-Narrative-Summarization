Chairman’s statement
Bob Holt
Chairman
Introduction
I am very pleased to report that  
DX’s maiden full year results since  
its Admission to AIM are in line with 
market forecasts. This has been a 
year of transformation for DX with  
the successful flotation on AIM on  
27 February 2014 and the associated 
placing substantially strengthening 
the company’s financial position.  
The period covered includes eight 
months under private equity 
ownership and four months as an 
AIM-quoted company with a 
recapitalised balance sheet. DX  
is now very well placed financially  
to pursue its growth strategy, 
underpinned by a strong balance 
sheet and good cash flows.
There have been a number of key 
elements behind the trading 
improvement in the year, including 
further steady organic growth, 
continuing efficiency improvements, 
the beginning of the consolidation  
of DX’s distribution network and the 
continued turnaround at DX Freight, 
the underperforming delivery 
business which we acquired in 2012 
(formerly known as Nightfreight).  
The acquisition of DX Freight added 
significant scale to our operations 
and substantially increased our 
exposure to the fast-growing parcels 
and freight market. There is still much 
to be done in turning around this 
business, which suffered from years 
of under-investment and numerous 
management changes before we 
acquired it. However we have firmly 
established a programme of 
investment and transformation which 
we will be implementing over the 
next three years. The process of 
bringing DX Freight together with  
our wider operations to create a 
‘OneDX’ proposition, underpinned by 
common technology and systems, 
will establish a stronger platform for 
long term growth.
Financial results
For the year to 30 June 2014, total 
revenues increased by 2.1% to   DX (Group) plc Annual Report 2014 | 5 www.thedx.co.uk
Strategic Report Directors’ Report Financial Statements
£312.0 million with revenues from 
ongoing activities increasing by  
4% to £304.2 million.
Earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation 
(EBITDA) were £34.4 million (2013: 
£34.4 million) in line with market 
forecasts. However, during the year, 
we completed a change in the way 
that we finance the vehicle fleet at 
DX Freight and, taking account of 
this, on a pro-forma basis, EBITDA 
increased by £0.8 million after all 
finance and operating lease costs,  
a rise of 2.4% year-on-year.
Pre-tax profit before exceptional 
items for the year was £7.1 million 
(2013: £0.3 million). DX listed at the 
end of February therefore for eight 
months of the year to 30 June 2014 
we traded with a now replaced debt 
structure, including high coupon 
shareholder debt, all of which has 
now been eliminated. Pre-tax profit 
before this shareholder-related 
interest increased by 31% to £21.9 
million (2013: £16.7 million).
The reported loss before tax of £55.7 
million (2013: loss of £1.9 million) was 
after exceptional costs of £13.6 
million (2013: £2.2 million), mainly 
relating to impairment charges (see 
note 9), and non-recurring costs of 
£49.2 million (see note 10), which 
largely related to the pre-Admission 
repayment of a debt instrument.
Basic earnings per share for the year 
before exceptional items were 5.1p 
(2013: loss of 12.2p). The reported 
losses per share were 70.2p (2013: 
loss of 22.9p).
Cash flows and banking
DX generates strong cash flows, with 
a significant weighting to the second 
half of the financial year. Adjusting 
for £57.3 million of exceptional costs, 
cash generated from operating 
activities was £23.8 million (2013: 
£28.9 million). 
DX’s debt structure has been 
simplified on Admission to AIM with 
the repayment in full of all loan 
instruments. New banking facilities 
of £23.0 million have been agreed, 
including a £13.0 million revolving 
capital facility. At 30 June 2014, net 
debt was £12.2 million, equivalent to 
35% of EBITDA. DX’s net debt is 
expected to reduce over the next 
financial year.
Dividend
The Board is pleased to propose a 
final dividend of 2p per share. As the 
company was only listed for four of 
the 12 months ended 30 June 2014, 
this represents a pro-forma, post 
Admission equivalent full year 
dividend of 6p per share. Subject  
to shareholder approval, the 
dividend will become payable on  
12 December 2014 to shareholders 
on the register on 14 November 2014 
and will have an ex-dividend date of 
13 November 2014.
DX’s Annual General Meeting will  
be held on 4 November 2014 at 
10.00am at DX House, Ridgeway, 
Iver, Bucks, SL0 9JQ.
Board changes
In July, we announced that Non-
executive Chairman, David Hoare, 
was stepping down from both the 
Board and the company after 
overseeing four and a half years of 
transformational change at DX. On 
behalf of all his colleagues I would 
like to record our thanks to David for 
the enormous contribution he has 
made to DX and for the support he 
has provided to the Board. 
I am delighted to have assumed the 
role of Chairman and look forward to 
reporting on the company’s further 
progress in future years.
In July, we also welcomed Paul 
Murray to the Board as a Non-
executive Director. Paul has over 
25 years’ senior level experience of 
the transport and logistics industry. 
We intend to make a further Non-
executive Director appointment in 
due course.
Our people
DX’s success is founded on its 
people and the teams across DX’s 
operations have worked hard and 
shown great commitment to the 
improvements we are making to the 
business as we move towards our 
‘OneDX’ goal. I would like to thank 
everyone at DX for their efforts over 
the year.
Outlook
Looking ahead, while we face a 
number of challenges, including the 
structural decline of the mail market, 
the vast majority of DX’s revenues is 
in the growth areas of parcels, 
freight and outsized deliveries. The 
company has opportunities to grow 
profitability, supported by a strong 
balance sheet.
We continue to focus on the ongoing 
turnaround of DX Freight, which will 
have a positive impact on group 
margins as the turnaround comes 
through over the next three years. 
We are also concentrating on 
increasing our penetration of market 
segments requiring our more 
specialist services, including our 
time-sensitive, mission critical/high 
value delivery services and our 
2-Man delivery services.
I am pleased to report that the new 
financial year has started well. As 
previously stated, historically, there is 
a strong weighting in trading profit 
to the second half of the financial 
year. The company remains well-
positioned to continue to deliver on 
its growth strategy and I look 
forward to providing a further 
update on DX’s progress at our 
Annual General Meeting.

Chairman

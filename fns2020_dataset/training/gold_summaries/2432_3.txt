 13 BrainJuicer Group PLC  Annual Report & Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2009
BrainJuicer
®
 has had another good 
year in financial, operational and 
strategic terms.  Driven entirely by 
continued organic growth, 2009 
revenues increased by 27% to  
£11,814,000.  Operating profit  
also grew by 27% to £1,645,000.
These results were achieved 
against a difficult economic 
background which had an impact 
on many of our clients.  Overall 
spending on market research 
declined in 2009 for the first 
time in many years, and so to 
generate such strong growth 
was no mean achievement.
A look at where our revenues 
and profits arose in 2009 helps 
to illustrate the extent to which 
BrainJuicer
®
 is becoming a truly 
international business.  For the 
first time last year total overseas 
revenues exceeded those 
generated in the UK, reflecting 
in particular strong growth in our 
US business and encouraging 
progress in our new offices in 
Switzerland and Germany.   
Non-UK operating profits also  
increased substantially both in 
absolute terms and as a proportion 
of the total.  We intend to extend  
our geographic footprint further 
by opening new offices in  
China and Brazil in 2010.
We are making progress by 
developing innovative products 
for our clients, which include 
many of the world’s largest 
buyers of market research, 
and by consistently providing 
them with an excellent service.  
Revenues from our distinctive, 
leading edge products, which we 
call “Juicy” products, rose by two 
thirds in 2009.  Levels of client 
satisfaction remain very high as 
evidenced by the continued high 
level of repeat business (clients 
generating around 80% of 2008 
revenue returned in 2009).
BrainJuicer
®
 continues to strike 
what we believe is an appropriate 
balance between delivering 
profit growth in the short term 
and at the same time laying the 
foundations for the substantially 
larger business which we intend 
to become over the next several 
years.  As well as generating 
good growth in profits in 2009, 
we continued to invest heavily 
for a business or our size.  We 
increased headcount in our client 
servicing, operations and product 
development teams.  After the 
year end, in February 2010, we 
announced the appointment 
of Alex Batchelor to the newly 
created position of Chief 
Operating Officer.  Alex brings 
a wealth of relevant experience 
and skills to BrainJuicer
®
, and his 
appointment will enable our Chief 
Executive, John Kearon, to devote 
more of his time to driving growth.
Our investment in generating, 
testing and validating new 
products was stepped up again 
in 2009, an essential element 
in the process of increasing 
our market share with major 
multinational clients.  We have also 
once again committed significant 
funds to enhancing efficiency 
and scalability of our technology 
platform.  A new online survey 
platform is nearing completion.
Market conditions are likely to 
remain difficult in 2010.  We 
nonetheless intend to deliver 
further progress, while continuing 
to invest in those resources 
which will, we believe, enable 
BrainJuicer
®
 to establish itself as 
one of the world’s leading market 
research firms.

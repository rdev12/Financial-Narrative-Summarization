HIGHLIGHTS
OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS
•  Strategic step: The first stage of 
transition was successfully completed 
as Elite Dangerous launched. At  
the end of August 2015 it had sold 
approximately 825,000 paid units 
(excluding free ‘demo’ units) and 
generated 84% of Group revenues  
via a self-publishing business model 
including associated merchandise.
•  S e l f - pu bl i s h i ng c o n t r i bu t e d 
significantly to record revenues,  
up 139% to £22.8 million, a cash 
increase of £2.1 million to £10.5 
million, EBITDA up 1,790% to £6.1 
million and an adjusted operating 
profit up 171% to £2.5 million  
whilst still in transition.
•  The Group expanded the reach of  
Elite Dangerous through subsequent 
releases on Mac and Xbox One 
platforms in addition to PC, and via 
the Steam and Xbox Live distribution 
channels in addition to the Group’s  
own online store. The Group’s  
COBRA technology facilitated the 
significant technological and logistical 
achievement of simultaneous 
multi-platform and multi-channel 
releases whilst players all share  
the same server environment. 
•  All remaining work-for-hire projects 
were completed, as Tales from Deep 
Space with Amazon and Screamride 
with Microsoft were released.
•  The organisation was restructured  
for fully self-published operations  
by centralising development in the 
Group’s Cambridge headquarters  
and changing the staffing mix via 
targeted recruitment and redundancy  
at a cost of £0.3 million.
•  The Group started the development  
of its second self-published franchise, 
Planet Coaster, which was also  
publicly announced.

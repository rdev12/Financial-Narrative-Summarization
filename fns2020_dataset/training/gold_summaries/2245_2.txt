HIGHLIGHTS
“We have enjoyed an extremely successful year, with strong performances across the Group.
2011/12 has been a transformational year for the Group as we continue to see the benefit of our One 
Global Bloomsbury strategy . The acquisition of Continuum has significantly enhanced our academic 
business as we continue to focus on robust renewable revenue streams. This area will be a key driver of 
future growth. We have built a uniquely balanced business between trade and academic publishing.
There is also a fundamental shift happening from print to digital and from the high street to the 
internet. The decision to digitise our backlist several years ago continues to reap benefits and as a result 
we have seen significant ebook sales, up 159% year on year. 
The business has exciting opportunities for 2012 and beyond as our positioning, platform and industry 
insights coupled with our strong titles in the UK and US put us in a very healthy position for this dynamic 
market place. At a time when the traditional books industry is undergoing a revolution, we have built a 
robust and balanced business with more predictable income streams. Added to this, our highly innovative 
and entrepreneurial team, strong balance sheet and focused global strategy mean that we can continue to 
evolve and prosper in this market place.”
Nigel Newton Chief Executive

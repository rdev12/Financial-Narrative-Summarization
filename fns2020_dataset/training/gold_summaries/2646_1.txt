 Chief Executive’s Review
2008 has been a year of continued progress in tightening the focus 
in both of our businesses. In the Consulting business we have sought 
to improve the quality of our service delivery by narrowing our service 
offering to areas where we believe our knowledge provides us with 
a genuine competitive advantage. In the Software business we have 
continued the process of concentrating on our strategic products. We 
have sought to reduce our reliance on one-off bespoke projects and 
have continued investing significantly in getting our strategic products 
ready for market.
Financial Performance
Revenue
Group revenues for the year at £9.0m were down 7% on 2007. The 
Consulting business, in a difficult marketplace, achieved a 2% increase 
for the year on 2007. The Software business saw its revenues fall back 
by 38% on 2007 to £1.26m as a result of the Group’s decision not to 
actively pursue one-off bespoke solutions business. It is worth noting 
that the Software division’s 2007 revenues were significantly boosted by 
a large one-off bespoke project. Removing the impact of this project, we 
are encouraged to see that the underlying software business would have 
grown by 19% in 2008.
Contracted annuity revenues recognised during the year represented 
64% of Software revenue up from 25% in 2007, an increase of 
£290,000. Deferred income as at 31 December 2008 was £158,000 
down from £298,000 as at 31 December 2007.
Margin
Gross margin for the Group fell back 2% to 36% for the year principally 
due to the stronger sales performance from the traditionally lower 
margin Consulting division. The underlying margin in the Consulting 
business improved by 2 percentage points on 2007, as a result of the 
business focusing its service offer on higher margin engagements and 
high staff utilisation with rates approaching 90% for the year. The 
margin for the Software business reduced to 63% from 66%.
Operating expenses
Group operating expenses for the year continue to be largely personnel-
related, and have fallen by 20% on 2007. During the year £514,000 
of development costs were capitalised (2007: £552,000). The sale and 
implementation of our Integrity product saw us begin amortising our 
investment in Integrity and saw a charge in the year of £147,000 (2007: 
£nil). Removing the impact of development cost capitalisation and 
amortisation, operating expenses have fallen by £1,016,000. Reduced 
Directors’ emoluments and a lower charge for share-based payments 
account for £357,000 of this fall. The remainder of the reduction stems 
from our strategy of concentrating the Software business on building 
and selling our core strategic products allowing us to cut back on our 
solution delivery capability with average heads employed in the Software 
business in 2008 falling from 35 to 26.
Profit before tax
As a result of the tight cost controls outlined above, the Group recorded 
a profit before tax for the year of £36,000 compared to a loss before tax 
of £399,000 for 2007.
Intangible assets
The Group concentrated its development efforts in the first half of 
the year on completing and delivering its balance sheet substantiation 
product Integrity. The development focus in the second half of the year 
was on our remaining two strategic products: Agent Reconciliation 
and Control (Arc); and Operational Control Architecture (OCA). At the 
balance sheet date the carrying value of our investment in our strategic 
software products stood at £954,000 (2007: £587,000). 
Trade debtors
Trade debtor days outstanding have improved significantly, falling to 38 
from 61 in 2007.
Cash
The Group increased its cash by £16,000 leaving it unchanged at £2.8m. 
2007 saw an outflow of £906,000. There are two principal factors 
behind this improvement: operating cash before movements in working 
capital swung from an outflow of £206,000 to an inflow of £225,000 
and the improvement in debtor days produced an inflow of £741,000. 
We invested £514,000 (2007: £552,000) in building our strategic 
software products during the year. 
Dividend
The Directors do not recommend the payment of a final dividend for the 
year ended 31 December 2008 (2007: nil).
Consulting Division
The division had a successful year, achieving a growth of 2% in a difficult 
market. The year saw us manage a significant amount of client churn as 
a number of long-standing engagements came to an end. As a result, 
more than half of our revenue in 2008 came from new engagements, up 
from 35% for 2007. 
We have continued to focus our offering on the financial services sector. 
Our aim is to become the leading specialist provider of management 
consultancy services to the Capital Markets, Investment Management 
and Asset Servicing sectors. During the year we have defined and 
targeted our service offerings on the areas of Operational Risk & 
Control; Business Transformation; Client Servicing; and Strategic Cost 
Management. We have invested in recruiting and developing staff to 
ensure we have specific industry expertise and skills to deliver a quality 
service to our clients. The division’s business development capability 
was significantly enhanced during the year through investing in training 
existing personnel, recruiting those skills and developing our sales 
collateral to fit with our newly defined service offerings. 
Average headcount employed in the Consulting business remained 
unchanged on 2007 as we responded to market conditions by reining

Chief Executive’s Review
in our recruitment plans. However, the current market environment 
is creating churn at some of our competitors and we will continue 
selectively to recruit new consultants on an opportunistic basis where we 
feel we can add important new skills to our offering. We have worked 
hard at being more efficient in 2008 through defining our service 
offering and managing our resource pool. Utilisation rates have improved 
to close to 90% and the attrition rate has fallen. Both of these factors 
have contributed to an improvement of 2% in gross margin. 
Software Division
We are now firmly focused on our three strategic products: 
1. Integrity — provides senior management of our client organisations 
with transparency and enables greater control over the balance sheet 
substantiation process. It provides management with confidence that 
the assets and liabilities held on the Company’s balance sheet are 
accurately stated. 
2. Operational Control Architecture (OCA) — gives senior management 
visibility over their business processes, identifying and prioritising 
any risk areas. The product is currently operational in five leading 
banking Groups.
 3. Agent Reconciliation & Control (Arc) — the next generation of our 
existing product (Network Management) validates agent banks’ 
invoices against system generated expected fees and highlights any 
discrepancies for investigation.
This increased focus has enabled us to reduce the headcount engaged in 
our Software business from an average of 35 to 26 and has contributed 
to the removal of £700,000 of cost from the division. Our Software 
revenues have fallen back as a direct consequence of our decision 
not to actively pursue our bespoke solutions business and were down 
38% on 2007. We have, however, made progress in transitioning the 
business into an annuity revenue model with more than half of 2009’s 
target contracted as at 31 December 2008. Recurring revenues at 64% 
of Software revenue for the year, up from 25% in 2007, grew 57% on 
2007. Our strategy remains to build the quality of our future revenue 
stream through selling our new products on an annuity basis.
We have continued to invest in our strategic products with £514,000 
of internal labour development costs being capitalised during the year. 
Integrity was completed and installed in the year at our reference 
client, Deutsche Bank, and has now been deployed globally. Our 
development resource is now working on our next version of Arc
and on updating OCA.
Our sales and marketing efforts in 2008 were hampered by the delayed 
launch of Integrity and the deepening financial crisis in the final quarter. 
However, we have significantly expanded our sales reach during the year 
with two distribution agreements being signed. In April we entered into 
a partnership agreement with US-based Enterprise Solution Providers 
Inc (ESP) to market and sell Integrity to financial services firms in the US. 
Progress has been slow here and the turmoil in the financial markets has 
prevented us from making any real headway. In December we entered 
into a distribution agreement with Nimbus Partners Limited for OCA. 
Nimbus markets a complementary product which, when combined with 
OCA, should create a compelling proposition. Nimbus, through its sales 
force, gives us significantly more sales reach which also extends to 
other industry sectors. We are greatly encouraged by the progress 
made to date.
The financial crisis has brought the need for increased operational 
risk management into even greater focus. The need for effective risk 
management solutions underpinned by monitoring and control processes 
is now widely accepted with operational control now no longer simply 
limited to ensuring banks’ capital ratios are in line with Basel II. There is 
now recognition of the need for increased visibility and timely reporting 
to facilitate enhanced performance monitoring. Both OCA and Integrity 
address these needs and we are seeing increasing levels of interest in our 
products. 
Employees
Group average headcount employed during the year fell by 12 to 98, 
of which 81 were permanent employees, down from 93 in 2007. The 
decrease in headcount can be attributed to the rationalisation of the 
Software business and increased efficiencies within central corporate 
costs. 
Strategy
Despite the current turbulence in our end markets, we remain 
committed to the course that we have set the business on and believe 
that this is the right strategy to deliver long-term shareholder value. We 
continue to concentrate on delivering a focused, high quality proposition 
to our customer base and on tightly managing our cost base in order 
that we can present a strong and predictable business proposition to our 
shareholders and customers.
The Consulting division is increasingly robust with revenues in 2008 now 
more evenly distributed across a number of engagements. The Software 
division’s goal remains building and establishing Integrity, OCA and Arc 
as industry leading products. 2009 has already seen an increased level of 
activity on the sales and marketing front as we seek to capitalise on the 
renewed interest in the areas of operational risk and control. 
Current Trading and Outlook 
The performance of the Consulting division in the year to date is in 
line with its performance for the same period in 2008. However, due 
to the nature of our assignments, visibility in this division is limited 
and historically, to no more than three months. We are therefore 
concentrating our efforts on building our sales pipeline in what 
continues to be an extremely challenging market.
In the Software division we start the year with more than half of our 
budgeted revenue for the year already contracted. Whilst the increased 
interest in the area of operational control and risk is encouraging, we 
remain targeted on a shrinking financial services sector where many of 
our potential customers are operating under strict budgetary constraints. 
We expect market conditions to remain challenging throughout 2009. 
However, our healthy cash position, our agility, the strength of our client 
relationships and our lean cost base give us confidence that we are well 
positioned to emerge from 2009 in a healthy state.

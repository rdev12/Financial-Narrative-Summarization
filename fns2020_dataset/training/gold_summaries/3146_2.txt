(1) See total revenue which is analysed in Note 5 of the Financial Statements.
(2) EBITDA and Cash Operating Costs are non-GAAP ﬁnancial performance measures with no standard meaning under International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation IFRS. For further information and a detailed 
reconciliation, please see page 39 of this report.
(3) Results now reﬂect adoption of IFRIC 20 (restatement of 2011) and an exceptional provision against prepayments recorded in Q4 to reﬂect the 
removal of fuel subsidies which occurred in January 2012, refer to Notes 3 and 6 respectively of the Financial Statements for further details.  
The provision had no impact on the 2011 results.
(4) The Group has no non-current ﬁnancial liabilities in 2012 and 2011.
Revenues from gold and silver sales amounted to 
US$426.1 million, a 25% increase on $340.5 million  
in 2011. This was mainly driven by a 19% increase in 
the volume of gold sold as well as higher realised prices. 
Proﬁt before tax of US$198.6 million was 2% higher 
compared to 2011, driven by the increase in revenue 
offset by the inclusion of an exceptional provision against 
prepayments recorded in Q4 to reﬂect the removal of 
fuel subsidies which occurred in January 2012. Similarly, 
Earnings Per Share (EPS) increased against 2011 to 
US18.27 cents.
EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation 
and amortisation), excluding fuel subsidies, of US$233.3 
million reﬂected a 10% increase year-on-year from 
US$211.3 million in 2011, reﬂecting the strength of 
operations. The Sukari operation’s strong cash generation 
was also reﬂected in a 44% increase in “net cash 
generated by operations” of US$220.5 million. 
Cash and equivalents decreased by 10% to 
US$147.1 million due to an increase in acquisition of 
property, plant and equipment; mainly a result of the 
Stage 4 expansion.
The cash operating cost of production was US$669 per 
ounce, versus US$556 per ounce in 2011. The increase 
is due to the inclusion of an exceptional provision 
recorded in Q4 to reﬂect the removal of fuel subsidies 
which occurred in January 2012 which, if included, 
bring the like-for-like cash operating cost of production 
to US$530 per ounce, highlighting the success of the 
cost monitoring controls at Sukari. 
EPS serves as an indicator of proﬁtability, being used 
in determining the share price and value of companies, 
and are calculated as the net proﬁt divided by the 
weighted average of the number of Ordinary Shares 
issued. Both EBITDA and Cash Costs are non-IFRS 
ﬁnancial performance measures with no standard 
meaning under IFRS. Management uses these measures 
internally to better assess performance trends. EBITDA 
is the net proﬁt or loss for the period excluding income 
tax cost, ﬁnance cost, ﬁnance income and depreciation 
and amortization and is a gauge of the Group’s ability 
to generate operating cash ﬂow to fund its working 
capital needs and capital expenditures. The cash cost 
of production is calculated by dividing the aggregate 
of production cash costs by attributed gold ounces 
produced. For further information and a detailed 
reconciliation, please see page 39 of this report.

 > As expected, revenue at constant currency in the second half of 2013 
was similar to the first half. o n a full-year basis, revenue was down 
4.9% on both a reported and constant currency basis compared 
with 2012.
 > g roup eBIt A margin for the second half of 2013 increased to 12.9%, 
a 90 basis points improvement compared with the 12.0% achieved 
in the first half; for the full-year the margin was 12.4% (2012: 12.0%).
 > Across the regions, n orth America, europe and Asia/r est of w orld, 
trading conditions in the second half of 2013 have remained similar  
to those experienced in the first half of the year, with revenue stable 
at constant currency. eBIt A margins improved across all three 
regions during the second half of the year.
 > g ood progress on the portfolio reshaping announced in the 
n ovember 2013 Interim Management Statement (IMS), with  
circa £20 million of revenue being exited for which the g roup 
incurred £12.9 million of non-cash write-offs, which are shown in the 
income statement as ‘specific adjusting items’ in a separate column.
 > o perating cash flow was good at £127.0 million (2012: £126.8 
million) and net debt was reduced to £186.5 million (2012: £192.8 
million), resulting in a year end net debt to eBIt DA ratio of 1.3 times 
(2012: 1.3 times).
 > proposed final dividend increased to 6.7 pence per share (2012:  
Final 6.4 pence per share), giving a full-year dividend of 10.5 pence 
(2012: 10.0 pence), a 5.0% increase.
 > t rading results from overseas operations are converted at the 
average exchange rates for the year. In the second half of 2013, 
sterling strengthened against many of the g roup’s key currencies 
(including the u S dollar, euro and yuan). If the year end closing 
exchange rates were applied to these reported results, then the 
reported 2013 revenue and eBIt A would have been £44.2 million 
and £6.8 million lower respectively.

 > t he key driver of the o ne Morgan organisational structure 
announced last year is to accelerate profitable growth by  
investing in core advanced materials technologies where the  
g roup has differentiation, global market leadership positions and 
sustainable competitive advantage. Some key highlights of this in  
the past year include:
 –  Increasing the g roup’s research and development (‘r &D’) spend 
both in absolute terms and as a percentage of revenue, meaning 
the g roup’s r &D spend is circa two and a half times greater than  
in 2006.
 –  t he announcement of a new g lobal Materials Centre of excellence 
for Structural Ceramics in Stourport, u K. t his will seek to emulate 
for the g roup’s technical ceramics applications the world-leading 
breakthroughs already made in its Superwool
®
 fibre range  
from the now well-established g lobal Centre of excellence  
in Bromborough, u K.
 –  A 23% year-on-year increase in capital expenditure in 2013 to  
circa 1.25 times depreciation, as the g roup invests for profitable 
growth in new greenfield facilities such as Dalian, China and  
in converting the g roup’s high-temperature fibre lines to be 
Superwool
®
 enabled. In 2014, the g roup will be making  
further investments in growth capex including a new greenfield 
Superwool
®
 plant in the Middle east. t his will enable the g roup  
to leverage the strong local demand in petrochemical and 
aluminium markets and, at the same time, access low-cost energy,  
which will make the facility one of the g roup’s lowest cost plants  
in the world. t otal gross capital expenditure in 2014 is expected  
to be circa £40 million.
 –  A significant increase in graduate recruitment to 26, providing  
a pipeline of engineers and commercial leaders of the future.  
t he g roup’s target for 2014 is to increase its intake to over  
30 graduates.

 > t he o ne Morgan model has also delivered benefits to the cost base 
through its simpler, leaner structure. t his combined with other 
operational initiatives undertaken in the latter part of 2012 has 
delivered the stated cost base improvements of £10 million in 2013 
with a further £3-4 million to come through in 2014 as the full-year 
benefits of actions taken during the course of 2013 are realised.
 > t he g roup has made significant progress reshaping its portfolio:
 –  Since the n ovember 2013 IMS announcement, the g roup  
has made good progress in exiting circa £20 million of revenue 
from businesses with low/breakeven margins and limited 
differentiation. o ther low-margin businesses accounting for  
an additional £30 million of annual revenue being targeted  
for divestment in 2014.
 –  t he g roup has also substantially enhanced the returns of 
businesses that are currently below the g roup’s target of mid-teen 
operating margins. In particular the margin of the largest of these 
business areas, electrical carbon, has been improved significantly in 
2013 from mid-single digits into double digits with further progress 
expected in 2014.
 –  t he g roup’s mid-teen margin businesses have also shown 
progress in 2013. o f particular note is the improvement in 
high-temperature insulating fibre margins which meant that in  
the second half of 2013 the t hermal Ceramics business delivered, 
for the first time, margins in excess of 15%.

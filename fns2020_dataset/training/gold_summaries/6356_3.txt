Dividend
The directors recommend a ﬁnal dividend of 1.39p per share, payable on 
4 April 2003, which, taken with the interim dividend of 0.72p per share 
paid on 30 September 2002, makes a total dividend of 2.11p per share 
in respect of the year ended 30 September 2002, an increase of 28% over 
the previous year.
Board changes
I reported last year that Nick Buckles had succeeded Roger Wiggs as Chief
Executive on 1 January 2002, with Roger remaining on the board as a 
non-executive director.
Chris Shirtcliffe retired from the board in May 2002. Chris joined Securicor in
1975 and had been Group Finance Director since 1986. He made an immense
contribution on the board, being held in great esteem by all who had dealings
with him. One of Chris’ most important contributions was to put in place
comprehensive ﬁnancial controls and systems which have proved invaluable 
for the group’s worldwide operations. 
Sir James Birrell retired in September 2002, after nine years on the board. Jim
was a distinguished and highly effective chairman of the Audit Committee from
its inception in 1993. He was also the senior independent director, chairman 
of the Nomination Committee and a member of the Remuneration Committee.

Professor Jim Norton retired from the board in December 2002, having been 
a director for the two years during which we made crucial decisions about 
our various communications businesses, none of which ultimately we decided
to retain. Jim’s expertise in radiocommunications and electronics was an
invaluable aid to our assessment of these businesses.
I thank each of them for all that they did for Securicor and wish them well
for the future.
Two new executive directors were appointed. In June 2002, Trevor Dighton
joined the board, succeeding Chris Shirtcliffe as Group Finance Director. 
Trevor joined Securicor in 1995, since when he has occupied a number of
senior ﬁnance roles. Irene Cowden was appointed to the board as Group
Human Resources Director in August 2002. Irene joined Securicor in 1977 
and has wide experience in all aspects of HR management.
Staff tributes
I once again pay tribute to the commitment and loyalty of Securicor staff
throughout the world. Although they are often confronted by criminal and
other anti-social behaviour, they carry out their tasks with fortitude and pride
and are a great credit to the group. I thank all of them for their contribution
towards the wellbeing of Securicor and commend in particular those who 
have received bravery awards, both in the United Kingdom and overseas.
Future prospects
Over the last year we have experienced a continuing and dramatic fall in global
stock markets, reﬂecting growing economic uncertainty compounded by the threat
of war. We have also seen the collapse, on what is probably an unprecedented
scale, of some major corporations in North America, UK and Europe. 
Securicor was affected earlier in the year by the loss of Argenbright’s aviation
screening business in the United States, this function having been taken over
nationally by the federal authorities in the wake of the September 2001
terrorist attacks.
During the year under review we have enjoyed strong trading and produced
good results in our core ongoing security businesses and we are looking forward
to further growth, both organically and through complementary acquisitions.
Sir Neil Macfarlane

Arrow Global Group PLC � Annual Report & Accounts 2015 07
Measured growth that pays dividends 
2015 saw us celebrate our 10th anniversary 
and another year of strong results.  
The Group remains focused on pursuing  
a programme of both organic and 
acquisitive growth in a controlled and 
deliberate manner. 
We are confident that the foundations  
laid during the year will see us continue to 
prosper, and aligned to our on going success, 
have proposed a final dividend of 5.4p, 
bringing the full-year dividend to 7.1p, an 
increase of 39.4% on 2014. 
With our acquisitions in Portugal and our 
continued growth in the UK, we were able  
to welcome more than 250 new colleagues 
to the Group, and I would like to thank 
them and all our colleagues for a strong 
year which yielded record results. 
Changes to the board as the  
business grows
During the year, we re-shaped our board  
of directors to ensure that it was well-
equipped to continue to guide the business 
as it grows, diversifies and delivers on its 
proven strategy. 
In March, Lan Tu was appointed as a 
non-executive director and also to the audit 
and risk and nomination committees. She 
brings a wealth of experience to the business 
in European financial services, data, digital 
and technology arenas. 
In April, we announced changes in the 
responsibilities of Arrow Global founder, 
Zachary Lewy, who stepped down from the 
board to allow him to focus on leading  
the expanded origination team, and on his 
board positions with our recently acquired 
European subsidiaries and interests. 
At our annual general meeting in June,  
Sir George Mathewson retired from  
the board. As Chairman of Arrow Global  
from 2009 to 2013, Sir George guided  
the Company through its successful IPO  
in October 2013, and then became our  
Senior Independent Director. He made  
a significant contribution to the success  
of the Company and left with the gratitude  
of the entire board.
We were delighted to announce on  
3 March 2016 the appointment of Maria Luís 
Albuquerque as non-executive director 
with effect from 7 March 2016. As a serving 
member of the Portuguese Parliament who 
has held senior finance and treasury positions 
in the Portuguese public sector, she brings  
a wealth of international and financial sector 
experience and will complement the existing 
experience of the board.
Full authorisation. Fair and  
balanced reporting
During 2015 we submitted our Financial 
Conduct Authority (FCA) authorisation 
applications and look forward to receiving 
confirmation of authorisation later in 2016. 
We continue to engage with our regulator 
and welcome the significant changes that  
it has helped bring to the industry as a whole.
Having reviewed the information in this 
report, my fellow directors and I confirm that 
the annual report and accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable, 
and provides the information necessary  
for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model 
and strategy.
Chairman’s statement
We increased our expertise and holdings in areas of strategic focus such as secured loans, 
became the clear market leader in Portugal, as well as significantly increasing our portfolio 
holdings in the Netherlands. In the UK, we retained our position as a market leader and 
added a number of new clients to our franchise.
As we realised the benefits of the Capquest acquisition, and started to realise the benefits 
of the Whitestar and Gesphone acquisitions, we increased our servicing revenues and 
further diversified the business' income streams – a trend we expect to continue into  
2016 and beyond.

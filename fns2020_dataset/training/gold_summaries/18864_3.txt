Strategic Report
Chairman’s Statement
This was an excellent year for  
JUST EAT with revenues up 58% to  
£247 .6 million and Underlying  
EBITDA up 83% to £59 .7 million.
Dr John Hughes, CBE, Hon DSc 
Chairman
These results again demonstrate 
the strength of the business model, 
our ability to deliver incremental 
Underlying EBITDA while still 
investing for growth and the 
continued opportunities we see in  
the markets in which we operate.
In our first full year since IPO, this model, and the strategy 
it serves, has not changed. We continue to create value 
for shareholders by meeting the needs of restaurants and 
requirements of consumers, in a marketplace that continues 
to grow. We have enhanced our market-leading positions 
both organically and through ten targeted transactions 
over the year. 
Our financial performance was driven by a 65% increase 
in Active Users and a 57% increase in order volumes, led 
by a continued shift toward mobile transactions, which 
accounted for 66% of Group orders. Our mobile-led strategy 
is also benefitting our restaurant partners with the launch 
during the year of our partner centre App, a dedicated 
business management tool delivered to their mobile device.
Strong governance 
As JUST EAT matures as a listed company, more of the 
values and principles that guide us are codified and 
publicly laid out. This process is central to the Company’s 
determination to do the right thing by ensuring we meet 
or exceed the expectations of our employees, partners 
and stakeholders, in governance as well as in other areas. 
During 2015, we reviewed a number of policies and codes 
to ensure they provide a positive and productive working 
environment, rolled out an enhanced Employee Code 
of Conduct and publicly disclosed our carbon footprint 
for the first time. The Board will continue to develop the 
Company’s broader environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) arrangements, explained more fully on pages 34 to 
65 of this Annual Report.
With respect to Board composition, we saw Henri Moissinac 
step down on 31 July 2015, and I would like to thank Henri 
for his invaluable contribution and service to the Company. 
Diego Oliva was appointed an Independent Non-executive 
Director and a member of the Company’s Audit, Nomination 
and Remuneration Committees on 24 September 2015, 
Mr Oliva’s extensive international experience in technology, 
digital marketing and mobile sectors will be a great asset 
to JUST EAT.

Strategic Report
As discussed in the Company’s 
prospectus from the IPO, two 
financial sponsor shareholder 
appointed directors, Benjamin Holmes 
and Michael Risman, are planning 
to step down from the Board between 
announcement of the Company’s 
annual results and its 2016 Annual 
General Meeting (“AGM”), and will not 
present themselves for reappointment 
at the AGM. On behalf of the Board, 
I would like to offer my warmest 
thanks to both Ben and Michael 
for their sound advice and major 
contributions to the Company over 
the period of their involvement. As a 
result of these proposed changes, the 
number of Board members will reduce, 
although a search is underway to add 
a further Independent Non-executive 
Director, to bring the Board to full 
compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code in every regard.
An outstanding team 
JUST EAT’s Executive management 
team was further strengthened this 
year in line with our ambitions to 
bring in the additional capabilities 
we need to take full advantage of 
the opportunities ahead of us. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like 
to thank all of the JUST EAT team 
for their hard work and contribution 
to our continued success under 
David’s leadership.
Looking ahead
JUST EAT has much opportunity to 
continue growing: by finding and 
creating opportunities to maximise 
the benefits for our consumers, 
restaurant partners and employees, 
and in the process to create further 
shareholder value. 
We have continued to improve our 
market share, most recently through 
the strategic acquisition of four 
businesses announced in February 
2016. These acquisitions are consistent 
with our strategy to build and reinforce 
leadership positions in markets of 
scale. Nonetheless, the majority of the 
markets that we operate in remain 
underpenetrated, offering significant 
opportunity to continue shifting 
consumers to ordering online and 
especially via our Apps. The strength 
of our brands and technology, along 
with our ability to innovate, will drive 
our prospects in our core marketplace 
as well as opening adjacent markets, 
where we see additional opportunity 
for incremental revenues and profit.

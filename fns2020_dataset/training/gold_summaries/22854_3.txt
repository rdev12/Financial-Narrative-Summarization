I am pleased to present the 
inaugural set of Financial 
Statements for Debts.co.uk plc 
as an AIM listed company for the 
period ended 31 July 2006.
On its admission to the AIM 
market on 24 May 2006, the 
Board set out its objectives of 
investing in the future marketing 
to indebted individuals, building 
our infrastructure to provide 
a platform for the anticipated 
growth in the IVA and debt 
solutions market place and to 
ensure the current high quality of 
advice from our debt counsellors 
is maintained and developed 
ahead of any potential regulatory 
changes.  The Board also stated 
that where complimentary 
opportunities were identifi ed we 
would consider growth through 
acquisition.  
I am pleased to announce that 
the funds raised have enabled 
the Group to achieve a number of 
these objectives and additionally, 
we are well advanced in meeting 
all of these future goals in the 
near future.
Through the successful 
delivery of a range of services 
to fi nancially over committed 
individuals and the development 
of our team of debt counsellors 
who are specifi cally trained to 
provide impartial advice to our 
customers we have continued to 
see signifi cant growth of all our 
services.
Additionally, we continually 
look to improve our systems 
and controls where necessary 
to ensure that we meet all 
current and future regulatory 
requirements. Much of these 
developments are overseen 
by our team of insolvency 
practitioners who are themselves 
the subject of tight regulatory 
controls.
The Group will continue to work 
with other debt management 
companies to provide a collective 
response to calls for increased 
regulation and is part of the newly 
formed Debt Forum. The Board 
welcome these changes and 
believe the Group is well placed 
to be at the forefront of all future 
developments.
Through the acquisition of 
Neville Eckley & Co, the Group 
has extended its client base into 
new services including individual 
bankruptcies, company voluntary 
arrangements and corporate 
insolvencies. 
By continuing to focus on these 
objectives the Board believes the 
future prospects for the business 
to be extremely positive.

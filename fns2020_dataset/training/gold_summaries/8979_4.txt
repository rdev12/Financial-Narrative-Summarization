 Our core business is the production and sale of copper and we operate
a fully integrated process from mining ore through to the production of
ﬁnished copper metal. Kazakhmys is the 10th largest producer of copper
in the world. The production and sale of ﬁnished copper represents
around 70% of the Group’s mining revenue.
We also own a 26% stake in the mining company ENRC, worth $4.9 billion
as at 31 December 2009.

KAZAKHMYS AT A GLANCE
PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS
Kazakhmys Copper has 15 operating mines and 10 concentrators
which are spread across four regional units, Zhezkazgan, Balkhash,
Karaganda and East Region. The copper mines also produce
signiﬁcant quantities of silver, gold and zinc as by-products.
The grades of copper and mix of copper and by-products vary
signiﬁcantly from mine to mine.
The Group also has a Gold Division with two mines producing
gold with copper as a by-product.
There are copper smelters at Balkhash and Zhezkazgan, which
operate within a single smelting unit, receiving feed from the
concentrators and converting it to ﬁnished cathode. Kazakhmys
Copper has its own coal mines and power stations, which ensure
security and cost of power supply.
The gold by-product is sold in the form of bullion and silver in
the form of granules. These are produced at a precious metals
reﬁnery in Balkhash. Zinc is produced and sold as concentrate.
OUTPUT AND GROWTH PROJECTS
In 2009 the Group produced 320 kt of copper cathode from
32 MT of ore at an average grade of 1.18%. Output is likely to
remain steady over the next four years, as smaller mine extensions
offset declining grade and output at some of the more mature
mines, particularly in the Zhezkazgan Region. Production should
increase after that, as the Group has two substantial growth projects
and several medium-sized projects, which are equivalent to around
60% of current output.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY
Kazakhmys is one of the largest employers
in Kazakhstan with 60,000 employees and
Kazakhstan revenue represents 2.5% of
Kazakhstan GDP . The Group has a strong
commitment to corporate responsibility,
including investment in health and safety,

OUR KEY OPERATIONS
Kazakhstan is the 9th largest country in
the world, similar in size to Western Europe.
Along with copper, Kazakhstan is rich in
a wide variety of resources, including oil
and gas, chrome, iron ore, alumina, uranium,
zinc, gold and silver. The country has a strong
track record in attracting Foreign Direct
Investment, which since independence
amounts to over $103 billion. Kazakhstan
was the ﬁrst country in the former Soviet
Union to receive an investment-grade
credit rating.
The natural resources of Kazakhstan, and
its proximity to the major global markets
of China, Europe and Russia, give the
country signiﬁcant strategic opportunities.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOVERNANCE RESPONSIBILITY PERFORMANCE STRATEGIC REVIEW OVERVIEW
POWER
Kazakhmys is the largest power provider
in Kazakhstan, producing over 13%
of national output. Within Kazakhmys
Copper there are three power stations
providing power to the copper facilities.
There is a separate Power Division
containing the Ekibastuz GRES-1 coal-ﬁred
power plant. Since February 2010 Ekibastuz
GRES-1 has been jointly owned with
Samruk. Three power stations provide
power to the copper facilities.
Ekibastuz GRES-1 is the biggest power
station in Kazakhstan and one of the
largest coal power plants in the world.
Five out of eight blocks at Ekibastuz
GRES-1 are currently operational and
between them have annual capacity
of 2,500 MW. The plant is undergoing
a major refurbishment to return it to
its installed capacity of 4,000 MW.
This will require around $1 billion of
capital investment over the next seven
years. Ownership of Ekibastuz GRES-1
ensures power supply for all our future
growth projects.
Maikuben West is an open cast coal mine,
producing 3.7 MT in 2009. It supplies
about 25% of the required coal for
Ekibastuz GRES-1, as well as supplying
coal to external customers.
ENRC
The Group owns 26% of ENRC PLC,
which was worth $4,879 million on
31 December 2009. 14.6% of the
holding was purchased in October 2007,
before ENRC listed on the London Stock
Exchange. The rest of the holding was
acquired between July and October 2008.
The holding was bought at a total cost of
$3,834 million. The investment in ENRC
diversiﬁes the Group’s earnings and
provides strategic options.
ENRC is a mining company with its
principal operations in Kazakhstan and
is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Kazchrome division is one of the
largest producers of ferrochrome in
the world. The iron ore division produces
and sells iron ore concentrate and pellets,
and the aluminium division trades alumina
and produces aluminium.
OTHER OPERATIONS
MKM
MKM, based in Hettstedt, Germany,
produces reﬁned copper products
and manufactures and sells a variety
of pre-ﬁnished and semi-ﬁnished copper
and copper alloy products, including
wires, sheets, plate strips, tubes and bars.
These are sold primarily to customers
in the construction, automotive, aviation
and general engineering industries
through its worldwide sales team. MKM
purchases its copper from independent
traders. At the end of 2009, the decision
was made to sell the business.
PETROLEUM
Kazakhmys Petroleum consists of the
602km
2
Eastern Akzhar exploration
block, on the eastern fringe of the oil rich
Caspian depression. Eastern Akzhar is in
close proximity to the Loktibai-Kenkiyak
oil pipeline and the Kenkiyak-Atyrau
gas pipeline.
During 2009 analysis was made of the
seismic surveys and the ﬁrst two deep
wells were drilled. Further drilling and
analysis will be carried out in 2010.

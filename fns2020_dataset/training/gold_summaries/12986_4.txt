Creating value  
through our Brands
1 Community-gaming as outlined above refers to the different games and services available in our Mecca and Enracha venues. Unlike casinos the Mecca and Enracha 
customer base tend to have a shorter journey time to the venue and hence are more likely to reside in the local community. Also, the games on offer differ from those 
found in casinos; they are pari-mutuel and hence create a community-style game within the venue.

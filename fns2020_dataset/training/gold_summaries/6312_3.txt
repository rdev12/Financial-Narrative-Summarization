Chief Executive’s Review (continued)
It is a pleasure to write my inaugural Chairman’s Statement just a few weeks after joining Futura.
Firstly, I would like to convey my sincere thanks on behalf of everyone at Futura to Bill Potter, the 
Company’s former Chairman, and to acknowledge his pivotal role in the development of the Company. 
I am delighted that Bill’s scientific and technical expertise will continue to be available to Futura in his 
new role as Chief Scientific Officer.
I would also like to take this opportunity to outline why I was attracted to the Chairmanship of Futura 
and to give my assessment of the Company’s potential. 
I joined Futura after more than 35 years at GlaxoSmithKline, most recently as the President of its Consumer Healthcare division. 
My executive career has given me considerable experience of the consumer healthcare sector, which I believe is reliant on one 
thing: innovation.
Futura is a company with innovation at its core. It also has a great team of people, which it is a privilege for me to join. Its 
DermaSys
®
 delivery system is at the forefront of transdermal drug delivery, a delivery route that is particularly appealing for OTC 
products. DermaSys
®
 creates the opportunity for Futura to develop organically into a substantial business.
It is my intention to help Futura realise the full potential of its market opportunities whilst also using my experience of global 
companies to assist in its licensing strategy.
2012 promises to be a very exciting year for Futura with two products close to launch and a pipeline of further opportunities at 
various stages of development. I look forward to contributing to the Company’s success.

The Group ended the year with costs firmly under control, a more advanced and diverse development 
portfolio and the prospect of recurring royalty revenues.
International Financial Reporting Standards
The Financial Review should be read in conjunction with the Group financial statements and the Notes 
to the Group Financial Statements set out on pages 31 to 54.
The Annual Report and Accounts (“Annual Report”) for the Group is presented under International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the European Union. The financial statements of the Company are 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“UK GAAP”) and are set out on  
pages 55 to 58.
Revenue
Group revenue for the year ended 31 December 2011 was £158,055 (2010: £125,000).
Losses
The Group continues to maintain a focus on tight control of all expenditure.
The Group’s operating loss for the year ended 31 December 2011 was £2.10 million (2010: £1.34 million).
The Group’s loss after taxation for the year ended 31 December 2011 was £1.81 million (2010: £1.09 million).
Loss per share for the year ended 31 December 2011 was 2.53 pence (2010: 1.61 pence).
No dividends were paid and none are proposed by the Board of Directors (“the Board”) (2010: £nil).
Financial instruments
The financial instruments held by the Group are disclosed in note 12 of the Notes to the Group Financial Statements. The 
Group policy on exposure to financial risk is disclosed in note 2 of the Notes to the Group Financial Statements.
Group research and development costs
The Group aims to achieve cost effective research and development (“R&D”) and to bring products to market through licensing 
partners as soon as is practicable.
Group R&D costs each year reflect the number of products being developed, the stage of development reached for each and 
the impact on their progress of external factors.
R&D costs of £1,480,774 (2010: £760,637) were higher compared to 2010, due largely to an increase in early stage 
development evaluation following the completion of the fundraising in March. The 2011 figure also includes costs of £197,204 
in respect of the settlement of awards under the long-term incentive scheme (2010: £nil).

Group research and development costs (continued)
The table below shows the trend in our R&D costs and other administrative costs over the past five years ended 31 December:
2011

 R&D costs 1,480,774 760,637 810,188 1,390,616 1,508,269
 Other administrative costs 776,154 700,399 796,186 1,007,964 1,227,320
 Total operating costs 2,256,928 1,461,036 1,606,374 2,398,580 2,735,589
 R&D ratio 66% 52% 50% 58% 55%
The R&D ratio is the percentage of R&D costs relative to total operating costs. The Board monitors this ratio closely. Total R&D 
spend since the formation of the business in 1997 totals £12.24 million (55.8% of total cumulative operating costs). During 
the year, the sole subsidiary, Futura Medical Developments Limited continued to incur this R&D expenditure which has been 
accounted for as explained in accounting policy note 1.7 of the Notes to the Group Financial Statements and has been written 
off as incurred for all reporting periods prior to and including the year ended 31 December 2011.
The Board considers that this overall total R&D spend relative to its pipeline of later stage products and emerging new products 
distinguishes the Group’s lower funding requirements and risk profile from more typical businesses in the wider pharmaceutical 
industry. The Group’s strategy is to focus on medical devices and pharmaceutical drugs that offer the potential for a significant 
return on the costs of development. As well as progressing its existing R&D programme, the Group continues to seek new 
opportunities for potential products to add to its portfolio.
Other administrative costs
Other administrative costs for the year ended 31 December 2011 were £776,154 (2010: £700,399). These comprised all other 
operating costs excluding those relating to product development and associated intellectual property. The main constituents 
and their relative proportions were:
Year ended 
31 December
 2011
Year ended 
31 December
 2010
 Wages and salaries 67% 63%
 Legal and professional advisers 20% 22%
 Office costs and staff expenses 12% 13%
 Licensing negotiations 1% 2%
100% 100%
Supplier payment policy
The Group’s policy concerning the payment of its trade payables is to pay on the basis of the agreed terms of payment 
established with each supplier, providing that all terms and conditions have been complied with and are in accordance with the 
Group’s financial control procedures.
The average credit period for the Group (expressed as creditor days) during the year ended 31 December 2011 was 33 days 
(2010: 45 days). At the year end the Company had trade creditors totalling £19,513 (2010: £19,107) giving rise to an average 
credit period for the year ended 31 December 2011 of 54 days (2010: 90 days).

Charitable and political contributions
No political donations were made during either year. Charitable donations of £70 were made during the year (2010: £162).
Taxation
A tax credit of £259,704 (2010: £225,731) in respect of R&D expenditure incurred has been recognised in the Group financial 
statements. The increase compared to 2010 reflects a widening of the scope of qualifying indirect activities included in the level 
of R&D expenditure undertaken.
Capital structure and funding
The Group remains funded primarily by equity share capital. Equity funding (net of expenses) received since the formation of the 
business until 31 December 2011 totalled £20.48 million.
Cash held by the Group at 31 December 2011 totalled £2.58 million. This comprised cash and cash equivalents shown below

Principal activity
The principal activity of the Group is the research and development of pharmaceutical drugs and medical devices and their 
commercial exploitation. The Chief Executive’s Review on pages 4 to 8 and the Directors’ Report: Financial Review on pages 10 
to 12 set out in more detail the Group’s activities during the year and anticipated future developments.
Research and development activities
The main area of R&D continues to be in the field of innovative pharmaceutical drugs and medical devices for the consumer 
healthcare market with the focus being on sexual healthcare and pain relief management. In addition the Group is seeking to 
develop a product for the treatment of cellulite, an opportunity in the lifestyle category which has arisen as a result of further 
evaluation of our DermaSys
®
 technology.
Group strategy
The Group strategy is to focus on developing innovative products for the consumer healthcare market. This strategy responds 
to the well publicised demographic change of an ageing population, increasing prosperity, Government initiatives to increase 
self-medication, the natural desire for improved quality of life and the Directors’ expectations that consumer healthcare 
spending will increase as a result. The objective is to develop products such that each on its own has the potential to generate 
significant annual revenues in excess of our total Group annual operating costs.
The Group business strategy is centred on selecting and developing products based on five key criteria:
● ● Return on Investment: we focus on consumer healthcare products that offer the potential for a significant return on the 
costs of development.
● ● Product Profile: we focus on topically applied medicines, either stand-alone or in combination with a medical device. We 
only incorporate existing chemical entities into our products which gives our development activities a lower risk profile.
● ● Transdermal Delivery: our aim is to produce safe and effective products which are delivered through the skin.
● ● Strong Intellectual Property: the products are underpinned by our developing and retaining valuable intellectual property 
including: know-how, patents and trademarks, to protect their commercial position.
● ● Licensing: we aim to out-license our products during their development to established pharmaceutical and healthcare groups 
which offer the best potential commercial opportunities.
Our products CSD500 and MED2002 involve the application of the same chemical active compound, in each case in the sexual 
healthcare field. In pain relief our products TPR100 and TPR100-Rx also involve the application of the same chemical active 
compound. The development of our proprietary transdermal delivery technology, DermaSys
®
, has enabled the expansion of 
our product pipeline to include other new active compounds. PET500, RAD100 and, new in 2011, CRF100 represent the next 
applications of our DermaSys
®
 delivery technology to our product pipeline.
Long lead times for product development characterise the pharmaceutical industry. However, the Board seeks to drive the business 
through to revenue generation as soon as is practicable with due regard to regulatory standards and an appropriate commercial 
approach. This is achieved through swift decision-making, highly capable staff and the involvement of external expertise.
At the same time, the Board remains committed to keeping regular or fixed costs restricted to an appropriate level through the 
continued and judicious use of external consultants and professional advisers. Clearly, the lower the Group’s costs the earlier 
that revenue generation would lead to a key future financial milestone of monthly break-even and profitability.
Directors’ Report: Business Review
21233-04FUTURAME.indd   13 13/03/2012   09:32:12 14 FUTURA MEDICAL plc Annual Report 2011
21233.04 13/03/2012 Proof 7
The consumer healthcare market and competitive environment
The Group develops products that address the needs of the consumer healthcare market. The Group considers there to be two 
distinct categories in which it operates.
The first category is the global transdermal delivery market, valued at US$21.5 billion in 2010¹. Although the Group develops 
transdermal products for prescription, over the counter (“OTC”) and cosmetic use, its focus is on developing non-prescription 
drugs. These comprise the sexual healthcare products PET500 and MED2002 and the pain relief products TPR100, TPR100-
Rx (prescription only product) and RAD100 (may be a prescription only product). The global topical OTC analgesics market 
is valued at US$3.8 billion in 2010
2
 and the market leader for topical OTC analgesics has annual sales of US$374 million
3
. As 
PET500 and MED2002 could form new categories within the OTC market, no published data is available on the OTC sexual 
healthcare market to substantiate market size estimates. The prescription market for erectile dysfunction treatments was 
estimated to be in excess of US$4.2 billion
4
 in 2010.
The second category is the global consumer medical devices market. The Directors estimate that the market for consumer 
medical devices is worth between US$23 billion and US$26 billion. The consumer medical device being developed by the 
Group is the condom product CSD500, which fits within the US$4.2 billion global condom market
5
 and where our distribution 
partner RB, the makers of Durex
®
, are the global leader with 35% of the branded condom market
6
.
These consumer healthcare markets are dominated by global pharmaceutical and consumer healthcare groups with established 
distribution networks. Smaller R&D companies, such as Futura, seek to out-license their innovative products to these larger entities.
Futura offers its licensing partners its ability to identify commercially attractive consumer healthcare product opportunities 
coupled with a lower cost, expert and fast development model, backed by strong patent protection. In return for this, Futura 
seeks significant royalties from future sales of these products through its partners and their established distribution networks.
Key performance indicators
The Directors consider the successful achievement of development, licensing and commercialisation milestones and the 
number of products under development (beyond the evaluation stage) to be the major drivers of value creation for the Group. 
These are measures of the progress of the business towards its revenue generation goal and are considered by the Directors to 
be the key non-financial performance indicators used to determine achievement of Group strategy. The Group’s performance 
with regard to such milestones is discussed in the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 4 to 8.
The Directors consider Group cash and the absolute values of, and the ratio between, R&D costs and other administrative 
overhead costs as being the Group’s key financial performance indicators. The cost related indicators assist in monitoring 
financial control to reduce the hurdle to achieving a key future financial milestone of monthly break-even and profitability. The 
monitoring of cash gives due consideration to anticipated future spend required to prioritise development opportunities and to 
plan the resources required to achieve the goals of the business. The Directors’ Report: Financial Review on pages 10 to 12 
considers these financial performance indicators.

21233.04 13/03/2012 Proof 7
Principal risks and uncertainties
The development of pharmaceutical drugs and medical devices requires the necessary safety, stability and efficacy to be 
demonstrated in clinical programmes in order to meet the requirements of the appropriate regulatory bodies. These clinical 
programmes may not achieve their endpoints. The Directors consider that the key risks of the Group are:
Clinical development and regulatory risk
There can be no guarantee that any of the Group’s products will be able to obtain or maintain the necessary regulatory 
approvals in any or all of the territories in respect of which applications for such approvals are made. Where regulatory 
approvals are obtained, there can be no guarantee that the conditions attached to such approvals will not be considered too 
onerous by the Group or its distribution partners in order to be able to market its products effectively.
The Group seeks to reduce this risk by developing products using safe, well-characterised active compounds, by seeking 
advice from regulatory advisers, consultations with regulatory approval bodies and by working with experienced distribution 
partners.
Commercial risk
There can be no guarantee that the Group will succeed in establishing and maintaining the necessary contractual relationships 
with licensing partners for the Group’s products under development.
Even if the Group’s products are successfully developed and approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies, they may not be 
successfully launched by the Group’s licensing partners or enjoy commercial acceptance.
The Group seeks to reduce this risk by selecting experienced licensing partners, maintaining and developing its relationship with 
these partners and seeking the development of new products of interest to these partners.
Funding risk
The Group continues to incur substantial operating expenses. Until the Group generates positive net cash inflows from the 
successful development and commercialisation of its products it remains dependent upon additional funding through the 
injection of equity capital from share issues. The Group may not be able to generate positive net cash inflows in the future or to 
attract such additional required funding at all, or on suitable terms. In such circumstances the development programmes may 
be delayed or cancelled and business operations cut back.
The Group seeks to reduce this risk by keeping a tight control on expenditure, avoiding long-term supplier contracts (other 
than clinical trials), prioritising development spend on products closest to potential revenue generation, obtaining government 
grants (where applicable), maintaining a focused portfolio of products under development and keeping shareholders informed of 
progress.
As described in the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 4 to 8 and the Directors’ Report: Financial Review on pages 10 to 12 
the current economic environment is challenging and the Group has reported an operating loss for the year. Whilst measures 
have been implemented to preserve cash and secure additional funding, these circumstances create uncertainty over future 
availability of funding.
21233-04FUTURAME.indd   15 13/03/2012   09:32:12 16 FUTURA MEDICAL plc Annual Report 2011
21233.04 13/03/2012 Proof 7
Principal risks and uncertainties (continued)
As explained in the Chief Executive’s Review on page 5, equity funding of £0.50 million was obtained in 2011 following share 
option exercises and under the long-term incentive scheme. In addition equity funding of £3.20 million (£3.07 million net of 
expenses) was raised by way of a placing in March 2011.
As a result of this the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group and the Company has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For these reasons the Directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Treasury and financial risk
Treasury and financial risk management policy is concerned with financial instruments and management of interest rate risk and 
foreign exchange rate risk. Financial risks are quantified in note 2 of the Notes to the Group Financial Statements and were not 
considered significant at the Group Statement of Financial Position date.
Competition risk
The Group’s current and future potential competitors include, amongst others, major multinational pharmaceutical and 
healthcare companies with substantially greater resources than those of the Group. There can be no assurance that 
competitors will not succeed in developing systems and products that are more effective or economic than any of those 
developed by the Group, with its distribution partners, or which would render the Group’s products obsolete or otherwise non-
competitive.
The Group seeks to reduce this risk by securing patent registration protection for its products, maintaining confidentiality 
agreements regarding Group know-how and technology, monitoring technological developments and by selecting leading 
businesses in their respective fields as licensing partners capable of addressing significant competition, should it arise.
Intellectual property risk
The commercial success of the Group and its ability to compete effectively with other companies depend, amongst other 
things, on its ability to obtain and maintain patents sufficiently broad in scope to provide protection for the Group’s intellectual 
property rights against third parties and to exploit its pharmaceutical products. The absence of any such patents may have a 
material adverse effect on the Group’s ability to develop its business. The Group seeks to reduce this risk by only developing 
products where legal advice indicates patent protection would be available, seeking patent protection for the Group’s products, 
maintaining confidentiality agreements regarding Group know-how and technology and monitoring technological developments 
and the registration of patents by other parties.
The commercial success of the Group also depends upon not infringing patents granted, now or in the future, to third parties 
who may have filed applications or who have obtained, or may obtain, patents relating to business processes which might 
inhibit the Group’s ability to develop and exploit its own products.

Directors’ Report: Corporate Governance
Introduction
The Board is committed to maintaining appropriate standards of corporate governance. Although not mandatory for companies 
trading on AIM, the Group accepts the principles of good corporate governance as embodied in The UK Corporate 
Governance Code (“the Code”). A copy of the Code is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at 
www.frc.org.uk/corporate/ukcgcode.cfm.
There have been no material changes to our corporate governance processes and our compliance with the Code following our 
annual review.
Statement of compliance
The Board considers that given the size and nature of the Group’s activities it does not intend to comply with the Code in 
respect of the items listed below. This is considered by the Board to be reasonable and does not compromise the overall 
principles of corporate governance which the Board strongly supports:
● ● The Remuneration Committee, in deciding on remuneration at its annual review, evaluates the performance of the Group as 
a whole and that of the individual Directors. The precise nature of this performance evaluation is not specified in the Annual 
Report (Code B.6.1).
● ● Where the Board permits Executive Directors to serve in roles with other companies, as long as they do not compromise 
the individual’s ability to perform those services to the Group, the earnings from such roles need not be disclosed to the 
Board nor paid to the Group (Code D.1.2).
The Board considers that the remuneration of Executive Directors should include a performance related element which is 
almost entirely based on the award of share options or other share-based incentives as recommended by the Remuneration 
Committee and details are set out in the Directors’ Report: Remuneration Report on pages 23 to 27.
Board of Directors
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the Group.
From 1 February 2012 the Board comprises a Non-Executive Chairman (“Chairman”), a Chief Executive, two independent Non-
Executive Directors and two further Executive Directors. The Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors receive part of their 
remuneration in the form of shares but this does not constitute a material business relationship with the Group and is not considered 
to impair the independence of the two independent Non-Executive Directors. The Board is satisfied that it has an appropriate mix of 
experience in its Non-Executive Directors. The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are intended to remain separate.
John Clarke succeeded Bill Potter as Chairman of the Company. Bill Potter stepped down from the Board on 31 January 2012 
but will continue to play a key role as Futura’s Chief Scientific Officer and adviser to the Board. In November 2011 David Davies, 
Futura’s Product Development Director, became Chief Development Officer, reflecting the Company’s increasing emphasis on 
its product pipeline.
The Chairman provides strategic and operational guidance bringing to bear his extensive experience of the healthcare sector. 
He also oversees the duties performed by the Chief Executive and ensures that they are in line with Board expectations with a 
particular emphasis on monitoring product development. The Chief Executive manages the day-to-day running and strategic 
direction of the Company in line with policy decisions given by the Board and shareholder expectations with particular emphasis 
on the commercial direction of the Group.

Board of Directors (continued)
The Board retains full control of the Group with day-to-day operational control delegated by the Board to the Executive 
Directors. The full Board meets bi-monthly and on any other occasions it considers necessary. During 2011, there were 14 
Board meetings, three meetings of the Remuneration Committee, three meetings of the Audit Committee and three meetings of 
the Nominations Committee. All meetings were fully attended by their constituent Directors.
The Board is responsible for approving interim and annual financial statements, formulating and monitoring Group strategy, 
approving financial plans and reviewing performance, as well as complying with legal, regulatory and corporate governance 
matters. There is a schedule of matters reserved for the Board.
Biographies of the Board members are as follows.
John Clarke

Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises the Non-Executive Directors, Jonathan Freeman and Lisa Arnold, and is chaired by Jonathan 
Freeman as Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. It meets as required and specifically to review the Interim Report 
and Annual Report and to consider the suitability and monitor the effectiveness of the internal control processes. There were 
three Audit Committee meetings during 2011. The Audit Committee reviews the findings of the external auditors and reviews 
accounting policies and material accounting judgements.
The independence and effectiveness of the external auditor is reviewed annually and audit partners are rotated every five years. 
The possibility of undertaking an audit tender process is considered on a regular basis. The Audit Committee (with no Executive 
Director present) meets at least once per calendar year with the auditors to discuss their independence and objectivity, the 
Annual Report, any audit issues arising, internal control processes, appointment and fee levels and any other appropriate 
matters. As well as providing audit related services, the auditors also provide taxation advice. The fees in respect of audit and 
tax services are disclosed in Note 4 of the Notes to the Group Financial Statements. Fees for non-audit services paid to the 
auditors are not deemed to be of such significance to them as to impair their independence and therefore the Audit Committee 
considers that the objectivity and independence of the auditors is safeguarded.
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee are set out in the Investors/Governance section on the Group’s website at 
www.futuramedical.com.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. The system of internal control is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure of the achievement 
of business objectives and can only provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Audit Committee continues to monitor and review the effectiveness of the system of internal control and report to the Board 
when appropriate with recommendations.
The annual review of internal control and financial reporting procedures did not highlight any issues warranting the introduction 
of an internal audit function. It was concluded, given the current size and transparency of the operations of the Group, that an 
internal audit function was not required.
The main features of the internal control system are outlined below:
● ● A control environment exists through the close management of the business by the Executive Directors. The Group has a 
defined organisational structure with delineated approval limits. Controls are implemented and monitored by the Executive 
Directors.
● ● The Board has a schedule of matters expressly reserved for its consideration and this schedule includes acquisitions and 
disposals, major capital projects, treasury and risk management policies and approval of budgets.
● ● The Group utilises a detailed budgeting and forecasting system. Detailed budgets are prepared annually by the Executive 
Directors before submission to the Board for approval. Forecasts are updated at least quarterly to reflect changes in the 
business and are monitored by the Board including future cash flow projections. Actual results are monitored against 
annual budgets in detail on a six-monthly basis, with variances highlighted to the Board.

Internal control (continued)
● ● Financial risks are identified and evaluated for each major transaction for consideration by the Board and senior 
management.
● ● Standard financial control procedures are operated throughout the Group to ensure that the assets of the Group are 
safeguarded and that proper accounting records are maintained.
● ● A risk review process is in operation whereby the Chief Executive and Finance Director present a report to the Board each 
year on the key business risks.
Going concern
As disclosed in the Directors’ Report: Business Review on page 16 the Group financial statements have been prepared on the 
going concern basis as the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Directors’ qualifying third party indemnity provisions
The Group has made qualifying third party indemnity provisions in favour of the Directors against liability in respect of 
proceedings brought by third parties and these remain in force at the date of this Directors’ Report.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee comprised the two independent Non-Executive Directors and is chaired by Lisa Arnold. Bill 
Potter was invited to attend and acted as an adviser to the Nominations Committee because of his knowledge of the industry, 
however, by virtue of his executive role, he was not considered to be independent and was excluded from voting. John Clarke 
who succeeded Bill Potter as Chairman on 1 February 2012 has joined the Nominations Committee.
The Nominations Committee monitors the requirements of the Group in respect of Board composition as the Group evolves 
and with regard to succession planning. There were three meetings during 2011. The terms of reference of the Nominations 
Committee are set out in the Investors/Governance section on the Group’s website at www.futuramedical.com.
Employees
At 31 December 2011, the Group’s employees comprised: four Executive Directors and three full-time and one part-time 
member of staff, all of whom are employed by the subsidiary.
The Executive Directors keep staff informed of the progress and development of the Group regularly through formal and 
informal meetings and employee feedback is encouraged. The Group has a policy of offering share options or other share-
based incentives to all eligible employees with due consideration to the level of dilution to shareholders.
The Group does not discriminate between employees and prospective employees on the grounds of age, race, disability, 
religion or gender.
The Board recognises its obligation towards its employees to provide a safe and healthy working environment. The Group 
complies with health and safety legislation including conducting regular inspections and risk assessments.

Environmental, social and community matters
As a result of the size and nature of our operations, the impact of the Group’s operations on the local community and 
the environment is not considered to be significant. Recycling of office supplies is undertaken where possible. The Group 
operates in a highly regulated industry and clinical trials are conducted in compliance with regulatory requirements. The Group 
undertakes regular reviews of corporate social responsibility matters with policy updates and implements improvements to its 
operations where identified.
Relationship with shareholders
The Directors seek to build a mutual understanding of objectives between the Company and its shareholders. The Company 
reports formally to shareholders in its Interim Report and Annual Report setting out details of its activities. In addition, the Group 
keeps shareholders informed of events and progress through the issue of regulatory news in accordance with the AIM Rules 
for Companies (“AIM Rules”) of the London Stock Exchange. The Chief Executive and Finance Director meet with institutional 
shareholders following interim and final results. The Group also maintains investor relations pages and other information 
regarding the business, its products and activities on its website at www.futuramedical.com.
The Annual Report is made available to shareholders at least 20 working days before the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) 
along with notice of the AGM. Directors are required to attend the AGM, unless unable to do so for personal reasons or due to 
pressing commercial commitments, and shareholders are given the opportunity to vote on each separate resolution proposed 
at the AGM. The Company counts all proxy votes and will indicate the level of proxies lodged for each resolution, after it has first 
been dealt with by a show of hands.

Directors’ Report: Remuneration Report
Remuneration Committee: composition and terms of reference
The Remuneration Committee comprised the two independent Non-Executive Directors and is chaired by Jonathan Freeman. 
Bill Potter was invited to attend and acted as an adviser to the Remuneration Committee because of his knowledge of the 
industry. However, by virtue of his executive role, he was not considered to be independent and was excluded from voting. 
John Clarke who succeeded Bill Potter as Chairman on 1 February 2012 has joined the Remuneration Committee.
The purpose of the Remuneration Committee is to ensure that the Executive Directors and other employees are fairly rewarded 
for their individual contribution to the overall performance of the Group. The Committee considers and recommends to the 
Board the remuneration of the Executive Directors and is kept informed of the remuneration packages of senior staff and invited 
to comment on these. There were three Remuneration Committee meetings during 2011.
The Board retains responsibility for overall remuneration policy. The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are set 
out in the Governance pages of the Investors section on the Group’s website at www.futuramedical.com.
Policy on Executive Directors’ remuneration
Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract and retain executives of the necessary skill and calibre to run the 
Group. Direct benchmarking of remuneration is difficult given the specialised nature and size of the Group. The Remuneration 
Committee recommends to the Board remuneration packages by reference to individual performance and uses the knowledge 
and experience of the Committee members, published surveys relating to AIM companies, the pharmaceutical industry 
and market changes generally. The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for recommending any long-term incentive 
schemes.
The Board determines whether or not Executive Directors are permitted to serve in roles with other companies. Such 
permission is only granted where a role is on a strictly limited basis, where there are no conflicts of interest or competing 
activities and providing there is not an adverse impact on the commitments required to the Group. Earnings from such roles are 
not disclosed to the Group.
There are four main elements of the remuneration package for Executive Directors and staff:
(i) Basic salaries and benefits in kind
Basic salaries are recommended to the Board by the Remuneration Committee, taking into account the performance of the 
individual and the rates for similar positions in comparable companies. Benefits in kind comprising death in service cover and 
private medical insurance are available to all staff and Executive Directors. Benefits in kind are non-pensionable.
(ii) Share options and other share-based incentives
The Company operates approved and unapproved share option schemes for the Executive Directors and other employees to 
motivate those individuals through equity participation. Unapproved share options are occasionally granted to key consultants. 
Exercise of share options under the schemes is subject to specified exercise periods and compliance with the AIM Rules.
21233-04FUTURAME.indd   23 13/03/2012   09:32:21 24 FUTURA MEDICAL plc Annual Report 2011
21233.04 13/03/2012 Proof 7
Policy on Executive Directors’ remuneration (continued)
The schemes are overseen by the Remuneration Committee which recommends to the Board all grants of share options 
based on the Remuneration Committee’s assessment of personal performance and specifying the terms under which eligible 
individuals may be invited to participate.
The Code refers to the requirement for the performance related elements of remuneration to form a significant proportion 
of the total remuneration package of Executive Directors and should be designed to align their interests with those of the 
shareholders. In the development phase of the Group and during the early stages of revenue generation, the Remuneration 
Committee currently considers that the best alignment of these interests is through the continued use of incentives for 
performance through the award of share options or other share-based arrangements.
The Company operates a long-term incentive scheme (“LTIS”). The quantum of any awards receivable by the Executive 
Directors will depend on the Company achieving set milestones and the share price at the time relative to targets set in 
advance. As a guide, if all of the approved milestones are achieved at the share price targets over the next 48 months and if the 
Company exercised its discretion to settle the awards in equity then the additional shares issued in after tax settlement would 
be equivalent to approximately 3% of the issued share capital.
(iii) Bonus scheme
The Group has a discretionary bonus scheme for staff and Executive Directors.
(iv) Pension contributions
The Group pays a defined contribution to the pension scheme of Executive Directors and other employees. The individual 
pension schemes are private and their assets are held separately from those of the Group.
Salaries and benefits were reviewed in January 2012 to cover the period from 1 February 2012 to 31 December 2012. Future 
reviews will be undertaken on an annual basis for implementation from 1 January each year to enable the Group’s performance 
over the preceding financial year and the strategy for the forthcoming year to be considered.
Service contracts
The Executive Directors are employed under service contracts requiring six months’ notice by either party. Non-Executive 
Directors and the Chairman receive payments under appointment letters which are terminable by three months’ notice by either 
party. The service contracts of the Non-Executive Directors are made available for inspection at the AGM.
All Directors are also Directors of the subsidiary company, Futura Medical Developments Limited.
Directors’ Report: Remuneration Report (continued)

21233.04 13/03/2012 Proof 7
Policy on Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration
The Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman each receive a fee for their services as a director, which is approved by 
the Board, mindful of the time commitment and responsibilities of their roles and of current market rates for comparable 
organisations and appointments. Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman are reimbursed for travelling and other incidental 
expenses incurred on Group business.
The Board encourages the ownership of Futura shares by Executive and Non-Executive Directors alike and in normal 
circumstances does not expect Directors to undertake dealings of a short-term nature.
In a revision to the previous policy the three Non-Executive Directors will, from 2012 onward, receive a proportion of their 
remuneration in the form of shares. The quantum of shares will be determined at the start of each calendar year based on the 
average closing mid-price of the last ten trading days prior to the year end. For the 2012 award this has been determined as 
84.10 pence. The Non-Executive Directors will receive the shares at the end of the 2012 financial year.
The Board considers ownership of Futura shares by Non-Executive Directors as a positive alignment of their interest with 
shareholders. The Board will periodically review the shareholdings of the Non-Executive Directors and will seek guidance from 
its advisers if, at any time, it is concerned that the shareholding of any Non-Executive Director may, or could appear to, conflict 
with their duties as an independent Non-Executive Director of the Company.

Directors’ Report: Statement of Responsibilities
Adequacy of information supplied to auditors
Each Director has taken all reasonable steps to make themself aware of any information needed by the Group’s auditors for 
the purpose of their audit and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information. The Directors are not aware of any 
relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware.
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as 
adopted by the European Union and have elected to prepare the Company financial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (“UK GAAP”)). Under 
company law the Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and Company and of the total comprehensive profit or loss for the Group for that period. The 
Directors are also required to prepare the financial statements in accordance with the rules of the London Stock Exchange for 
companies trading securities on the Alternative Investment Market.
In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are required to:
● ● select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
● ● make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
● ● state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union,  
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
● ● prepare a Directors’ Report and Directors’ Remuneration Report which comply with the requirements of the 
Companies Act 2006.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and enable them to 
ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Group and the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
Website publication
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that the Annual Report and the financial statements are made available on a website. 
Financial statements are published on the Company’s website, www.futuramedical.com, in accordance with legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements, which may vary from legislation in other 
jurisdictions. The maintenance and integrity of the Company’s website is the responsibility of the Directors. The Directors’ 
responsibility also extends to the ongoing integrity of the financial statements contained therein.

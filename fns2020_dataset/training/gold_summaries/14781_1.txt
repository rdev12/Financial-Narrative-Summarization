 STADIUM GROUP PLC
Annual Report and Accounts 2006 6
Chief Executive’s review
Covering the year ended 31 December 2006
Overview
The business has reported
satisfactory results in view of the
underlying market conditions, and
enters 2007 with a positive outlook.
Financial results
Turnover increased 6% to £38.55m
(2005: £36.52m), with similar rates
of growth across both Electronics
and Plastics, and both in Asia and
the UK.
Operating profit reduced as
expected by 12% to £2.28m 
(2005: £2.60m). This was a
reflection of the more challenging
trading conditions prevailing for
much of the year, and especially 
the first half. In particular, material,
energy and operating costs
increased sharply, leading to
pressure on margins until their
effect could be fully reflected 
in selling prices. 
Notwithstanding these pressures,
reported profits would have been
virtually unchanged at constant rates
of exchange, the effect of which are
explained below. 
Profit before taxation decreased by
11% to £2.35m (2005: £2.64m), or
by 17% to £2.16m (2005: £2.60m)
before adjusting for exceptional
items and goodwill amortisation. The
exceptional gain related to the sale
of freehold property in Hong Kong
arising on the relocation of Stadium
Asia office premises amounting to
£0.34m (2005: sale of surplus UK
freehold property of £0.33m).
Reported earnings per share were
7 .0 pence, a decrease of 8% 
on last year (2005: 7 .6 pence). 
Earnings before exceptional gains
and goodwill amortisation were 
6.3 pence (2005: 7 .6 pence).
Effects of foreign currency
exchange rates
During the year the United States
dollar weakened against Sterling by
approximately 15% and ended the
year at the lowest level for many
years. The translation effect of these
movements reduced reported sales
by £1 .49m (4%), profit before taxation
by £0.14m (6%) and net assets by
£0.89m (11%) when compared with
the opening rate of exchange.
Furthermore, the Chinese Yuan has
appreciated by a further 5% during
the year against the United States
Dollar, adding approximately £0.2m
to operating costs in China.
Electronics
Sales overall grew by 6% to
£27 .96m and it was especially
satisfying to experience a return 
to growth in our UK operations.
Automotive volumes continued 
to decline as expected, although
significant new business has been
awarded that will enter production
during 2007 .
Our phased withdrawal from the
telecom market was completed
during the first half of the year,
without incurring significant exit
costs, and we do not anticipate
further activity in this sector. 
Strong growth was experienced in
consumer markets and there are
further substantial opportunities in
the pipeline.
Material prices, which increased
rapidly throughout the first half of
the year, were more stable in the
second half. Most major customers
have now accepted price increases
to reflect new economics, although
some marginal business was
sacrificed where such increases
could not be achieved.
Our goal remains to work with
substantial long term partners who
recognise the value of quality,
service and reliability when
executing sourcing decisions.
Whilst operating margin for the full
year reduced by 1.5% to 6.7%, the
performance in the second half
(7 .3%) marked a recovery from the
6.1% reported at the interim stage.
Stadium Power contributed more
than £3.3m of sales, including
£0.4m from the acquisition of 
KRP Power Source (UK) Ltd on 
30 August 2006. Growth was less
than expected as a result of
technology changes in the gaming
machine sector resulting in lower
demand for hardware. Development
of a range of industry standard
items for manufacture by Stadium
Asia and distribution through
Stadium Power and KRP will 
be completed during 2007 .

70011 PRE NEW  17/3/07  7:00 am  Page 6 Growth in sales was attributable to
new product launches and additional
market share won by Stadium
Building Products.
Profits were virtually unchanged; 
a commendable performance when
taking into account the substantial
increases in material and energy
costs incurred during the year.
Balance sheet and cash flow
Cash flow from operations
amounted to £0.85m, stated after
meeting pension deficit funding
contributions of £1.09m (2005: net
inflow of £0.60m after pension
contributions of £1.24m).
Net cash outflow on fixed assets 
of £1.00m included the relocation 
of the Hong Kong office of Stadium
Asia Limited at a net cost of £0.2m.
There was further investment in
manufacturing plant and equipment
in Asia and the UK totalling £0.80m,
slightly ahead of the corresponding
depreciation charge.
The acquisition of KRP Power
Source (UK) Limited was completed
on 30 August 2006 at a total 
cost of £0.57m. This additional
investment in the business was
funded by drawing down net bank
loans of £2.70m, and resulted in
year end borrowings of £4.38m
(2005: £2.06m).
Pensions
The market value of the pension
scheme assets increased by 11%
during the year to exceed £22m. 
The net pension liability, measured
on a basis consistent with that 
used in the prior year, would 
have reduced from £4.86m to
approximately £3.0m. The directors,
in consultation with the scheme
actuary, have recognised more
recent guidance on expected
mortality rates. The effect of this
new guidance has resulted in 
an 8% increase to the scheme
liabilities before deferred tax
amounting to £2.04m, and a net
pension liability of £4.45m.
Acquisitions
During the year we completed 
the acquisition of KRP Power 
Source (UK) Limited for net cash
consideration of £0.57m. Since
completion on 30 August 2006 
the business has performed 
slightly ahead of our expectations
contributing an operating profit
(before goodwill amortisation) 
of £0.06m.
Further acquisition activity, focused
particularly on businesses with
product design, marketing and
distribution capabilities, remains 
a priority. 
Outlook
Current trading is ahead of the
corresponding period last year 
and the immediate outlook 
is encouraging.
We anticipate growth in revenues
and a further recovery in margins 
in 2007 , although sustained dollar
weakness against both Sterling 
and the Chinese Yuan may offset
the full effect of this improvement 
in reported earnings.

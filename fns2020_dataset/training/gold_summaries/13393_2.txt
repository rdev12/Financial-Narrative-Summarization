The selected financial information set out below is derived from the
consolidated financial statements. The selected financial data should
be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes
(pages 75–128), as well as the OFR on pages 54–72.
Prior to 2005, the Group prepared its audited annual financial
statements under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (UK
GAAP). From 1 January 2005, the Group has been required to prepare
its annual consolidated financial statements in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and International
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) interpretations
as adopted by the European Union (EU) and those parts of the UK
Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements take account of the requirements and options
in IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting
Standards’ as those requirements relate to the 2004 comparatives
included in the financial statements.
IFRS differs in certain respects from accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States (US GAAP). The material differences
between IFRS and US GAAP relevant to the Group are explained 
on pages 129–133.
The consolidated financial statements of the Group included in this
annual report are presented in pounds sterling (£). On 31 December
2006, the Noon Buying Rate in New York City for cable transfers in
foreign currencies as announced for customs purposes by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York was $1.96 = £1; on 9 March 2007 the Noon
Buying Rate was $1.93 = £1. Additional information on exchange rates
between the pound sterling and the US dollar is provided, on page 149. Consolidated income statement data continued
for the year ended 31 December

Notes:
1 Each ADS (American Depositary Share) represents six ordinary shares.
2 Dividends declared for 2002 include UK tax credits. Dividends declared for 2003–2006 exclude UK tax credits. Amounts receivable could be higher for US shareholders who have elected to retain
benefits of the old US/UK tax treaty. For further information relating to dividends and the UK taxation of dividends see page 145.
3 The 2005 IFRS balance sheet has been restated to recognise irrevocable commitments to repurchase shares during close periods as a liability (see ‘Basis of accounting’ on page 78). The impact of
recognising these commitments is to increase current liabilities and to decrease shareholders’ equity in accordance with IFRS at 31 December 2005 by £59 million.

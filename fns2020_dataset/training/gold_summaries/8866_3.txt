 Johnson Service Group PLC  Annual Report 2007
02
2007 has been a very difficult year for the Group and during  
the latter part of the year we were focused on renegotiating 
terms with our banks and reviewing the future strategy. The  
main businesses continued to trade well in an increasingly  
difficult economic situation despite the Group’s debt position. 
On 11th April 2008 we announced the proposed disposal of the 
Corporatewear division, which was subsequently approved  
by Shareholders and completed on 28th April 2008 for a  
cash consideration of £82.5 million. At the same time, we 
announced the details of new bank facilities which provide 
funding for the Group to December 2010.  
The Group continues to focus on providing services to both 
individual consumers and businesses and has a strong market 
position in managed property services and market leading 
positions in textile rental and drycleaning. Our strategy is to 
maintain and develop these businesses.
 Group Results
Total continuing revenue for the year reduced to £406.1 million 
(2006: £410.9 million), while revenue, excluding costs recharged 
to customers, increased to £365.0 million (2006: £360.6 million). 
Continuing adjusted operating profit was lower at £30.1 million 
(2006: £34.9 million).
Adjusted operating profit throughout this statement refers 
to operating profit before amortisation and impairment of 
intangibles (excluding software amortisation) and exceptional 
items. Adjusted profit before tax refers to adjusted operating 
profit less finance costs, excluding exceptional finance costs  
in relation to bank fees. 
Amortisation and impairment of intangibles (excluding software 
amortisation) of £27.2 million (2006: £5.8 million) includes  
£21.1 million in respect of the impairment of goodwill. This  
largely comprised £13.2 million reflecting the disposals of  
the Corporatewear division in March and April 2008 and  
£6.5 million in respect of the Facilities Management division.
Net exceptional costs for the year of £41.0 million (2006:  
£5.4 million) included restructuring costs of £16.7 million  
(2006: £8.1 million), £3.6 million for the accelerated depreciation 
of linen stocks at Stalbridge and the write down of the ERP system 
of £16.7 million. The ERP system will continue to be utilised only 
within the Stalbridge business up to the end of 2008 and the net 
book value of the software and hardware has consequently been 
written down to reflect this restricted use. In addition, professional 
fees of £2.4 million were incurred in connection with the bank 
debt restructuring process, with further costs to be incurred  
in 2008.
Net finance costs in 2007 were £14.3 million comprising 
exceptional finance costs in relation to bank fees of £2.7 million 
and £11.6 million of other finance costs (2006: £9.2 million). 
The increase in other finance costs reflects higher average 
borrowings and interest rates during the period. Adjusted  
pre-tax profit on a continuing basis, excluding amortisation  
and impairment of intangibles (excluding software amortisation)  
and exceptional items and exceptional finance costs, was £18.5 
million (2006: £25.7 million).
After the exceptional costs and amortisation and impairment 
of intangibles (excluding software amortisation) noted above, 
the pre-tax loss was £52.4 million (2006: profit of £14.5 million). 
Adjusted fully diluted earnings per share from continuing 
operations were 19.7p (2006: 32.6p) while continuing earnings 
per share including exceptional items and amortisation and 
impairment of intangibles (excluding software amortisation)  
were a loss of 75.8p (2006: profit of 22.6p).
The results for the Corporatewear division, which has been 
disposed of subsequent to the year end, are included within  
the figures reported.
Chairman’s Statement

 Finances
Total net debt at the end of the year was £168.5 million 
(December 2006: £142.5 million) following an increase in  
working capital during the year of £11.1 million and the payment  
of the final 2006 dividend of £8.9 million. On completion of  
the Corporatewear disposal, £65.0 million is being repaid to the  
banks and our facilities reduced by a like amount.
A favourable movement in market assumptions together with 
additional cash contributions of £3.5 million during the period  
has further reduced the recorded net deficit after tax for all  
post retirement benefit obligations from £20.6 million at 
December 2006 to £10.8 million at December 2007. This will 
be assisted further by the contribution of £2.1 million from the 
Corporatewear disposal. 
 Dividend 
No dividend is being declared for 2007. 
 Board Changes
In December, we announced that John Talbot had been  
appointed as interim Chief Executive Officer and had joined  
the Board following the departure of Charles Skinner, who  
had joined as Chief Executive in April 2007. 
John has over 25 years of restructuring experience. He was 
formerly Global Head of Arthur Andersen’s Corporate Finance 
and Corporate Recovery practice until 1999 and is currently  
an Executive at Kroll Talbot Hughes Limited, a leading European 
turnaround and restructuring firm. The Board is confident that 
his experience will prove invaluable in the development and 
implementation of a recovery plan for the Group. During April  
a further arrangement has been entered into under which  
John will remain with the Group until at least the end of 
September 2008 and discussions are underway regarding  
a more permanent arrangement.
Yvonne Monaghan, previously the Group Financial Controller, 
joined the Board as Finance Director at the end of August 2007.
Simon Moate resigned from the Board in July 2007 and  
Jim Wilkinson resigned from his role as Finance Director in 
August 2007. 
 Admission to AIM
As explained in the Circular issued to Shareholders on 11th April 
2008, your Board is recommending that the Group’s Stock 
Exchange listing be transferred to AIM. The Board anticipates  
that recurring savings will be made by this proposed move,  
which will be voted on by Shareholders at an Extraordinary 
General Meeting on 8th May 2008.
 People and Culture
I would like to put on record my thanks for the considerable  
effort by all of our employees at every level during the recent 
difficult circumstances.
 Outlook
Our three continuing businesses have strong market positions 
and are an excellent base on which to build the Group’s 
rehabilitation as a leading services company. The disposal of 
the Corporatewear division and the resultant reduction in debt, 
together with the agreement of medium term bank facilities, 
mark an important initial step in restoring financial stability.  
The terms of the banking facilities incentivise the raising of  
equity and the Board will be considering this in consultation  
with Shareholders.  
Our aim is to create a sound financial structure which will  
enable Shareholders to benefit from our market leading  
portfolio of businesses.

Chief Executive’ s Review
The Group has delivered a good 
operational performance and enjoyed the 
benefit of a rising gold price. These factors 
combined increased profit before tax by 
42.6% to £9.7m (2015: £6.8m).
Our store estate of 181 stores comprises 126 H&T Pawnbrokers stores,  
24 Est1897 second-hand jewellery retail stores, and 31 of our new H&T 
Money brand stores. During the year we have closed eight underperforming 
stores and expect a small number to close in 2017.
The Group has delivered significant growth in gross profits from the 
Personal Loans, FX and Buyback products which collectively increased  
by 59.2% to £7.8m (2015: £4.9m). Despite store closures, gross profits 
from Pawnbroking were flat and Retail was 8.7% up on 2015. The higher  
gold price has resulted in increased profits of £6.0m (2015: £2.4m) from 
Gold Purchasing and Pawnbroking Scrap activities.
The Group has improved the effectiveness of the online channel delivering 
133.3% growth in the online Personal Loans with 68.4% of online 
applications coming through mobile devices. We intend to develop this 
further during 2017 having established a range of brokers who introduce 
applications to us.
THE MARKET
The number of high street outlets of our main competitors has reduced  
by approximately 40% since December 2013, but by only 5% since 
December 2015 as the industry adjusts to the new trading environment. 
The favourable gold price in 2016 has helped most operators, including 
H&T, and there have been no further regulatory restrictions on high-cost 
short-term credit.
The demand for short-term small-sum loans remains strong and  
we believe the Group has developed the right products and capabilities  
to take advantage of market conditions.
OUR STRATEGY
The Group’s strategy is to serve a customer base whose access to 
mainstream credit is limited and for whom small-sum loans can help  
to address short-term financial challenges. The Group will continue  
to deliver this strategy by developing a range of lending products,  
both secured and unsecured, offered in store and online.
The development of a suite of services including Retail, Buyback and FX, 
improves returns and reduces the Group’s exposure to gold price volatility.
We continue to innovate and explore how to interact most effectively with 
our customers through the development of introducer channels, our online 
capability and our brand.
REGULATION
THE FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY
The regulation of Consumer Credit moved from the Office of Fair Trading 
(OFT) to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on 1 April 2014.  
The Group obtained authorisation from the FCA on 11 February 2016 and 
we welcome the higher standards that this change will bring to our sector.
HIGH-COST SHORT-TERM COST CAP
On 1 January 2015, the FCA implemented its cap on the interest rate  
and charges that apply to High-Cost Short-Term Credit (HCSTC). The FCA 
has stated that it will review the price cap during the first half of 2017. 
We have designed our Personal Loans so that all are below the current cap; 
in reality, the vast majority are significantly lower than the cap. We therefore 
believe that this review will have a limited impact on our product.
REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
The Group’s total gross profits increased 15.4% to £54.8m (2015: £47.5m) 
principally as a result of the increase in gold price assisting Pawnbroking 
Scrap and Gold Purchasing and strong growth in the Personal Loans and 
Other Services segments.
PAWNBROKING
Gross profits from pawnbroking were stable at £28.4m (2015: £28.4m) 
while the gross pledge book increased to £41.3m (2015: £39.0m).  
The reduction in yield was the result of a changing business mix to larger 
loans at a lower interest rate. This shift was expected as the business 
explores the new “Concession” format to access a new customer base. 
Notwithstanding the increase in gold values, high street pawnbroking 
continues to be a challenging market due to lasting competition and 
reduced gold in circulation. The Group closed eight locations during the 
year resulting in the loss of £0.1m in pledge book from two of those units 
through sale to local operators. In addition, the Group acquired £0.1m  
in pledge book from four competitor locations, relocating the customers  
to our stores.
The Group continues to invest in expanding the expertise and service  
in this critical segment through development of the business in  
Bond Street (London) and more importantly the recruitment of a small 
team of highly skilled individuals to support the wider business through  
the Expert Eye system. 
The Board believes that while there is still opportunity in Pawnbroking for 
H&T the market is shrinking and in order to maintain our position we must 
develop new channels for customer acquisition particularly through brokers 
and online.

RETAIL
Retail sales grew by 3.4% to £30.5m (2015: £29.5m) and gross profits 
8.7% to £11.2m (2015: £10.3m). 
The Group had two focus areas for the year: improve margins and  
improve inventory management. Progress has been made on both  
of these objectives, particularly in H2 2016. During 2016 the store 
inventory increased by £5.0m as we completed the implementation  
of the planograms across the store estate.
We are encouraged by the performance in H2 2016 relative to H2 2015 
where we have seen an increase in inventory, gross profits and margins. 
The Group acknowledges the pressure on consumer spending post-Brexit 
and the challenges presented by the expected increase in inflation.  
We believe that the value presented by our second-hand offering positions 
us well among other retailers of luxury goods, while shifting behaviours  
(as customers seek the best deal) could provide opportunities for H&T.
PERSONAL LOANS
Revenue from Personal Loans increased 45.8% to £3.5m (2015: £2.4m) 
with the year-end net loan book up 123.8% to £9.4m (2015: £4.2m).
The Group believes that Personal Loans is an important opportunity, 
allowing us to expand our customer base in store, online and through 
broker channels. Over the past three years we have developed our 
understanding, systems and infrastructure to deliver what we believe are 
the most suitable products for our customer base, efficiently delivered 
using the strengths of our store network and staff. The increase in the 
monthly average loan book of 80.6% has resulted in an increase  
in revenues of 45.8%. This is in line with management expectations,  
both for credit quality and performance. 
During 2016, we have also increased the online loan book by 133.3%  
to £0.7m (2015: £0.3m), implemented a store-based broker product 
through Cash Converters stores, and launched our larger loan at lower 
interest rates. We continue to develop our platforms to serve a changing 
market; in Q4 2015 53.3% of our loan applications originated from  
a mobile device. This increased to 68.4% in Q4 2016.
Operationally we have relocated our call centre operations to a new 
purpose-built location and implemented new dialler and customer 
relationship management systems. The developments to date have been 
successful and provide a strong foundation for our expansion into this 
exciting market.
The FCA has announced its review into the high-cost short-term credit 
(HCSTC) cost cap in 2017. Approximately 80% of the loans issued fell 
under the definition of HCSTC in 2016; none of our loans were at the 
interest cap. The H&T personal loan is significantly cheaper than loans 
offered by our competitors to this market and, while the outcome of the 
review is unknown, we do not anticipate that it will have a significant 
impact on our product.

PAWNBROKING SCRAP
Gross profits from Pawnbroking Scrap increased to £2.1m (2015: £0.1m) 
principally due to the increase in the sterling gold price since the EU 
referendum result. 
The average gold price during 2016 was £926 per troy ounce (2015: £759), 
a 22.1% increase. The gold price directly impacts the revenue received  
on the sales of scrapped gold.
GOLD PURCHASING
Gross profits from Gold Purchasing increased 69.6% to £3.9m (2015: £2.3m) 
principally as a result of the increase in gold price and the different trends 
in the gold price through the year versus 2015. 
H&T purchase gold to achieve a particular margin and it takes around two 
months to process items directly to scrap. If the gold price increases during 
this processing period then our margins are enhanced, if it reduces then 
our margins are compressed.
During 2015, the gold price fell by 7% from January to December,  
whereas during the same period in 2016 it increased by 29%.  
Accordingly, our margins were significantly enhanced in 2016 vs 2015.
We estimate that overall volumes of fine gold purchased fell by 3.2%  
from 2015 to 2016.

OTHER SERVICES
The continued improvements both in FX and Buyback increased gross 
profits from the Other Services segment by 43.6% to £5.6m (2015: £3.9m).
Buyback has been a particular success as part of the “We buy anything” 
proposition as the value purchased increased to £8.5m (2015: £6.0m).  
We continue to develop the product through systems development 
supporting the identification, testing and valuation of items to reduce 
transaction time and accuracy in store. 
This development will be supported through further enhancements  
in 2017 together with closer integration of online and in-store systems  
to support the “clicks to bricks” customer acquisition process.
FX continues to grow with sales of currency increasing 86.3% from  
2015 as a result of increased customer awareness and the introduction  
of a wider range of currencies. The volatility in exchange rates as a result  
of the EU referendum also assisted the 105.0% growth in the value  
of currency purchased. 
PROSPECTS
The Group is evolving into a provider of alternative credit services  
to serve an increasing customer base. The development in 2016 has  
been very encouraging and provides a platform for growth into 2017. 
Current trading is in line with management’s expectations for 2017. 
I would also like to add my great thanks to those of the chairman,  
in recognising all of our people whose skills, commitment and enthusiasm 
continue to drive our success, and who give us confidence in the future.

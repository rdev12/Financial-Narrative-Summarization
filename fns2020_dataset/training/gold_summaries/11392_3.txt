CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT
I am pleased to report another successful 
year for the Group after the record results 
in 2013. NWF has delivered results ahead 
of market expectations and has performed 
strongly in spite of some adverse market 
conditions. Whilst the business did not 
benefit from similar weather conditions 
or increasing commodity prices, planned 
management actions in each of the 
businesses have enabled the Group to 
deliver this year’s results. Market share 
increased in Feeds following investment 
in sales and marketing. Food delivered 
a strong result through completing the 
planned restructuring and agreed long-term 
customer contracts to fill the Wardle facility. 
In spite of reduced demand for heating oil 
in the year resulting from the warm winter 
and spring, Fuels delivered a solid result 
through increasing sales of other products, 
particularly gas oil and focusing on 
operational efficiencies.
The successful acquisition of S.C. Feeds 
Limited in November 2013 was in line with 
the Group’s strategy to invest further 
in agriculture and has been earnings 
enhancing in 2014, growing volumes 
in a shrinking market.
Results
Revenue for the year was down 1.5% 
to £537.7 million (2013: £545.8 million) 
and operating profit was down to 
£8.5 million against the record prior 
year (2013: £9.4 million). The decrease 
in revenue was a result of lower oil 
prices and a small reduction in overall 
fuel volumes. 
The Feeds division delivered a good 
performance, increasing volumes in the 
dairy and beef segments to more than 
offset lower levels of demand for sheep 
feed. Volume growth was also achieved 
post acquisition in S.C. Feeds against 
a backdrop of lower market volumes. 
The Food division operates in a tough 
market where overall volumes are static. 
Action by management to consolidate all 
activities at Wardle and agree long-term 
contracts with key customers has delivered 
the planned increase in operating efficiency 
and profitability. Fuels has been negatively 
impacted by the warm winter and 
subsequent lack of demand for heating 
oil, which it has mitigated by focusing on 
operating efficiency and increasing sales 
of other products, most notably gas oil.
Headline profit before taxation was down 
9.4% to £7.7 million (2013: £8.5 million) 
and profit after taxation was down 7.0% 
to £5.3 million (2013: £5.7 million). 
Headline basic earnings per share were 
down 5.3% to 12.4p (2013: 13.1p) and 
headline diluted earnings per share were 
down by 4.6% to 12.4p (2013: 13.0p).

ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2014 03
Cash flows and funding 
The Group generated a £9.6 million 
(2013: £10.4 million) net cash inflow 
from operating activities. This included 
a net working capital inflow of £1.1 million 
(2013: £0.4 million), as the Group continues 
to focus on working capital and cash 
management. Net cash absorbed 
by investing activities increased from 
£1.9 million to £9.7 million as a result 
of a £1.3 million increase in capital 
expenditure (net of disposal proceeds) 
and £6.5 million attributable to the 
acquisition of S.C. Feeds Limited. Overall 
net debt at 31 May 2014 was £11.7 million 
(31 May 2013: £9.2 million). 
Cash conversion was 112.9% 
(2013: 110.6%), measured as net cash 
generated from operating activities as 
a percentage of operating profit. 
Net debt to EBITDA at 31 May 2014 was 
1.0 times (2013: 0.7 times). Interest cover 
(excluding IAS 19 net pension finance 
cost) for the year was 10.6 times 
(2013: 10.4 times). 
As previously announced, in June the 
Group agreed new long-term facilities 
with Royal Bank of Scotland for five years 
through to October 2019. The facilities 
total £65.0 million and are on improved 
terms, which illustrates the confidence 
they have in supporting the development 
plans of NWF.
Dividend
We are proposing to increase the final 
dividend for the year to 4.1p (2013: 3.8p) 
per share which, if approved at the Annual 
General Meeting, will be payable on 
5 December 2014 to shareholders on 
the register at 31 October 2014 and the 
shares will be marked ex-dividend from 
30 October 2014. Together with the 
interim dividend paid during the year 
of 1.0p (2013: 1.0p) per share, this will 
result in a total dividend increase of 6.3% 
for the year to 5. 1p per share (2013: 4.8p), 
amounting to a total cost of £2.4 million 
(2013: £2.3 million). 
Board 
As previously announced, John Acornley 
and David Southworth stepped down 
from the Board during the year after 
13 and 8 years of service respectively. 
I would like to thank them both for their 
significant contributions to support the 
development and governance of the 
Group during their tenure.
Current trading and prospects
Progress to date in the current financial 
year has been in line with the Board’s 
expectations with all divisions performing 
as planned. We continue to focus on 
development opportunities, both organic 
and through targeted acquisitions.
My thanks go to all who have supported 
NWF through the year both inside and 
outside the Group. I look forward to 
updating shareholders on the Group’s 
progress at the time of the Annual General 
Meeting on 25 September 2014.

Chairman

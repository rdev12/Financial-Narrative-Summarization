As anticipated, FY2016 was a year of integration and investment as the Industry continued 
to transform and evolve. The Company focused on its Core capabilities of mobile, video and 
programmatic trading, which now represent over 70% of revenues, compared with less than 50% 
last year. The Company deliberately drew down certain historical Non-Core product lines that were 
 top-line growth.
Key business highlights for the year include:
 programmatic trading, which grew to $116M (FY2015: $103M) and now represent 70% of total 
revenues (FY2015: 48%, FY2014: 25%); 
  Invested approximately $20M in research and development to build and launch integrated 
programmatic platform, ending the Period with a strong debt-free balance sheet with over $78M 
in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities;
 
the usual fourth quarter seasonality;
  Executed planned drawdown of certain historical, Non-Core product lines, which are no longer 
strategic to Company or Industry growth, reducing annual revenues by over $60M;
  Approximately $81M of the statutory loss before taxation of $94.3M was non-cash in nature, 
 
 restructuring at a cost of $3M, to better align the Company’s cost structure with Core products, 
operations and market dynamics; 
 programmatic trading platform that drove over 68% growth in programmatic revenues  
year-on-year, well ahead of Industry growth rates; 
  Programmatic platform volumes grew over 1,200% during the Period, trending to almost  
1.2 trillion requests per month in Q42016 since production launch in September 2015;
  The RhythmOne platform ranks #5 in quality and #6 by volume, as measured by Pixalate  
(April 2016) and comScore (March 2016) respectively, featuring within the top 5% of the 
competitive set;

  Added 27 programmatic demand side partners, including marquee platforms such as DataXu, 
MediaMath, BidSwitch, Criteo and The Trade Desk;

Overview
In 2014 Coats’ reported revenues marginally 
declined to $1,685.9 million from $1,703.7 
million in 2013. On a like-for-like basis 
Coats’ revenues grew 1% during 2014, with 
5% growth in Industrial sales and a 9% 
decline in Crafts. The decline in demand for 
fashion handknitting products in both 
North America and EMEA impacted 
performance in Crafts, suppressing growth 
in group sales. The decline on a reported 
basis reflected the translation impact of a 
strengthening US Dollar against currencies 
such as the Brazilian Real and the Indian 
Rupee.
Coats’ pre-exceptional operating profit 
declined 1% year-on-year on a reported 
basis and remained stable on a like-for-like 
basis at $130.9 million. Industrial delivered a 
like-for-like 18% improvement, driven by 
increased sales, while inflationary cost rises 
continued to be offset with procurement 
and productivity improvements coupled 
with pricing initiatives. Crafts was primarily 
impacted by a decline in sales, as well as by 
one-off costs. However performance in the 
second half improved in line with guidance 
issued in the 2014 half year results. 
Operating profit included approximately  
$8 million of reorganisation related costs 
that have not been classified as exceptional.
Industrial
Industrial sales in 2014 were $1,243.1 
million, up 5% year-on-year, continuing the 
positive momentum from 2013. Revenue 
growth was balanced across the regions 
with double digit growth in the key markets 
of Turkey, the USA and Vietnam. Speciality 
sales grew 14% year-on-year, and by 18% 
in the second half of 2014, with strong 
demand from the protective clothing 
markets in EMEA and North America and 
the outdoor and sporting goods markets in 
Asia. Operating profit growth of 18% 
year-on-year was delivered through volume 
growth, with productivity and purchasing 
improvements, coupled with pricing 
initiatives, successfully offsetting cost 
inflation.
Crafts
Crafts’ sales of $442.8 million represented a 
9% year-on-year decline. The reduction in 
both the Americas and EMEA was primarily 
due to lower demand for fashion 
handknitting products. Excluding this 
anticipated decline, North American Crafts 
sales grew 3% year-on-year. Sales in EMEA 
were also impacted by a decline in the 
Needlecrafts category and a change in 
Coats’ Scandinavian operating model. As a 
result of improved sales performance in the 
Americas and cost reduction initiatives the

Sale of EMEA Crafts
As announced on 19 February 2015 Coats 
has agreed to sell the EMEA Crafts business 
to the Aurelius Group. The sale follows a 
comprehensive review of the business, 
including its strategic fit within Coats, and 
the formulation of a turnaround plan. The 
sale better positions Coats for future 
profitable growth and allows it to focus 
attention on its high performing global 
Industrial and strong Americas Crafts 
businesses. The sale is subject to a limited 
number of conditions usual for this type of 
transaction and is expected to complete in 
Q2 2015. Further details of the transaction 
are included on page 17.
Financial summary
Net profit attributable to equity 
shareholders increased 21% to $45.1 
million, on a reported pre-exceptional basis, 
compared to 2013 ($37.3 million). This was 
primarily due to lower pension finance 
costs, reduced finance costs resulting from 
lower year-on-year net debt and average 
interest rates, and a lower tax charge. 
Pensions finance costs will be significantly 
higher in 2015 due to the increase in the 
pensions deficit of the Coats Plan during 
2014. Including exceptional items and their 
associated tax effect, including an $18.8 
million impairment charge of property, plant 
and equipment and intangible assets 
relating to the EMEA Crafts business, Coats 
generated a reported attributable profit of 
$21.2 million (2013: $29.2 million). No 
exceptional reorganisation charges were 
incurred in 2014. Operating profit included 
approximately $8 million of reorganisation 
related costs that have not been classified 
as exceptional.
In 2014 Coats generated adjusted free cash 
flow
a
 of $70.1 million, a 30% increase on 
2013 ($54.1 million). The year-on-year 
improvement was driven by improved 
working capital management, lower interest 
and tax payments. Reflecting strong cash 
generation, year-end net debt fell to  
$262.6 million (2013: $329.2 million) and 
Coats’ leverage ratio
b
 of net debt to EBITDA 
fell to 1.4 times (2013: 1.8 times).
Return on capital employed
c
 increased to 
26% (2013: 22%), primarily driven by the 
reduction in net working capital.
Prospects
A mixed regional picture in consumer 
demand for Coats’ products is expected to 
continue in 2015. While Coats anticipates a 
broadly positive outlook in Asia and solid 
growth in North America, the situation in 
Europe is likely to be affected by underlying 
macroeconomic developments and Latin 
America is expected to remain relatively flat. 
In a general deflationary environment it will 
become increasingly challenging to use 
pricing improvements to offset payroll and 
other inflationary pressures which Coats 
faces in the many countries in which it 
operates.
In the core Apparel and Footwear business 
there will be an increased focus on 
customer engagement and order 
management using digital channels, while 
in the Speciality business continued growth 
is expected to be achieved through 
geographic expansion and new product 
innovation in areas such as aramids and 
composites. Year-on-year performance in 
the Americas Crafts business is expected to 
remain relatively stable, as ongoing growth 
in core handknitting sales will be offset by 
reduced demand for fashion handknitting 
products.
The mixed consumer demand outlook, 
ongoing inflationary challenges and a 
continued strengthening of the US dollar 
will have a negative impact on operating 
profits in 2015. This will be somewhat 
mitigated by the treatment of losses 
attributable to EMEA Crafts as discontinued 
items, leading to a broadly stable operating 
profit for the year, with profitability 
weighted towards the second half. 
Attributable profit will be reduced by an 
increase in pensions finance costs, which 
should be offset by a continuing reduction 
in the effective tax rate and interest 
charges.
Conclusion
The underlying results for the year 
demonstrate a strengthening of the core 
Apparel and Footwear business, double 
digit sales growth within Speciality and a 
strong and profitable Americas Crafts 
business. This enabled Coats to deliver 
growth in pre-exceptional attributable profit 
and to generate significant free cash flow, 
which provides a strong base for organic 
and inorganic growth.

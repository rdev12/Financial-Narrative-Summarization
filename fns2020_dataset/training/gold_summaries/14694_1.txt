Sportingbet Plc Annual Report 2012
Business Review
Chief 
Executive’ s 
review
Sportingbet is one of the world’s leading 
online gaming operators with divisions 
focused on Australia, Europe and Emerging 
Markets. The Group’s Australian division 
is based in Darwin and Sydney, operating 
under a licence provided by the Northern 
Territory Government. The European 
operation is based in the Channel Islands 
and Malta, operating under licences 
provided by the Alderney Gambling Control 
Commission, Spain, Italy, Denmark and 
Malta. This is supported by an operational 
centre in Dublin providing customer services 
and administrative support. In total the 
Group now employs over 690 people. 
 
Betting on sports is at the heart of the 
Sportingbet business, accounting for 76% 
(2011: 71%) of Group gross gaming revenue. 
Football has been our main product for 
many years accounting for 46% of gross 
gaming revenue, however the reshaping of 
the Group has resulted in a better diversified 
revenue stream with 33% coming from 
Australian horse‑ racing. The commitment 
to offering a wide range of betting markets 
remains with over 31 sports covered.
In:play, betting whilst the event is happening, 
remains a very significant component of 
revenue in our European and Emerging 
Markets business accounting for 61% of 
the amounts wagered. Our in:play margin 
of 9.7% (2011: 9.9%) continues to be 
the highest in the industry as a result of 
our experienced trading team, bespoke 
technology and wide product offering. 
While sports betting remains the focus 
of the business, we provide a complete 
range of other gaming products to our 
customers including casino, games and 
poker. Casino and games contribute 18% 
of Group gross gaming revenue whilst 
poker makes up the remaining 6%. These 
products are not offered to our Australian 
customers due to regulatory constraints.

The Group has had a solid start to the new 
financial year in line with our expectations.
With over 80% of our revenue coming from 
regulated countries we are confident that 
the increased advertising opportunities, 
improved payment processing and 
stable business platform provided by 
our regulated market presence will drive 
profitable growth in the medium term.
Whilst the economic outlook remains 
challenging, our robust position gives us 
confidence for the current financial year.

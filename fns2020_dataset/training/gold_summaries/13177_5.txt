 “The first contribution from the new generation wells 
commenced in October 2009 from meX-106, followed by 
SV-58 with initial production from this well commencing in 
January 2010. The combination of a rig equipped with high 
performance equipment and specifically designed bits has 
increased the rate of penetration.”

Regal’s assets
Regal’s assets are located in three countries: Ukraine, Romania 
and Egypt. 
The primary asset is a large gas and condensate field extending 
over two production licences (100% Regal owned and operated) 
in north eastern Ukraine. The reserves were independently 
audited by Ryder Scott in 2005 who provided an estimate for 
proven and probable (“2P”) reserves of 169 MMboe. 
Regal also owns two large exploration licences in Romania — 
the Barlad and Suceava Blocks. These are held 100% and 
50%, respectively, by Regal. Gas has been discovered on both 
blocks following exploration drilling.
In addition, the Company owns a 25% non-operated interest in 
the East Ras Budran concession in Egypt which is an onshore 
block operated by Apache.
Operationally, 2009 has been a year of high activity. In total, four 
wells were spud, two of which are now on production. Despite 
the challenges encountered in drilling these first wells, we have 
achieved very considerable speed and efficiency improvements. 
We can now also say with some confidence that we have a 
better understanding of the reservoirs and their behaviour. Key 
contributors to this have been the application of different 
techniques and the use of modern materials and equipment 
specifically imported into the country. Uppermost is the 
operational team on the ground, with their experience and 
resourcefulness. Production started to rise in autumn 2009 and 
continued through into the first quarter of 2010, with average 
production in 2009 showing a 64% rise on that of 2008. No 
Lost Time Incidents were incurred and a total of 900,549 
man-hours were recorded for the year. Over two million 
man-hours of staff and contractor time without a Lost Time 
Incident have now been recorded to date.

Asset Overview
Regal Petroleum Corporation Limited (a wholly 
owned subsidiary in the Regal Group) holds a 
100% working interest and is the operator of 
the Mekhediviska-Golotvshinska (“MEX-GOL ”) 
and Svyrydivske (“SV”) fields that extend over a 
combined area of 269 km², approximately 200 
km east of Kiev. The two licences are adjacent 
and the interests are operated and managed as 
one field.
The field is located, geologically, towards the 
middle of the Dnieper-Donets sedimentary 
basin which extends across most of north-east 
Ukraine. The vast majority of Ukrainian gas and 
condensate production lies within this basin. 
The reservoir comprises a series of gently 
dipping Carboniferous sandstones of Visean 
Age (“B-Sands”) interbedded with shales that 
form stratigraphic traps at around 4,700 metres 
below the surface, with a gross thickness 
between 800 metres and 1,000 metres. 
Analysis suggests that these deposits range 
from fluvial to deltaic in origin. Below these 
reservoirs is a thick sequence of shale above 
deeper, similar, sandstones which are 
encountered at a depth of around 5,800 
metres. These are of Tournasian Age 
(“T-Sands”) and also sandstones from the older 
Devonian Period (“D-Sands”). 
The field was originally discovered in the 1960s 
during the Soviet era, with wells being drilled 
sporadically over the years since then by State 
companies. Only limited investment had been 
made in developing the asset further with 
equally limited, consequential, production. 
Between 2000 and 2004, the former Regal/
Chernihivnaftagasgeologia (CNGG) joint 
venture drilled two development/appraisal 
wells, MEX-102 and SV-52, and successfully 
completed three work-overs on Soviet era wells. 
The Ukrainian Government declared the fields 
commercial in December 2003 and 20 year 
production licences (MEX-GOL and SV) were 
awarded to Regal in July 2004. 
Over 20 wells had been drilled into the 
B-Sands prior to 2004, resulting in the Ryder 
Scott 2P reserves estimate in 2005 of 169 
MMboe. However, only five wells had managed 
to penetrate the deeper T-Sands sequence, and 
none of the rigs used at the time had the 
capacity to drill all the way through this T-Sands 
sequence and into the deeper D-Sands. The 
five wells provided, at the time, a tantalising 
glimpse of potential upside by the discovery of 
gas where, in some wells, individual T-Sands 
were tested and flowed at between 20 and 80 
Mm³/d. It was not until the acquisition of 3D 
seismic data and its interpretation in 2008 that 
the huge, lateral extent of the T-Sands and 
underlying D-Sands became apparent. The new 
generation wells in 2009 have targeted 
production from the B-Sands reservoirs, but 
have also been drilled with the intention of 
properly appraising these deeper T and 
D-Sands deposits for the first time. Regal 
believes that there is significant upside 
potential from these deeper sands and the  18

2009 and, after reaching TD at 6,309 metres in September 
2009, was moved to the SV-66 location nearby, which was 
spud in November 2009. Consequently, four new production 
wells were spud on the Company’s Ukrainian licences 
during 2009.
Drilling performance has been striking. Previous local rigs had 
typically taken between a year and two years to reach depths 
of 5,000 to 5,500 metres on Regal’s MEX-GOL and SV 
licences. MEX-106 took little more than 120 days to reach 
comparable depth and there has been an improvement in 
drilling performance with each successive well. The 
combination of a rig equipped with high performance 
equipment including drilling motors, turbines and purposely 
selected and specifically designed bits, such as diamond 
impregnated and polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bits, 
has increased the rate of penetration, dramatically reduced 
the number of bits required and increased the bit on bottom 
time and bit life. The new rigs also have the capacity to drill 
deeper, with MEX-106 drilled to 6,020 metres, inside seven 
months and the successive wells even faster. SV-58 reached 
6,309 metres and the fourth well, SV-66, reached 5,000 
metres in less than 90 days (before drilling deeper), which is 
more than four times faster than with the previous local rigs. 
Lessons learned from each successive well should enable 
future wells to be drilled faster resulting in lower drilling time 
and consequent cost reduction. The main objective of 
MEX-106 was to determine the productivity of the B-Sands 
target and to bring this into production. Wireline logs identified 
33 metres of net reservoir in the B-Sands sequence between 
4,800 and 5,250 metres depth. In addition to this, a further 11 
metres of net reservoir was identified in the secondary, 
T-Sand objective. At 5,830 metres the well encountered, for 
the first time on this field, potential Devonian reservoirs and 
27 metres of net reservoir was logged between this depth 
and the bottom of the well. However, whilst perforating to flow 
the well in the deeper section one of the perforation guns 
became lodged in the production tubing, thereby restricting 
Company aims to continue to appraise and, hopefully, produce 
from such deeper sands in the future.
Production
2009 commenced with a significant production increase from 
MEX-102, which had been recently worked over and brought 
back on line in late 2008. The first contribution from the 
new-generation wells commenced in October 2009 from 
MEX-106, followed by SV-58 with initial production from this  
well commencing in January 2010. At present, the main 
contribution from both wells is from the B-Sands sequence. In 
MEX-106, an intervention is required to remove an obstruction 
from the production tubing that is preventing access to the 
lower T and D-Sand sections of the well and in SV-58 high 
pressures in the deeper sections of the well have restricted 
access to those sections. 
The Company’s average production over the 12 month period 
to 31 December 2009 was 163,982 m³/d (5.79 MMcf/d) of 
gas and 42.5 m³/d of condensate, which equates to a 
combined total oil equivalent of 1,232 boepd, which is a 64% 
increase on the previous year. The monthly average production 
with both MEX-106 and SV-58 on line increased to 1,927 
boepd in January 2010. This growth is significant as it 
represents a real turning point from below 500 boepd in late 
2008, reflecting the tangible effect of investment starting to 
produce results.
Field Development
Regal contracted two new top-drive 2,000 hp Lewco rigs 
from Saipem S.p.A. in 2008 on a long term basis. These rigs 
arrived in the Ukraine, on schedule, to spud the first of the 
new-generation deep gas and condensate production wells in 
early 2009. The first rig spudded MEX-106 in the western 
side of the field in January 2009 and after reaching target 
depth (TD) of 6,020 metres in July 2009, the rig was 
relocated to the eastern side of the field to spud SV-61 in 
September 2009. The second rig spudded SV-58 in February 
ukraine continued 19

Chief Operating Officer’s Review
access to the lower part of the well. Only the upper reservoirs 
in MEX-106, therefore, were initially brought on stream. Flow 
from these reservoirs had built up to approximately 75,000 
m³/day (2.6 MMcf/d) of gas and to 75 boepd of condensate 
towards the end of the year. It is the intention to remove the 
obstruction through work-over activities in Q2 2010.
The second well, SV-58, also encountered potential reservoirs 
in the B, T and D-Sands, with estimated net pay of 60 metres 
from the B-Sands to the T-3 Sands. The available logs from 
the T-4 Sands to the D-Sands show an estimated pay 
thickness of 65 metres. In addition to similar sands to those 
encountered in the MEX-106 well, a 120 metre thick 
limestone was also discovered towards the lower part of the 
B-Sands sequence. This well proved to be a real challenge as 
several over-pressured gas-kicks had to be controlled whilst 
drilling, with the first encountered upon entering the 
limestone. The mud-weight was loaded to a specific gravity of 
1.95 in order to control the well. After this well section was 
cased, it was decided to defer bringing the lower part of the 
well into production pending further evaluation of the possible 
expected high pressures. Consequently, only the B-Sands 
sequence was selectively perforated. The well test indicated a 
low connectivity with the formation and a higher than 
expected ratio of gas to condensate. To increase the 
connectivity and productivity of the well, a jet perforating “trial” 
was undertaken whereby perforations were made using an 
abrasive jet slurry of water and sand. This technique resulted 
in a significant increase in productivity in the test zone. The 
well was taken on production while preparing for a full-scale 
jet perforating intervention in combination with the use of 
other advanced perforation techniques to further enhance 
production.
The third well, SV-61, was spudded in September 2009 and 
drilled to a total depth of 5,969 metres, which was reached on 
12 January 2010. A total of 22 metres of net pay was logged 
over the B-Sands (B-20 to the top of the B-23). A slotted 
liner was run to case the 6" hole section. The jet perforating 
trial was extended to SV-61 where a pipe conveyed jet 
perforating programme was executed to perforate the 7" 
casing using the drilling rig equipment. 
The fourth well, SV-66, was spudded on 23 November 2009 
and drilled to a depth of 5,894 metres and the fifth well, MEX 
120, was spudded on 12 April 2010.
The subsurface model of the field was completed by the end 
of 2009. The model is being continuously updated with the 
data obtained from the newly drilled wells to refine the model 
and to increase its accuracy.  20

Romania
The Company has continued to explore its Romanian assets, the 
Barlad block (Regal 100% and operator) and the Suceava block 
(Regal 50% non-operated).
In the Barlad block, 104.7 km of 2D seismic was acquired 
between November 2009 and early January 2010 with an 
interruption due to the severe winter weather. The remaining 
licence commitment on this block at year end was the drilling of 
an additional well, and this well is scheduled for spud in Q3 
2010. A nine month extension on this drilling commitment was 
granted to allow the evaluation of the new seismic data so as to 
more accurately position this exploration well. Towards the end 
of the year, work commenced on assessing the shale gas 
potential of the block. The initial reservoir target within the 
concession area is the shallower Palaeozoic Formation which 
has six potential structural leads that can also be seen in the 
deeper Silurian on 2D seismic data.  Additional confirmation of 
the presence of the Silurian Formation has been confirmed by 
the Regal SE1 well in the adjacent Suceava block, where the 
formation was intercepted at a depth of 1,950 metres. Based on 
the information available all the necessary requirements for a 
successful shale gas play can be found within the Barlad block. 
In the Suceava block, the 2D seismic data acquired during the 
year has enabled the identification of a modest sized gas 
prospect 2.5 km to the east of the Vicsani discovery in the 
neighbouring Brodina Concession, also operated by Aurelian Oil 
& Gas plc. It is intended to drill a shallow gas well to meet the 
remaining work programme obligations during 2010. Work has 
established that the Vicsani field in the adjacent Brodina 
Concession extends into the Suceava block and further work to 
assess the relative contribution of reserves from the Suceava 
and Brodina concessions respectively is currently underway. It is 
anticipated that a net share of between 7.5% and 15% of the 
field’s production will be assigned to Regal on settlement of a 
proportional contribution to the historic cost associated with  
this field. 
egypt
The Company holds a 25% non-operated interest in the East 
Ras Budran concession in the Gulf of Suez, Egypt through a 
joint venture with Apache as operator. Exploration and appraisal 
work has continued at the concession although the overall level 
of activity has been relatively low this year. The main focus has 
been the identification of new prospects. Data was acquired to 
develop a digital elevation model (DEM) of an area which was 
less accessible to seismic acquisition. This was followed by a 
ground control point (GCP) survey. The geo-rectification, 
interpretation and field mapping was ongoing at the year end.  
In addition, a survey was undertaken on the fractured Eocene 
carbonates in the East Ras Budran area to further understand 
reservoir behaviour. 
A work-over on the ERB-A-1X well, drilled in 2007, was required 
to replace a failed Electric Submersible Pump (ESP). Owing to 
difficulties experienced pulling the ESP, operations were 
suspended.
The 2010 plan for Egypt includes the further development of 
the field on the back of the discovery in the ERB-A-1X well. 21

Chief Executive’s report
EnQuest’s performance, business 
model and strategy, in a low oil price 
environment
EnQuest is working hard and is performing 
well in addressing the challenges of the 
low oil price environment. EnQuest is 
strengthening its balance sheet, delivering 
on production and execution targets and 
streamlining operations. EnQuest has a long 
standing culture and practice of rigorous cost 
discipline, essential in the current market 
conditions. EnQuest has actively hedged oil 
prices to protect its investment programme; 
hedging added $261.2 million to EBITDA in 
2015. In addition, in 2016, 10 million barrels 
are hedged at an average of $68 per barrel. 
Execution in 2015 was marked by first oil from 
Alma/Galia, a transformation in performance 
from the Greater Kittiwake Area, substantial 
further progress on the Kraken development 
and a material first full year contribution from 
EnQuest’s business in Malaysia. 
Production averaged 36,567 Boepd in 2015, 
above the upper end of the target range and 
up 31% on 2014, with production in H2 in 
particular strong across the portfolio. 
Production in H2 2015 was up 49% on H1, 
with the strong finish to the year including 
both November and December averaging 
over 50,000 Boepd. The Alma/Galia 
development was brought onstream in late 
October and the Kraken development was on 
schedule overall, with the drilling programme 
ahead of schedule. I am pleased to report an 
excellent operating performance overall. 
Controlling costs and managing operations 
in an agile and efficient manner are core 
EnQuest competencies. Given the macro 
environment, EnQuest has driven even more 
operational streamlining initiatives, both in 
terms of pace and scale. 2015 unit operating 
costs were delivered ahead of target at 
$29.7/bbl. With further persistent granular 
work on all aspects of the operating cost 
base, EnQuest has improved its operating 
targets further, and in 2016 is on course 
to achieve an average unit opex in the 
range $25-27/bbl. This is achieved through 
both production increases and ongoing 
material cost reductions. Further unit opex 
reductions are set to follow, when the 
low operational costs of the Kraken and 
Scolty/Crathes developments are brought 
fully onstream. The resulting unit opex base 
will be in the low $20s per barrel, providing 
a sustainable lower cost base in a lower oil 
price environment. 
In December 2015, the capex cost of the 
overall Kraken development was reduced by 
c.$300 million, and in early 2016 by a further 
c.$125 million. The 2015 drilling programme 
was delivered below budget, with very high 
efficiency levels across our operated rigs 
and with significantly lowered supplier rates. 
Given the low oil price environment, in H1 
2015, EnQuest negotiated a relaxation of 
covenants to its revolving credit facility 
and in its retail bond until mid-2017. This 
continued commitment from the lenders 
recognised the cash flow generation of 
EnQuest’s business and in particular those 
expected from the Kraken development. 
With 2016 capex focused on Kraken, net 
debt is planned to increase during 2016 
ahead of Kraken first oil. 
EnQuest produced 13.3 MMboe of oil in 
2015, which combined with the impact of 
lowered future oil price assumptions and the 
inclusion of a 10.5% increase in the Kraken 
working interest, resulted in a 2% decrease 
in overall net 2P reserves to 216 MMboe at 
the start of 2016. EnQuest has increased 
net oil reserves by 135 MMboe over the 
last six years, and converted the equivalent 
of 68% of its original 81 MMboe reserves 
into flowing barrels. Notwithstanding the 
reductions to the investment programme, 
EnQuest remains on course to achieve 
annual net production well in excess of 
50,000 Boepd, with six operated producing 
hubs in the UK and with the PM8/Seligi hub 
in Malaysia. Beyond Kraken, PM8/Seligi in 
particular has the potential to increase 
international production significantly 
over the coming years. 
“EnQuest’s high operating 
efficiency, great execution 
and low cost capabilities are 
essential for the challenges 
of current market conditions.”

Empowerment
EnQuest ensures that each employee 
feels empowered to deliver on the 
projects within their control. This 
sense of authority promotes efficiency 
and diligence within the organisation. 
It also allows EnQuest to be managed 
by a more nimble team. In the current 
landscape, this ability to readily adapt 
to market conditions provides us with 
a competitive advantage.

Health, Safety, Environment and 
Assurance (‘HSE&A’)
In 2015, EnQuest met its commitment to 
deliver safe results. 
In its UK operations, the frequency of 
Dangerous Occurrences (incidents with the 
potential to cause a major accident, such as 
hydrocarbon releases, dropped objects and 
lifting incidents) reduced by more than 30% 
from 2014, with only relatively minor incidents 
reported. The Lost-Time Injury (‘LTI’) 
Frequency Rate and the Recordable Injury 
Frequency Rate both remained low at 2.14 
and 4.99 incidents per million man hours 
respectively; with the producing North Sea 
assets Kittiwake, Northern Producer and 
Heather achieving 10 years, 43 months 
and 34 months LTI free respectively.
In 2015 EnQuest also had a total of 11 
safety and environmental inspections of its 
operated assets by UK regulators (Health 
and Safety Executive and Department of 
Energy & Climate Change) with no reported 
enforcement action.

Chief Executive’s report continued
In Malaysia, EnQuest delivered an excellent 
occupational health and safety performance, 
with no lost time injuries from 1.7 million 
man hours worked and only one 
recordable incident. 
These results are a testament to EnQuest’s 
unceasing focus on HSE&A.
North Sea operations
In 2015, EnQuest delivered strong 
production of 27,505 Boepd in the UK, 
13% up on 2014. This reflects the continuing 
strength of field reservoir performance and 
continuing high production efficiency from 
EnQuest’s existing UK assets and the 
inclusion of first production from Alma Galia. 
In 2015, EnQuest’s North Sea operations 
delivered an impressive operating 
performance. First oil from the Ythan 
development was achieved five months 
earlier than scheduled and produced oil 
was sustained at higher than expected rates. 
At Thistle, the success of the initial three 
well drilling programme resulted in further 
activity being added. These wells were 
delivered at 25% under budget, with three 
of the wells drilled having already achieved 
payback within 2015. The transformational 
post acquisition performance at the Greater 
Kittiwake Area (‘GKA’) has continued, with 
2015 reported production of 3,981 Boepd 
compared to 1,281 Boepd in 2014. The 
sidetracking of the Gadwall well and 
resolution of gas-lift issues on Grouse 
were highlights of the 2015 programme 
of well rejuvenation and improved 
production efficiency. 
Savings have been achieved across the 
business; GKA reduced unit opex from 
above $100/bbl, at the time of its acquisition, 
to below $30/bbl, partly due to significant 
increases in production, but also to cost 
reduction. EnQuest is continuing to work with 
the supply chain and contractors to achieve 
further cost savings and optimisation. 
North Sea developments
Alma/Galia 
First oil from the Alma/Galia development 
was achieved on 27 October 2015, following 
final commissioning of all the required 
systems. This final commissioning took 
longer than anticipated, due mainly to more 
work than expected being required on the 
cargo systems, as became apparent during 
testing, which was only possible when the 
vessel was offshore and in situ. 
Production was increased in the second 
half of November as the Galia well was also 
brought onstream, adding to production 
from the first two Alma wells. The EnQuest 
Producer FPSO vessel performed well in 
2015 and the first cargo offload was 
completed in December 2015.
Kraken 
During 2015, the Kraken project again 
progressed well. The development project 
proceeded on schedule, and by the end of 
the year capex costs for the overall project 
had been reduced by c.10%, bringing the 
expected gross capex down to c.$2.9 billion. 
The fixed pipelines for the first two Kraken 
drill centres were installed on the seabed in 
H1 2015. Installation of the mooring system 
for the FPSO was started. Following 
manufacture, the submerged turret/buoy 
was transported to the field and successfully 
installed. Drill centre one (‘DC1’) was fully 
connected to the turret/buoy, at the year 
end only one production riser was still to 
be connected from the second drill centre.
In H2 2015, following the completion of the 
Kraken batch top-hole drilling programme 
at DC1, the drilling rig progressed with 
the pre-drilling of individual wells into the 
reservoir. This element of the project was 
ahead of schedule in 2015, contributing 
to the reduction in overall project capex. 
Reservoir analysis of the two full well 
penetrations to the end of 2015 
correlated closely with the 
previous subsurface prognosis. 
The conversion programme for the Kraken 
FPSO vessel continued on plan, with the 
vessel on track for delivery in 2016. 
Scolty/Crathes
The Scolty/Crathes development received 
regulatory approval and was sanctioned 
by EnQuest in H2 2015. EnQuest is the 
operator of the development, with a 50% 
working interest. The project benefits from 
limited cash capital expenditure until 
first oil in 2017 and extends field life for 
the GKA field. Including this field life 
extension, unit capital costs for the 
project are under $20/bbl. Unit 
operating cost should be under $15/
bbl in the initial peak volume years. 
The fields will be tied back to the Kittiwake 
platform, in the Greater Kittiwake Area. 
The potential for such a tie back was part 
of the rationale for the acquisition of GKA. 
Production from the Scolty/Crathes fields is 
expected to continue until 2025; this also 
extends the life of the GKA hub itself to 2025. 
Development well drilling is anticipated by 
mid-2016, with first oil from Scolty/Crathes 
expected by the first half of 2017. 
The cost of the tie back and the work 
required on the topsides of the Kittiwake 
platform have been agreed on a fixed lump 
sum turnkey basis and will become payable 
after a first oil determined date. 
Malaysia
In 2015, EnQuest’s Malaysian operations 
continued to increase in both significance 
and importance, representing 25% of 
production. PM8/Seligi increased production 
from 3,459 Boepd in 2014 (six months of 
production averaged over the full year), to 
8,689 Boepd in 2015, with well intervention 
activities resulting in a gross production 
increase of approximately 3,000 Boepd in 
Q4 2015. First oil was achieved from Tanjong 
Baram in June 2015, the field was then briefly 
shutdown for changes requested by the host 
platform to accommodate volumes of liquids 
in gas. The changes were engineered and 
implemented extremely quickly, enabling 
rapid restart to production. This type of 
performance typifies EnQuest’s agile 
operational capability. 
Production from PM8/Seligi had already 
covered most of the consideration costs of 
the acquisition before completion and the 
team’s operational performance since then 
has been excellent. 
Investment prioritisation and asset 
disposals
As part of its investment prioritisation 
programme, EnQuest disposed of its 
Norwegian North Sea interests in 2015. 
EnQuest also ceased to have interests in 
Egypt and Tunisia and sold its exploration 
assets in Malaysia. In the UK, it has 
relinquished interests in a number of 
licences since the oil price decline. By the 
end of 2015, EnQuest had interests in 30 UK 
production licences, down from 35 before 
oil prices started to decline steeply in 
H2 2014.  Strategic Report 21
EnQuest PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2015
Financial performance
In 2015, EnQuest generated EBITDA of 
$464.8 million compared with $581.0 million 
in 2014, lower as a result of the lower oil 
prices, as mitigated by hedging income of 
$261.2 million and also by the significant 
action taken on costs. 
Cost reduction measures led to EnQuest’s 
average unit production and transportation 
cost being reduced by $12.4 per barrel, or 
by 29.5% over 2014. 
EnQuest’s funding facilities include c.$900 
million of bonds and a committed credit 
facility of $1.2 billion, plus an accordion of 
up to a further $500 million. At 31 December 
2015, EnQuest had cash and undrawn 
facilities totalling $496.0 million. 
Exceptional items include non-cash post-tax 
impairments of $626.2 million, due to lower 
near term oil price assumptions.
2016 year to date
EnQuest has performed well at the start 
of 2016. At Alma/Galia, six wells have now 
been commissioned and are all expected to 
be onstream by early Q2 2016. 
With effect from 1 January 2016, EnQuest 
acquired an additional 10.5% interest in 
the Kraken development, from First Oil plc, 
bringing EnQuest’s total interest to 70.5%. 
This added approximately $90 million 
to EnQuest’s net Kraken capex to 
first production.
In addition to the c.$300 million Kraken 
capex saving announced in December 2015, 
an additional c.$125 million saving in Kraken’s 
capex has been made, following optimisation 
of the drilling programme. A total of 23 wells 
will now be drilled from three drill centres, 
instead of 25 wells from four drill centres. The 
overall full cycle project costs have now been 
reduced by c.$425 million from $3.2 billion at 
sanction, a reduction of c.13%.
Outlook for the rest of 2016 
and beyond
EnQuest is intent on delivering on execution, 
with safety as the first priority. EnQuest 
remains extremely focused on operational 
efficiency and on further reducing both 
operating and capital costs. 
Total EnQuest production for 2016 
continues to be expected to average 
between 44,000 Boepd and 48,000 Boepd, 
a 26% increase over 2014 at the mid-point of 
the range. 2016 hedging remains in place, 
with 10 million barrels hedged at an average 
of $68 per barrel. 
Action is continuing on all cost fronts, 
including production operations and 
services, fuel costs, logistics, maintenance, 
subsea, manpower, and SVT capital 
programme reductions. Further recent 
progress on these and other operating cost 
areas has enabled EnQuest to improve unit 
operating targets, to between $25-27/bbl 
for 2016. The business continues to target 
additional improvements in 2016, seeking 
low $20s unit opex from the North Sea 
business and mid-teens from Malaysia; the 
latter would effectively enable that business 
to fund its growth from its own cash flow. 
2016 priorities include delivering the 
investment programme on time and on 
budget. Total EnQuest 2016 cash capex 
has been reduced again, now at the low 
end of the previous $700 million to $750 
million range, despite including additional 
capex associated with the 10.5% increase 
in EnQuest’s Kraken working interest. The 
predominant focus areas are the next phases 
of the Kraken development, with the FPSO 
being a critical path element. This has been 
reduced from an equivalent c.$950 million 
original capex budget, including the First 
Oil acquisition. 
Smaller production and development 
companies require high efficiency and 
low cost capabilities, in particular in 
these market conditions. EnQuest has the 
requisite capabilities and with its operating 
costs rebased at materially lowered levels, 
even modest increases in oil prices would 
have a significant positive impact on future 
cash flows and growth. However, for the 
foreseeable future, EnQuest’s priority is to 
continue delivering a business which is 
robust in a low oil price environment.

>
We have achieved a year of good  
results with a highly motivated team  
of employees around the world. Based  
on strong customer focus and the 
implementation of our strategy we have 
built a good momentum of profitable 
growth. In all areas of our business, 
commercially as well as technically,  
we have encouraged new thinking and 
delivered innovative solutions to our 
clients. We made significant progress  
in implementing our three-pillar strategy 
of operational excellence, portfolio 
optimisation and focused growth in 
defined segments and regions. This has 
resulted in tangible progress evidenced  
by solid growth in profitability and 
excellent cash performance.
Business position
Our underlying profit before tax was 
£106.4m, an increase of 7.3% over last 
year’s restated profit¹ of £99.2m, on 
revenue that increased by 2.6% to 
£1.75bn. We believe underlying profit  
is a more representative measure of 
performance, removing the items that 
may give a distorted view of performance. 
In the current year we have removed 
profits on disposals and costs associated 
with disposals of £10.5m (2013: £4.5m), 
amortisation of acquired intangible  
assets of £2.7m (2013: £10.0m), together 
with one-off pension gains in the 2013 
comparative figures of £4.3m arising  
as we continue to actively manage our 
pension liabilities. The unadjusted 
reported profit before tax was £114.2m 
(2013 restated
1
: £98.0m).
The Group’s profit after tax for the year  
of £96.3m (2013 restated
1
: £84.3m)  
is shown in the Consolidated Income 
Statement (page 112).
1  The results for the year to 31 March 2013 have 
been restated to reflect changes to accounting 
standards with regards to the treatment of  
pension costs (IAS 19 (revised 2011)).

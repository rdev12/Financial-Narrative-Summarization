Booker Group plc 
annual report & accounts 2013
Since November 2005 Booker Group 
has been seeking to ‘Focus, Drive and 
Broaden’ the business. We continue to 
make good progress. 
FOCUS  
(commenced November 2005)
Booker seeks to become the most 
efficient operator in our sector. Bryn 
Satherley and his team continue to 
improve business efficiency. We ‘stop, 
simplify and standardise’ work and 
invest most of the savings in customer 
service. Through tight cash management 
we have now increased net cash from 
£63.4m last year to £77.2m this year. 
This is after paying £15.8m as the cash 
consideration for the Makro deal.
DRIVE  
(commenced March 2006)
Booker Wholesale, our cash and carry 
business, served 486,000 customers 
this year up from 465,000 last year. Guy 
Farrant and the team continue to ‘Drive’ 
choice, price and service. Each year 
we survey 40,000 customers to identify 
where improvements can be made. 
Customer satisfaction improved again 
this year and our customer count has 
increased again, by 21,000 customers.
Choice Up
• In 2007 we launched Euro Shopper as 
an entry price brand for independent 
retailers. It now has retail sales of 
£156m. The range has 83 products 
and retailers achieve a minimum of 
30% margin. 
• In 2010 we launched Farm Fresh. 
Sales in the year to 29 March 2013 
were £55m. The quality and freshness 
of the produce is second to none and 
can be delivered to our customers 
within 48 hours of being harvested.
• Chef’s l arder is our own label brand 
for caterers. Sales were £207m, up 
13% on the prior year. Progress has 
been made across the range.
• During the year the UK food industry 
was challenged by horsemeat being 
found in some comminuted beef 
products. Over the past five years 
Booker has made good progress in 
tightening quality requirements and 
supply chain controls. None of our 
products were found to contain horse 
DNA. We will continue to improve 
quality and supply chain control in the 
years ahead.
Prices Down
• Ours is a very price competitive 
market. Every week we monitor 
prices versus competitors and 
during the year our price index 
remained competitive. In the year we 
“locked down” prices for caterers 
which has proved very effective in 
helping caterers plan their menu 
with confidence.
Better Service
• Stock availability further improved  
to be the best we have achieved.
• Our people are doing an excellent job. 
Our customers rate Booker people 
highly. Business Centre teams have 
been trained in PRIDE to help improve 
the Parking, Reception, Internal, 
Delivery and Exit experience.
• We have continued to expand  
and improve our delivery service.
• We have more specialist butchers and 
greengrocers within the business.
Catering
• Catering Sales grew by 6.2% to 
£1.4bn, as our choice, price and 
service continued to improve. Our 
catering development sales force 
continues to serve our existing 
customers and to introduce new 
customers to Booker.

Premier
• Premier, Booker’s symbol group, 
grew by 11%. The estate grew to 
2,802 stores. The retail development 
team has put a lot of work into 
compliance and building the sales 
and profits of existing Premier stores.
BROADEN  
(commenced April 2007)
In the UK, Booker seeks to offer the 
best choice, price and service to 
caterers, retailers and small business. 
We also seek to become the suppliers’ 
preferred route to market. We also want 
to sell new products and services and 
reach new customers. In India we seek 
to become the best supplier to Kirana 
stores. To achieve these objectives, 
we are ‘Broadening’ the business. 
‘Broaden’ includes:
Makro
• The most important change we have 
made to Broaden the Group is the 
acquisition of Makro. Makro serves 
1 million small business customers, 
has great people, good locations 
and excellent products. Through 
Booker and Makro coming together 
we seek to become the UK’s leading 
wholesaler to caterers, retailers and 
small businesses. We will offer our 
customers better choice, prices 
and service via the internet, delivery 
and cash and carry. The transaction 
was cleared by the Competition 
Commission on 19 April 2013 and as 
a result the Makro financials were not 
consolidated into the Group accounts 
for the year to 29 March 2013. The 
real merits of the transaction will 
appear in the next few years. We 
will combine the best ranges from 
Makro and Booker to improve overall 
choice. Through consolidating buying 
volumes we should improve prices 
for customers. Service will improve 
as we have increased capacity for 
delivery, and an integrated supply 
chain will improve availability. This 
should help the Group grow to an 
estimated £6bn of sales in the next 
few years. I am pleased that Steve 
Blan and the team at Makro are 
already settling into the Group. We 
paid for Makro through issuing 9.99% 
of our equity to Metro AG and a cash 
payment of £15.8m. We are delighted 
to have Metro AG as a strategic 
partner and major shareholder. We 
can see opportunities to source with 
Metro AG and to share expertise 
to the benefit of our UK business. 
The transaction has taken a year to 
complete and I am very grateful to all 
in Booker and Makro who have been 
patient during this process.
Improving the cash and carry 
business centre experience
• We have now converted 145 of our 
172 business centres to the ‘Extra’ 
format. This features a lighter, 
brighter business centre environment 
and an improved choice, price and 
service. The conversion pays back in 
around a year and we plan to convert 
a further 5 business centres to ‘Extra’ 
in the year ahead. The lessons from 
Extra will be rolled to the rest of the 
business and to Makro.
Harnessing the Internet
• Sales at booker.co.uk were £704m, 
up from £635m last year and £15m 
in 2005. All these sales are delivered 
to our customers’ premises. We have 
255,000 customers registered on 
the website compared to 170,000 
last year. Customers can view their 
account details, use an iPhone app 
and order products. We have also 
developed our first customer forum 
for Premier customers. 
Booker Direct/Ritter-Courivaud/
Classic Drinks/Chef Direct
• Mark Aylwin and his team are 
building our delivered wholesale 
business. Booker Direct has great 
customers including the prison 
service in England and Wales, Marks 
& Spencer and most of the cinema 
chains in the UK.
• In 2010 we acquired Classic Drinks, 
an on-trade wholesaler supplying 
pubs and licensed customers mainly 
in the North West. We are in the 
process of rolling this expertise out 
on a national basis.
• In 2010 we acquired Ritter-Courivaud, 
a leading speciality food supplier to 
restaurants. Through combining the 
logistics expertise we have in Booker 
Direct, with the catering knowledge 
from Ritter-Courivaud and the 
Groups’ buying scale, we launched 
Chef Direct in 2012. Chef Direct is 
based in Didcot and has won some 
important clients such as Aramark 
and l och Fyne Restaurants.
• In the last year the Group delivered 
£1.1bn of product to retailers and 
caterers in the UK. Through using 
some of the space in the Makro 
business centres we will be able to 
increase our delivered business. 
Booker India 
• In September 2009 we opened our 
first business centre in Mumbai. We 
now have 12,000 customers and 
the customer reaction has been 
excellent. We have also launched 
185 Happy Shopper symbol retailers 
which harness the lessons from 
Premier in the UK for the Kirana 
stores of Mumbai. In 2011 we opened 
our first joint venture business centre 
in Pune. Our partner in Pune is  6

Satnam Arora, who has expertise 
which compliments our own. We now 
have 3 branches in Mumbai and one 
joint venture branch in Pune. We look 
forward to developing the Booker 
offer to become the best choice, 
price and service supplier to Kirana 
stores and caterers. We anticipate 
opening a further two branches in 
2013/14.
Sustainability
• Booker was the first UK food 
wholesaler to be awarded the Carbon 
Trust Standard and the first to 
achieve certification. Booker are also 
The Grocer Gold “Green Wholesaler 
of the Year” 2012.
• Booker ranked higher than any major 
wholesaler or multiple retailer in the 
2012 Government Carbon Reduction 
Commitment league table.
• 13,000 customers are now recycling 
with Booker through the packaging 
and used cooking oil recycling 
services. This helps our customers 
save money, increase recycling 
levels and support more sustainable 
communities throughout the UK.
• Overall Booker recycling volumes are 
up 42% against last year.
• We donated 126,000 meals to charity 
in the last quarter. A national roll out 
is underway for every branch to link 
up with local food charities.
People
• The progress at Booker has been 
achieved by our great team of people. 
We are committed to continuing to 
make Booker better and safer for 
colleagues. We are also developing 
talent. For example, there is a 
shortage of butchers in the trade, so 
we have partnered with the University 
of West l ondon to develop a formal 
“butchery apprenticeship”. 28 new 
butchers graduated this year and 
42 signed up for the next scheme. 
We developed a similar scheme for 
greengrocers with 47 colleagues 
graduating this year and 85 signing 
up for the coming year.
• For the sixth year running, the 
performance of the business means 
our people have shared in our 
success through our bonus system. 
With this great team of people Booker 
will continue to make progress in the 
year ahead. 
• We are delighted to have the team 
at Makro join the Group. Together 
we will build a company which 
improves choice, price and service 
for our customers. 
Our plan to Focus, Drive and Broaden 
the business remains on track. 
Customer satisfaction continued to 
improve and we grew sales by over 
£135m. Most importantly we teamed 
up with Makro. Together Booker and 
Makro will become the UK’s leading 
wholesaler to caterers, retailers and 
small businesses. We will provide 
our customers with improved choice, 
prices and service via the internet, 
delivery and cash and carry. We have 
a great team at Booker and Makro and 
together we will help our customers 
prosper in the year ahead.

04 Allergy Therapeutics plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
Chief Executive’s Review
“One of the striking 
features of the 
G301 outcome is 
the robustness of 
the result.”
The successful outcome of G301, Allergy 
Therapeutics’ pivotal Phase III study of 
Pollinex Quattro Grass, announced on 14 May 
2008 was undoubtedly the most important 
event during the ﬁ nancial year. Conducted 
predominantly in the United States, G301 
was the largest ever Phase III double blind 
placebo controlled study in the allergy vaccine 
ﬁ eld and to date is the only study of its type 
to achieve its primary efﬁ cacy endpoint.
After the ﬁ nancial year end we were delighted 
to learn that R301, a similar phase III trial 
with our Ragweed allergy vaccine, also met 
its primary efﬁ cacy endpoint which was 
particularly pleasing as this was the study 
most negatively affected by the FDA’s clinical 
hold which occurred in the middle of the 
treatment phase of this study. At the time 
of writing the data is still being assessed, 
but achieving a phase III clinical trial end-
point when fewer than 40% of the subjects 
were given the full four-shot treatment is 
very encouraging and speaks volumes for 
the efﬁ cacy of the Pollinex Quattro range. 
Variability characterises clinical trials in the 
ﬁ eld of allergy. The pollen seasons vary from 
country to country, area to area, and year 
to year. The patients recruited into studies 
vary. The subjective assessment of symptom 
scores by patients in the studies is prone to 
variation. The compliance of the subjects to 
the study protocols is geographically highly 
variable. During 2007, three other allergy 
vaccine products were in Phase III studies 
in the United States and all ‘failed’. One of 
these was a successful European product in 
the same allergen, in the same geography 
and even using some of the same study 
centres as G301. We are therefore very 
pleased that Pollinex Quattro has been 
successful in this most stringent of tests. 
One of the striking features of the G301 
outcome is the robustness of the result. All 
of the key prospectively deﬁ ned analyses 
are positive, showing a robust, clear and 
statistically signiﬁ cant beneﬁ t over placebo. 
Another feature, which bodes well for the 
future patient experience with Pollinex Quattro, 
is the unusually high levels of compliance; all 
but 5% of the patients completed the course 
of treatment. In most allergy vaccine studies, 
including those of sub-lingual products where 
the main proposed advantage is patient 
convenience, the compliance levels have been 
signiﬁ cantly worse and of course in real life, 
outside the controlled conditions of the clinical 
trial, compliance is likely to be poorer still. The 
excellent compliance with Pollinex Quattro is 
explained by the small number of injections, 
just four, and the speed of the treatment; it can 
be completed in as little as three weeks and as 
close as three weeks to the start of the pollen 
season. We believe that the result in terms 
of patients actually receiving the treatment 
as intended by their physicians will make 
ultra-short course injected allergy vaccines the 
treatment of choice for allergy specialists and 
their moderate to severe allergic patients. 
The G301 study will form the basis of a 
submission in early 2009 to the European 
authorities for the licensure of Pollinex Quattro 
Grass, with the ﬁ rst registration anticipated 
in or before 2010. The initial target market 
will be Germany, followed by Italy, Spain, 
UK and Austria, in each of which we have 
an existing commercial infrastructure, and 
France and the Netherlands. These seven 
countries represent the biggest commercial 
potential in Europe for the product.

05 Allergy Therapeutics plc Annual Report & Accounts 2008
was highlighted during the year in a report by 
the House of Lords Science and Technology 
Committee. Together with other stakeholders 
(professional groups, patient groups and 
companies), Allergy Therapeutics is supporting 
the National Allergy Strategy Group in its 
efforts to bring about an appropriate response 
from the Government to the House of Lords 
report, and to implement its recommendations. 
Success in this would mean that the UK for 
the fi rst time could have the professional 
infrastructure to treat sizeable numbers of 
British patients with allergy vaccines.
The three key characteristics of Pollinex 
Quattro, setting it apart from the competition, 
are ‘fast, strong, safe’. These characteristics 
are derived from the patented adjuvant MPL. 
The German marketing team has come up 
with a new ‘visual image’ to assist in the 
promotion of the product by focusing on 
these characteristics. After thorough market 
research to confi rm its effi cacy in promoting 
the key messages and having them retained 
by the prescribing physicians, Popeye was 
selected as the embodiment of ‘fast, strong, 
safe’. This innovative new campaign has 
been launched this season in Germany and 
the fi rst indications are that it is proving very 
effective. On a more subtle note, in April, 
Pollinex Quattro was awarded the 2008 
Biermann Pneumologie Preis for ‘outstanding 
therapy concepts in pulmonology’.
Our programme of constant improvement 
in Supply Operations continues to bear fruit, 
evidenced in the excellent service record last 
year. The Medicines and Healthcare products 
Regulatory Agency (‘MHRA’) conducted an 
inspection in February 2008, which passed 
very successfully with no major fi ndings. 
The ‘lean manufacturing’ initiative, which 
builds upon the investments made in plant 
and people to establish streamlined and 
effi cient processes, improving compliance, 
cutting costs and enhancing performance, 
has begun in earnest and benefi ts are 
already being felt across the business.
In summary, it has been a year of achievement 
after many years of investment and hard work 
by all involved. Allergy Therapeutics today 
has the fi rst ever clinically proven ultra-short 
course allergy vaccine and we are poised for 
submission for registration with the operational 
infrastructure being prepared to exploit it.

Our vision
– To generate and effectively utilise 
scientifi c and clinical information to 
maximise our Company potential 
and benefi t allergy sufferers.
– To ensure that all our work is 
conducted to the highest scientifi c 
and ethical standards for the benefi t 
of patients and shareholders.
“The excellent compliance with 
Pollinex Quattro is explained by 
the small number of injections, 
just four, and the speed of 
the treatment.”
Chief Executive’s Review
The planned European registrations will be 
supported by our heightened emphasis on 
the development and optimisation of our 
commercial operations in the key European 
markets. Our new management team in 
Germany enters its second year, and the 
focused projects they are implementing 
are gaining traction, with many of the 
operating key performance indicator targets 
being met on schedule and exceeded. Very 
experienced and energetic new General 
Managers have been appointed for both 
Italy and Spain, Nunzio di Grazia and 
Immaculada Abella Diez respectively, to 
continue and accelerate the optimisation of our 
commercial infrastructure in those markets. 
In the United Kingdom we have a small 
presence, refl ecting the small number of 
allergy specialists in the country. The issue 
of the poor provision of healthcare services 
to allergy sufferers in the United Kingdom

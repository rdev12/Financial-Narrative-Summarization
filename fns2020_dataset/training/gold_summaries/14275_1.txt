Strategic report
Chief Executive’s review
“ Three game-changing acquisitions during FY14 have transformed 
Sinclair. With approximately half its revenue derived from aesthetics 
and international, Sinclair is recognised both as a leader in facial 
rejuvenation and a presence in emerging dermatology markets.  
We expect revenue and profitability to accelerate this year driven  
by demand for our innovative products and supplemented by  
new product registrations and the potential to consolidate  
recently acquired distribution agreements”.
Sinclair generated £10.0m adjusted 
EBITDA
1
 for FY14 on sales of £63.6m. 
Like-for-like (‘LFL ’) revenues (excluding 
product disposals, one-off license income 
and currency fluctuations) grew by 4.4% 
with strong H2 LFL growth of 13.1% after 
the 7.5% LFL decline in H1. EBITDA was at 
the upper end of expectations after a strong 
performance in aesthetics further helped by 
better than expected initial contributions 
from the three aesthetic brands, Perfectha
®
, 
Ellansé™ and Silhouette
®
 all acquired 
during the second half. 
The creation of a highly differentiated, fast 
growing aesthetics portfolio enabled 
Sinclair to make important strategic and 
operational advances during the year, and 
aesthetics in FY14 represented one third of 
Group revenues. The rapid expansion of the 
Group’s aesthetic business in high volume 
growth markets and the ability to set price 
continues to drive operating margins with 
73% of revenues in the year from private 
pay products (2013: 62%). This combined 
with Sinclair’s fully integrated pan European 
structure resulted in increased operating 
leverage and a fifth successive increase in 
EBITDA margin
2
 to 16% during the financial 
year. 
Aesthetics and acquisitions 
Sinclair’s aesthetics strategy is centred on 
facial rejuvenation through collagen 
stimulation products which have amongst 
the highest growth rates in the dermal filler 
sector and so far account for around 10% 
of procedures in Sinclair’s key markets. HA 
fillers currently dominate the market and the 
acquisition of the Perfectha
®
 range of HA 
fillers in January 2014 was the first of three 
significant new brands added to Sinclair’s 
aesthetic portfolio in FY14, providing critical 
mass for the Group in aesthetics. 
Perfectha
®
 contributed revenues of £3.9m 
in the second half, compared with £2.4m 
for H2 FY13 pre-acquisition and was ahead 
of management expectations. 
Ellansé™ and Silhouette
®
, both next-
generation collagen stimulators, 
complement Sculptra
®
 and strongly 
enhance Sinclair’s competitive position in 
the global aesthetics market. Ellansé™, 
which provides immediate volumisation,  
and Silhouette
®
 a unique patented product 
giving an instant facelift have continued 
their recent rapid growth in emerging 
markets, particularly Asia, with Ellansé™ 
contributing £1.3m to Group revenues in its 
first three months and Silhouette
®
 £0.8m 
since it was acquired in May. Sculptra
®
 
made good progress during the year with 
LFL sales growth of 1 1% as a result of the 
extensive doctor training programme which 
continued throughout the year.

The integration of Perfectha
®
, Ellansé™ and 
Silhouette
®
 was completed quickly and 
necessitated a number of organisational 
changes to reflect the increasing scale  
of the Group’s activities. In addition 
improvements have already been made to 
optimise manufacturing processes and 
reduce costs. Both Perfectha
®
 and 
Ellansé™ distribution has been taken 
in-house across Europe together with 
Silhouette
®
 in the UK. Silhouette
®
 Russian 
rights are expected to be acquired in Q4 
2014 in-line with initial guidance. Multiple 
new hires across Sinclair’s pan European 
sales force preceded intensive pre-launch 
technical sales training on the new brands. 
Sinclair has created a very significant 
commercial opportunity in aesthetics,  
in particular its dominant position in the 
future of facial rejuvenation through 
collagen stimulation, and as a result  
it is the focus of the Group’s marketing 
resource. The Board has ambitions  
to create direct affiliates in leading 
aesthetic markets, notably Korea, the  
US and potentially Brazil. Contractual 
rights in Korea will likely facilitate such  
a move during FY15, while the timing  
of any US move will be dictated by 
regulatory timelines. 
The Group continues its policy of focusing 
its portfolio on a smaller number of 
dermatology brands. Disposals of Effederm 
and Xclair were made during the year for 
aggregate consideration of £1.0m, in 
excess of a 2x sales multiple.
Development 
Sinclair’s development strategy is to focus 
on line extensions and the geographical 
development of its existing brands. The 
acquisitions of Ellansé™ and Silhouette 
during the year provide significant scope in 
the US. Silhouette Lift
®
 is already approved 
in the US and it is hoped that Silhouette 
Instalift
®
 will be approved relatively quickly 
via a 510K submission to the FDA made in 
July 2014. US clinical trials for Ellansé™ are 
expected to commence in 2015, whilst in 
Europe Ellansé™ and Perfectha
®
 lidocaine 
formulations are timetabled for submission 
in Q2 2015. 
Flammacerium
®
 was granted orphan drug 
designation in March 2014 by the US FDA 
for the treatment of patients with severe 
dermal burns. Sinclair is optimistic to 
receive US approval in an accelerated 
timeframe as a result of the large body of 
existing clinical data. US approval would  
be expected to provide material upside to 
Sinclair’s earnings in future. 
Atlean
®
 is a combined collagen stimulator 
and HA filler for the treatment of the lower 
face and was acquired from GSK during 
the period. It has been off-market for 
around two years and re-registration is 
slated for Q2 2015. 
The development of Aloclair Ultra
®
, 
potentially the first twice-per-day mouth 
ulcer treatment is complete, with launch 
targeted for Q2 2015. 
Outlook 
Operational objectives for this year are 
focused on revenue and profit delivery. In 
Europe, the build-out of dedicated aesthetic 
sales and marketing operations is complete 
alongside the introduction of new sales 
force incentive schemes and intensive 
physician training programmes. Aesthetic 
brands are expected to make up over  
50% of Sinclair’s revenues in FY15 with 
significant growth anticipated in all regions. 
Sinclair has enjoyed a strong start to FY15 
with a step-up in growth and profitability 
driven by both the acquired brands and 
operating leverage.

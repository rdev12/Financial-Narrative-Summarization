Annual Report and Accounts 2013
Introduction
In the year ended 31 July 2013, we are pleased to report that 
Y ouGov has delivered a good financial performance, in line with the 
Board’s expectations. The Group’s revenue has once again grown 
well ahead of the global market research industry and we have 
also made further progress towards our stated goal of increasing 
our focus on real-time research based on our increasingly global 
online panel. Our profits and earnings per share have increased 
while we have continued to invest in developing our products 
and technologies as well as entering new markets. Given this 
performance, together with our continued robust financial position, 
the Board is recommending an increase of 20% in the dividend 
payable to shareholders.  
This year’s revenue of £62.6m was 8% higher than the prior year . 
Significantly , revenues in the second half year grew by 15%, 
compared to the same period in 2011/12, as we converted the 
strong sales reported at the interim stage. The Group’s adjusted 
operating profit increased by 7% to £6.0m, in line with its revenue 
growth. We continued to tighten our operating expense ratio, by 1 
percentage point, although gross margins fell slightly due to higher 
external data collection costs as more international off-panel work 
was conducted. Our adjusted profit before tax rose by 13% and 
adjusted earnings per share by 14% reflecting the strong operating 
performance and higher net finance income.   
Overview

1.  Adjusted operating profit is defined as group operating profit before amortisation of 
intangibles, impairment charge and exceptional items; in the year to 31 July 2013, 
amortisation of intangibles was £3.3m (2012: £4.4m) and exceptional costs were £1.2m 
(2012: £0.5m). Adjusted profit before tax and earnings per share are calculated based 
on the adjusted operating profit.

Overview Operating review Governance Additional information Financial statements
The success of our strategy of investing in faster growth from data 
products and services was reflected in revenue growth of 17% 
from this part of our business which now accounts for 24% of 
the Group’s total revenue. We are pleased to see these benefits 
resulting from our investments in new and enhanced products as 
well as in the people and technology with which to deliver them. 
Revenue from custom research increased overall by 5%, a growth 
rate which is in itself above the estimated global market growth rate 
of 3% for 2012/13. We believe that our innovations in breaking 
down the traditional divide between syndicated and custom 
research will enable Y ouGov to increase further the value that can 
be generated from the data that we collect as well as our business 
scalability . 
Given our diversified geographic footprint, different regions 
performed at varying speeds as expected.
The UK remains the territory where Y ouGov’s core business model 
is most developed. UK revenue increased by 11% to £17.4m 
reflecting significant new custom business wins among global 
corporate and institutional clients as well as continued growth in 
data products and services, especially for our market-leading 
Omnibus service. The higher revenue fed through to a 19% 
increase in its adjusted operating profits compared to the previous 
year , reflecting the scalability of the model. 
There was a mixed performance in the US which is our largest 
market by revenue. We achieved overall revenue growth of 8%, with 
BrandIndex continuing to grow strongly and our polling accuracy 
for the 2012 Presidential Election helping to increase awareness of 
our brand. However , US adjusted operating profit was £0.4m lower 
at £2.3m compared to £2.7m in the prior year . This was due to 
slower growth in the US custom research business in the second 
half of the year as two major clients unexpectedly reduced their 
activity . Following management actions, including cost savings, 
implemented since the year-end, we expect the US custom 
business and overall US profitability to be back on course in the 
current year .
The Middle East reported revenue growth of 22% and adjusted 
operating profit growth of 18%, both of which were well ahead of 
expectations due to continued new business wins in UAE and in 
the Kurdistan region of Iraq whose rapid economic development 
has created significant opportunities to exploit our research model 
along with our understanding of the region. In Germany , the 
progress reported at the interim stage was maintained resulting in 
higher profitability and the adjusted operating margin reaching 9%. 
Our Nordic unit, which as previously reported, experienced 
problems in the first half, has undergone a restructuring 
programme which started in January 2013, led by an interim CEO. 
This addressed the year-on-year revenue decline seen in the first 
half and led to cost reductions which will yield annualised savings 
of £0.5m. These actions should enable the unit to deliver a better 
performance in the next financial year . Our nascent French 
operation achieved its goal of doubling revenue from the previous 
year through several new BrandIndex contracts and a growing 
domestic and international Omnibus business. 
dividend
Following the payment of our maiden dividend of 0.5p per share 
in December 2012, the Board indicated that it intended to follow 
a progressive dividend policy in subsequent years. Having 
considered the Group’s performance in the year ended 31 July 
2013 and future expectations as well as its financial resources, the 
Board is pleased to recommend payment of a final dividend of 
0.6p per share in respect of the year ended 31 July 2013, payable 
in December 2013. This represents an increase of 20% over the 
maiden dividend paid in 2012.

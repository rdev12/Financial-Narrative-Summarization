2004 has been a year of significant
progress for the Group, with the
acquisition of six holiday parks
increasing our portfolio to 20 parks.
Like-for-like operating profit grew by
10.2% after allowing for the first year
winter costs at White Acres and Sea
Acres. The Group also relocated at the
beginning of the year to a new central
office in Newcastle upon Tyne and the
management team was strengthened
with the appointment of directors of
operations and human resources. 
Our management team have again
demonstrated their ability to grow
revenues and profits from the existing
estate whilst completing acquisitions and
a range of capital expenditure projects.
The Group remains focused upon the
domestic market and will continue to 
seek further growth opportunities in 
2005 and beyond. This growth will be
achieved by improving profitability in the
existing estate by capitalising on organic
growth opportunities, particularly beyond
2005, and by appropriate acquisitions.
The directors remain highly selective in
choosing acquisition targets and will only
acquire parks meeting our returns criteria.
Parkdean’s estate of 20 holiday parks
now covers 1,315 acres with a total of
9,189 pitches including 2,795 hire fleet
pitches, 5,104 private pitches and 1,290
touring pitches. This represents a 40%
increase over 2003. 
Holiday sales
Total revenue from holiday sales,
including income from touring, camping,
insurance and subletting of privately
owned caravans grew to £20.46m 
in 2004. Of this revenue, £0.55m 
came from the six parks acquired during
the year. Revenue from holiday sales
represented 33.9% of Group turnover
and a 46.4% share of total contribution
after direct wages and marketing costs. 
The core group of parks has performed
well in a highly competitive environment
with like-for-like holiday hire revenue at
the existing 14 parks in company owned
hire fleet of £16.45m, being 8.1% higher
than the previous year. This growth was
gained by a combination of higher
achieved tariff at peak season and
improved occupancy in the autumn 
driven by short breaks. 
We continue to focus on direct sales with
only 13.5% of our holiday hire revenue
sold via agents.
Parkdean occupies a unique position
within the UK holiday park market with 
in excess of one third of the caravan 
hire fleet in the existing parks being
double-glazed, centrally heated units.
Continued investment in this higher
specification of accommodation will help
to grow holiday tariff further in both the
spring and autumn and it is our intention
to invest in 68 double-glazed and
centrally heated units at the newly
acquired parks for 2005.
Touring revenue in the existing 14 parks
also grew by 7 .2% in 2004 to £1.75m,
underlining our successful investment 
in the touring facilities across the Group
in 2004. 
Sales of personal and car breakdown
insurance and cancellation cover of
£0.84m were 4.5% higher than the
previous year, a reflection of the slightly
higher number of holidays sold directly.
2005 will see the introduction of
regulations by the Financial Services
Authority (FSA) covering the sale and
administration of insurance products 
and Parkdean has been granted FSA
approval to operate in this area.

Caravan sales
Caravan sales continued to be buoyant 
in 2004, with turnover of £18.19m
achieved, 30.1% of the Group’s turnover.
£1.34m came from the six parks acquired
during the financial year. Caravan sales
provided a 14.3% share of the total
contribution after direct wages and
marketing costs.
During the course of the year, caravan
sales were successfully introduced at
Ruda in Devon for the first time with the
sale of 20 units. The Company also
continued to develop additional pitches 
at Newquay where a total of 53 units
were sold during the year. Turnover at 
the existing parks grew by 14.2% to
£16.85m in 2004. 
Caravan sales opportunities at White
Acres, Sea Acres, Crantock Beach,
Holywell Bay and Torquay remain under
review – all pitches on these parks are
currently used for holiday hire or touring.
The Group has gained planning consent
at St Minver for a development of 32
lodges and these pitches will be
developed for the 2005 season with
some being available for private sale. 
The progress of this development will 
be reviewed with a view to introducing
the sale of lodges at other parks in the
future. All caravans and lodges sold 
by Parkdean are for holiday use only.
Owner income
Owner income of £6.80m was 
achieved last year, representing 11.3% 
of turnover and a 17 .7% share of the 
total contribution after direct wages 
and marketing costs. £0.44m of this
revenue came from the six newly acquired
parks. The Group now has in excess of
5,000 owners providing a robust and
transparent income stream for the Group.
The Group is introducing our “Owners
Select” service across the expanded
estate for the 2005 season providing
improved information and service to 
our holiday homeowners.  Retail
Retail income totalled £14.92m in 2004,
a 24.7% share of turnover and a 21.6%
share of the total contribution post direct
wages and marketing. Retail income at
the six newly acquired parks was £0.90m
in 2004.
The Directors are particularly pleased 
with the growth in revenue in the 
Group’s bars and food areas targeted 
for improvement in 2004. Revenue grew
by 7 .0% over 2004 in the bars at the
existing 14 parks and margin after wages
grew by 8.1%. Food sales grew by 9.6%
although the achieved margin after wages
remained flat as a better value offering
was promoted to increase daytime 
use of facilities and improve customer
satisfaction. The Group’s management
team have been particularly focused 
on improving the quality of our food 
and beverage product in 2004; the
provision of strong on-park retail and
leisure offering is a core element of 
our overall holiday product.
On-park revenue from other areas of 
the business, including sports activities,
amusements and membership fees were
at a similar level to the previous year on 
a like-for-like basis. 
The outlook for 2005
The Group’s capital expenditure plans
focus upon the replacement of 274
holiday hire caravans, 136 of which 
will be double-glazed with either warm 
air or central heating. The Group will be
spending £1.3m on “catch-up” capital
expenditure on the six newly acquired
parks, mainly on upgrading infrastructure.
32 new lodge pitches will be developed
at St Minver as outlined earlier and
£0.55m will be invested in further
upgrading our financial and holiday
booking systems to better manage the
enlarged Group. Total capital expenditure
for 2005 is anticipated to be £10m, 
a similar level to 2004, albeit across 
a larger Group.
Parkdean’s holiday brochure featuring 
all 20 parks has now been distributed 
to the 480,000 enquirers and customers
on our database. This brochure has been
distributed later than in previous years
due to our desire to include the recently
acquired parks. This conscious decision
has resulted in an anticipated lag in
bookings from our database. Booking
patterns since the return to work after 
the Christmas and New Y ear break,
demonstrate a sufficient level of holiday
demand to recover this shortfall in the 
first quarter.
The Directors are pleased with the
integration of the six parks acquired
during the year and the enthusiasm of 
the management and staff. Substantial
progress has been made on this winter’s
capital expenditure programme, with
many of the Group’s new hire fleet now
being in situ at our parks. 2005 has an
early Easter and the board are pleased
with the progress across the Group 
in preparing for the coming season.

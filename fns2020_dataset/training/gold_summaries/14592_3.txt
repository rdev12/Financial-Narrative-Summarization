Spectris plc Annual report and accounts 2008
Chairman’s Statement
John Hughes, Chairman
Introduction
Spectris achieved a good performance in 2008, in spite of an 
economic environment which deteriorated during the second 
half of the year. Sales for the full year increased by 19% to  
£787.1 million compared with £659.8 million in 2007*. On  
a constant currency basis, sales increased by 7%, of which 
approximately 4% was from acquisitions. 
Operating profit increased by 13% to £118.3 million (2007: 
£104.3 million). On a constant currency basis, operating profit 
increased by 2%, of which approximately 3% was from 
acquisitions. Operating margins were 15.0%, compared with 
15.8% in the prior year. Increased expenditure on research  
and development led to a reduction of 0.4 percentage points  
(pp) in operating margins, acquisitions resulted in a reduction 
of 0.2pp and the dilutive effect of foreign exchange reduced 
margins by 0.1pp. Profit before tax increased by 12% to  
£110.1 million (2007: £98.0 million) and earnings per share 
increased by 25% to 72.8 pence (2007: 58.1 pence). The effective 
tax rate reduced by 4pp to 24%, as a result of a tax-efficient 
inter-company financing structure and the recognition of tax 
losses brought forward in the UK.
Cash conversion was strong, with 86% of operating profit 
converted to operating cash. Capital investment was in excess  
of depreciation due to investment in a new technical centre for 
one of our businesses in the UK and investment in IT system 
upgrades. Net debt at the end of the period was £162.1 million, 
compared with £77.3 million at the end of December 2007. The 
increase is due to the cost of acquisitions, capital expenditure 
and the weakening of sterling. Net interest costs were  
£8.2 million, giving an annualised cover of 14.4 times.
The group’s financial position is strong. At 31 December 2008, 
the group had cash of £64 million, committed facilities of 
£257 million (of which £217 million was utilised), and 
uncommitted facilities of £41 million (of which £10 million  
was utilised). Since the year end, an additional £50 million, 
five-year loan facility has been secured.
“ The group is in a strong financial and 
strategic position and we consider that the 
actions we are taking are appropriate in the 
near term whilst retaining in our businesses 
the resources to support growth as market 
demand recovers.”
*  Two businesses were divested in 2007. In order to aid understanding of the 
results for the ongoing business, references in the Chairman’s Statement, Chief 
Executive’s Statement, Operating Review and Financial Review to the sales and 
operating profit results in the 2007 comparatives exclude the results of these 
two businesses. Unless otherwise stated, figures for operating profit, profit 
before tax and earnings per share are adjusted measures – for explanation of 
adjusted figures and reconciliation to the statutory reported figures see Note 3. 03

Financial highlights
The Board proposes to pay a final dividend of 17.0 pence which, 
combined with the interim dividend of 6.4 pence, gives a total  
of 23.4 pence (2007: 21.0 pence), an increase of 11%. The dividend 
will be paid on 26 June 2009 to shareholders on the register on  
5 June 2009.
Outlook
The current market conditions continue to be challenging and  
offer very limited visibility. We have taken, and continue to take, 
timely actions to reduce operating costs and, should the outlook 
deteriorate further, we will not hesitate to take additional steps. As 
a result of the phasing of restructuring costs and their associated 
benefits, the balance between first and second half year profitability 
is expected to be materially different from past years. The group is 
in a strong financial and strategic position and we consider that  
the actions we are taking are appropriate in the near term whilst 
retaining in our businesses the resources to support growth as 
market demand recovers.

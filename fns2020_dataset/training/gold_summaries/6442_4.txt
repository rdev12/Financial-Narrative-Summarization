 02 Gaming Realms plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2014
Gaming Realms is exploiting two major industry 
trends. Firstly; the much talked about switch by 
consumers to mobile devices and secondly; the 
increasing use of features derived from social 
games designed to increase player lifetime  
and revenues. 
The Group has built its own platform and is showing 
up to 68% of players using mobile and tablet 
devices. The existing gambling industry has been 
slow to adapt to this change, with research showing 
historic use of mobile at only 17%. With this 
strategy the business hopes to expand the current 
1.73m online UK slot market into the relatively 
untouched 12m adult UK social games market.*

Our Brands
Real money Gambling
This is operated by Bear Group  
on our new in-house platform.  
The leading brands are SpinGenie 
and PocketFruity, which are both 
casinos targeted at the UK casual 
gambling market. The platform 
has been built for mobile and web 
and we are seeing over three 
times more sessions on mobile 
than desktop. SpinGenie also has 
social levels which are used to 
appeal to a more female, casual 
audience. The levels create 
enhanced engagement for the 
players on the site. 
White label Bingo
QTM and BBH market ten white 
label bingo sites, most notably 
Iceland Bingo, Diva Bingo and 
LuckyCharm Bingo. We use the 
multiple sites in order to increase 
player acquisition and increase 
retention among the portfolio  
of brands.

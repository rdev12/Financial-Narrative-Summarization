 WINNING MOMENTS 24 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2007-2008 25
   FINANCIAL REVIEW
This is the first year under which 
Sportingbet has adopted International 
Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) 
as the basis to report its financial results, 
as opposed to UK GAAP .  As a result of 
the implementation of IFRS, terminology 
used in the presentation of the financial 
results has changed. Precise definitions of 
the new terms used are included in Note 
1 on Accounting Policies. A reconciliation 
between the results under IFRS and UK 
GAAP is set out in Note 27.
T rading summary
Amounts wagered (previously disclosed as 
turnover) for the year ended 31 July 2008 
were £1,364.2m (2007: £1,096.4m), earning 
net gaming revenue “NGR” (previously 
disclosed as gross profit) of £147.0m  
(2007: £119.4m). 
Amounts wagered on sports betting in 
Europe grew by 27.5% to £764.9m (2007: 
£599.8m), earning NGR of £71.1m (2007: 
£49.7m). Casino and gaming contributed 
a further £36.8m, and poker £20.0m, to 
both amounts wagered and NGR (2007: 
£29.4m and £27.9m). Amounts wagered on 
Australian sports betting grew by 23.5% to 
£542.5m (2007: £439.3m), earning NGR of 
£19.1m (2007: £12.4m).  
As a percentage of amounts wagered, the 
European and Australian sports NGR were 
9.3% and 3.5% respectively (2007: 8.3% 
and 2.8%). However, amounts wagered 
and NGR are stated after a deduction for 
customer bonuses of £13.5m (2007: £7.9m). 
Without the bonus deduction the equivalent 
numbers would have been 10.1% and 3.7% 
(2007: 9.0% and 2.9%). The increase in 
customer bonuses from £7.9m to £13.5m 
during the year reflects the bringing in-house 
of certain marketing partners together with 
an increased focus on customer retention 
and driving customer yields. 
Costs (excluding exceptional items, share 
option charge and amortisation) in the  
year were £124.3m (2007 restated: 
£114.5m), accounting for 84.6% of NGR 
(2007 restated: 95.9%).
Operating profit (before exceptional items, 
share option charge and amortisation) for 
the year is marginally better than expected 
at £22.7m (2007 restated: £4.9m). The 
Group benefited from the inclusion in 
the year of Euro 2008, which contributed 
£20.2m of additional amounts wagered, 
generating £2.0m of NGR. Historically these 
tournaments tend to deliver a lower than 
average margin for bookmakers. Euro 2008, 
however delivered approximately £1.0m 
more of NGR than our original expectations.
Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation 
and amortisation (excluding exceptional 
items and share option charge) was up 
145.4% to £29.2m (2007 restated: £11.9m).
Operating loss after charging exceptional 
items of £12.0m (2007: £26.8m), share 
option charge of £8.0m (2007: £9.9m) and 
amortisation of other intangible assets of 
£3.9m (2007: £1.8m), was £1.2m (2007 
restated: 33.6m).
Finance income
Finance income comprised interest 
receivable of £0.8m (2007: £1.2m) and 
interest payable on bank loans of £0.4m 
(2007: £0.2m).
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share before exceptional 
items, share option charge and amortisation 
was 4.3p (2007 restated: 1.2p). Diluted 
earnings per share before exceptional items, 
share option charge and amortisation was 
3.8p (2007 restated: 1.1p).
Cash Flow
During the year ended 31 July 2008, the 
Group generated cash from operating 
activities of £33.0m (2007 restated: £0.1m).  
As at 31 July 2008, the Group had £49.4m 
(2007 restated: £34.5m) of cash and liquid 
resources on its balance sheet, of which 
£15.2m (2007: £12.9m) related to  
customer liabilities.
Gross financial liabilities amounted to 
£10.1m (2007: £5.4m) which comprised 
£5.6m (2007: £5.3m) bank loans secured on 
residential properties in the Channel Islands, 
£4.5m (2007: £nil) contingent consideration 
following the acquisition of the business and 
assets of Belmond International Limited and 
£nil (2007: £0.1m) contingent consideration 
relating to the acquisition of Sportingbet 
Italia S.p.A.
T reasury management
The Group’s treasury function provides 
a centralised service for the provision of 
finance and the management and control 
of liquidity, foreign exchange and interest 
rates. The function operates as a cost centre 
and manages the Group’s treasury exposure 
to reduce risk in accordance with policies 
approved by the Board.
It is not the policy of the Group to trade 
in or enter into speculative transactions. 
Authorities, procedures and reporting 
responsibilities are documented and 
regularly reviewed. 
Due to the international nature of its core 
activities, the Group’s reported profits, net 
assets and cash flows are all affected by 
foreign exchange rate movements. 
Operations are financed by a mixture of 
retained profits, bank borrowings and long-
term loans. In addition, various financial 
instruments, such as trade receivables 
and trade payables, arise directly from the 
Group’s operations.
Certain customers in the Australian region 
are allowed to place bets on credit. The 
Group’s policy in respect of credit risk is to 
require appropriate credit checks are made 
on potential customers before bets are 
placed and credit limits set accordingly.

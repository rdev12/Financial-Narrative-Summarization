Commenting on the results, Hassan Sadiq, Chief Executive, said:
I am delighted with The Innovation Group’s performance in 2006. We increased
revenue by 31% and 70% of our total revenue is now recurring. During the year we
built the business through organic growth and via selective acquisitions, culminating
in the recently announced acquisition of First Notice Systems, securing critical mass
in the important US market. The current year has started encouragingly with two UK
software wins and several new outsourcing contracts. The Group is well positioned
for 2007.

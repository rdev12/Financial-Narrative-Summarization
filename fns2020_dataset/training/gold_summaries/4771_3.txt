 Results
I am pleased to report that Dignity has continued its track
record of strong profit growth.
Underlying operating profits have increased by 8 per cent 
to £61.0 million (2009: £56.4 million). Underlying earnings
per share have increased 15 per cent to 46.4 pence per
Ordinary Share (2009: 40.5 pence per Ordinary Share).
Dividends
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 8.88 pence per
Ordinary Share to be paid on 24 June 2011 to members 
on the register at close of business on 27 May 2011. This
dividend is subject to the approval of shareholders at the
Annual General Meeting on 9 June 2011. This final dividend
represents a 10 per cent increase on the equivalent dividend
paid in the previous year.
This will be the only dividend paid in respect of profits
generated in 2010, as an interim dividend was not paid
separately, but was instead included within the £1 Return 
of Value per Ordinary Share paid in October 2010.
New Secured Notes and Return of Value
In the second half of the year, the Group issued further
Secured Notes, raising gross proceeds of £87.1 million. 
The majority of the proceeds were returned to shareholders.
This demonstrates the Group’s continued ability to leverage
its stable cash flows for the benefit of its shareholders by
replacing relatively expensive equity with cheaper debt that
also benefits from a tax deduction.
The Board
There were no changes to the Board in the year and I am
pleased that Ishbel Macpherson and Alan McWalter have
both agreed to remain Non-Executive Directors until the 
end of 2012 to serve alongside James Newman and Bill
Forrester. I have also signed a new contract for a further
three year period. I will therefore, remain Chairman until
December 2013.
I would like to thank all my fellow Directors for their support
during another successful year.
Our people
This business continues to set client service excellence 
as a key objective. Once again, 98 per cent of families
would recommend our services and 99 per cent said we
either met or exceeded their expectations. This is due to the
continued dedication of our staff across the entire business
and I thank them for the roles they have each played during
the year.
I am delighted that as a Group, we continue to invest heavily
to support our staff by keeping open our defined benefit
pension scheme, through training, a generous staff sick pay
scheme, awards for long service and grants for personal
development via the Welfare Trust. In return, we have loyal
staff, with more than half having worked for the Group for
over five years, who are all dedicated to helping our clients
every step of the way.
Outlook for 2011
The year has started well in all three divisions of our
business and the Board remains confident in the 
Group’s prospects.

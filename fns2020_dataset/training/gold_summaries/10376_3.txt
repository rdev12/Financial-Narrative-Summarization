Chairman’s statement
Since our foundation in 2003 the 
Board has had an absolute commitment 
to the creation and delivery of value to
shareholders whether through organic
growth, investment in the business for
high returns, the pursuit of value creative
acquisitions, or a return to shareholders 
by way of dividends and share buybacks. 
With this guiding principle in mind, and
recognising that a consistently higher
valuation is placed by property investors
on our estate than is valued within the
current integrated model, the Board has
been investigating options for capturing
the value of the property estate for
shareholders on a sustainable basis. 
To that end, after a competitive process,
substantial progress was made in the
summer on negotiating a joint venture
transaction with R20 (the investment
vehicle of Robert Tchenguiz). In the 
final stage of this transaction, we entered
into hedging agreements which were a
fundamental bank requirement to secure
the necessary financing arrangements 
for the joint venture and to achieve
appropriate ratings from ratings agencies.
However, the sudden and unprecedented
collapse of world debt markets rendered
the joint venture undeliverable but 
left the hedging arrangements in place.
Driven by a most unusual mix of inflation
and interest rate expectations, combined 
with limited liquidity, the cost of the
Mitchells & Butlers’ results this year reflect
a strong financial performance and we are
pleased with the operational development
across the business. The executive team
has been particularly effective in growing
sales and profits despite some significant
economic and cost challenges, whilst also
rapidly implementing the conversion of
the high quality Whitbread sites acquired
in July 2006. We have extended our
leadership of the eating-out market
serving 107 million meals and generated
significant drinks market share gains. 
As a result, revenues have risen by 10%,
operating profits by 11% and earnings per
share before exceptional items by 21%.
This performance has enabled the Board
to recommend a final dividend payment
of 10.0p per share, taking the total
ordinary dividend for the year to 14.25p,
an increase of 16.3%. This payment is
additional to the Special Dividend of
£486m paid to shareholders in October
2006 and reflects the strong growth 
in earnings per share, as well as our
commitment to a progressive policy 
for dividends.

hedges at the year-end, although not 
a cash item, had risen to £155m after tax.
The hedging arrangements have been
retained as the Board remains committed
to a property-based refinancing which
would utilise them, once debt markets
have recovered. The Board will continue
to balance the assessment of risk with
potential reward of this policy.
Whilst the Board’s focus has been on the
establishment of a property joint venture,
alternative property based refinancing
structures remain under consideration. 
In this context, the board has received 
a proposal from R20 in respect of a
demerged Real Estate Investment Trust
(‘REIT’) structure, which includes R20
procuring a fixed price underwriting for
in the region of 25% of the REIT equity.
The attractiveness and feasibility of this
proposal is being explored. A REIT
structure would have to meet the Board’s
requirement for an appropriate balance 
to optimise the value of both demerged
companies as independent entities.
The Board will continue to review
alternative structures that would
demonstrably create value from the
property, whilst providing an attractive
long term business model for the
operating company.
In view of the focus on Mitchells &
Butlers’ real estate, we considered it was
important to establish a current value of
our freehold and long leasehold properties
and we requested Colliers CRE to update
our valuation as at 29 September 2007.
The revised value of the estate in our
books at £5bn represents a net increase 
of £1.1bn compared to the historical
accounting basis and provides a solid 
and up to date foundation for judging 
the asset strength of the Group 
in turbulent times.
Because pubs are specific use assets, 
it is the operational success of the business
which has been the primary factor in
growing the value of our freehold property
and which has also enabled us to return
over £1.1bn in cash to shareholders 
since demerger in 2003, over and above
ordinary dividends. This performance 
has been driven by our operational teams,
who I believe are collectively the best in
the industry. I would like to thank them 
all for their perseverance, flexibility and
hard work during the year.
There has been one change to the 
Board announced during the second half
of the year. Tony Hughes, 59, stepped
down as Managing Director, Restaurants
on 1 October 2007 since when he has
been assisting in the handover of his role
and the further development of food
capabilities in the business. He will retire
from the Board of the Company on 
31 December 2007. He is succeeded 
by Adam Fowle, previously Managing
Director for the Acquired Sites and
Business Development. Adam has some 
20 years experience in licensed retailing,
having joined Mitchells & Butlers in 1985.
He was previously Managing Director 
of the Pubs & Bars division, becoming 
a Retail Director at Sainsbury’s for two
years. He rejoined Mitchells & Butlers 
in 2005.
I welcome Adam to the Board and would
like to thank Tony for his exceptional
contribution to the Company over the last
12 years. His vision and drive have been
instrumental in the development of our
highly successful pub restaurant brands. 
I wish him every happiness in his
retirement.
Looking forward, 2008 will undoubtedly
be a more challenging year, with the
uncertain outlook for consumer
confidence and the first year of the
smoking ban. However, I am confident
that a clear management strategy for
competitive out-performance based on
high quality brands, excellent sites and
strong operating skills will underpin the
continuing progress of the Company.

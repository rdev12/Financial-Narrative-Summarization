In my first statement as Chairman, I am
pleased to report another strong performance
by the group during 2002. Against a
challenging economic background our core
UK ports business has once again performed
satisfactorily, producing 3 per cent growth in
underlying operating profit from continuing
operations. This performance is reflected in our
financial results, with underlying pre-tax profit up 
6 per cent to £138.1 million (2001: £130.4 million).
Underlying earnings per share increased by 8 per
cent to 30.4 pence per share (2001: 28.1 pence
per share), benefiting from both the strong
operating results and a reduction in the weighted
average number of shares following the previous
year’s share repurchase programme.
Results
The group’s ports and transport business
continued to grow in 2002, contributing £142.9
million to operating profit from continuing
operations, an increase of 4 per cent on 2001
(£137.6 million). As anticipated, as a result of the
programme of non-core property sales, lower
rental income reduced the profit from property
investment to £6.8 million (2001: £8.0 million).
There was also a reduction in profit from property
development, which contributed £12.0 million
(2001: £13.0 million). The contribution from the
group’s associated companies, however, showed
an increase to £10.5 million (2001: £8.5 million),
reflecting strong performances from our interests
in two container-handling businesses,
Southampton Container Terminals and Tilbury
Container Services. The disposal of non-core
investment properties provided an additional profit
of £0.7 million (2001: £0.6 million) and goodwill
amortisation at £1.6 million was similar to the
previous year’s charge (2001: £1.5 million). In
addition, the group realised an exceptional profit
of £7.4 million, following the sale of AMPORTS
USA’s Aviation division. This was offset, to a large
extent, by a £5.5 million restructuring charge
resulting from a review of the group’s cost base.
We estimate that this review will save the group 
at least £3.0 million per year once the programme
of cost savings is fully implemented. Comparative
figures for 2001 have been restated for the effects
of Financial Reporting Standard 19 – Deferred
Tax, which the group adopted during the year.
Business highlights
The core ports and transport business
continued to benefit from our strategy of growing
the business with existing and new customers.
Our rigorously-targeted capital investment
programme continued to generate further growth-
producing projects. Highlights for the year
included a new £5.6 million rail siding for Humber
International Terminal at Immingham, the new
£4.0 million Southampton International Vehicle
Terminal and a new £3.1 million Hyundai vehicle-
processing facility at Baltimore in Maryland, USA.
We are investing £8.5 million in passenger-
terminal improvements at Southampton and
developing a £1.5 million third cruise terminal
there. We also reached agreement in principle for
a new £4.6 million timber terminal for Saint-
Gobain Building Distribution at Newport and the
Port of Teignmouth will benefit from a £4.0 million
redevelopment.
The public inquiry into our application to
develop a new six-berth container port at Dibden,
opposite the Port of Southampton, concluded in
Dividend per share
00 12.75p
01 13.75p
02 14.75p 11 11
December 2002. We are convinced of the need
for additional deep-sea container capacity in the
UK and remain committed to developing this
facility. The government’s decision is now expected
either in late 2003 or 2004.
Our strategy of disposing of non-core assets
continues. As well as the US$50.0 million sale of
the Aviation division of our US operations, we sold
a further £31.0 million of property and land during
the year. Sales of non-core assets since 1 January
2000 total £272.0 million.
Dividend
The directors are recommending a final dividend
of 8.25 pence per share (2001: 7.75 pence per
share), which makes a total of 14.75 pence per
share for 2002 (2001: 13.75 pence per share). If
approved by shareholders, the final dividend will
be paid on 1 May 2003 to shareholders who are
on the register at 4 April 2003.
Board of directors
Sir Keith Stuart retired from the board on 
16 April 2002, having been Chairman since 1982
and Managing Director of the British Transport
Docks Board, Associated British Ports’
predecessor, from 1976. Sir Keith made a very
significant contribution to the group over many
years. He led the company’s successful
privatisation – one of the most successful in the
UK – in 1983 and played a major role in the reform
of industrial relations at the ports. The board and 
I wish him well.
George Duncan, non-executive Deputy
Chairman, will retire from the board at the Annual
General Meeting on 15 April 2003. He has served
the company as a non-executive director for 17
years, during which time the group has benefited
greatly from his considerable boardroom
experience. 
Stuart Chambers, group chief executive of
Pilkington plc, one of the world’s leading glass
manufacturers, became a non-executive director
on 15 October 2002. I am confident that Stuart’s
wealth of industrial experience will enable him to
make an excellent contribution to the board.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank
everyone across the group for their continuing
efforts. Our strong results would not have been
possible without their hard work.
Prospects
While the general economic climate remains
uncertain, group performance so far in 2003 has
been satisfactory. The group’s UK ports business
has the advantage of many long-term contracts
with quality customers. These agreements, together
with the group’ s strong cash flow and diverse spread
of geographical and cargo risk, lead us to remain
confident of making further progress in 2003.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
We report a single remuneration figure for executive directors which 
includes salary, annual performance-related bonus, long term incentive 
bonus and other benefits.

£’000
2014 
£’000
Group Chief Executive David Brown 2,163 1,960
Group Finance Director Keith Down 1,265 1,299
A large proportion of the executive directors’ remuneration is payable in 
shares. Half of the total annual performance-related bonus is awarded as 
deferred shares, to be held for a period of three years and subject to 
recovery and withholding provisions. Awards under the long term incentive 
plan (LTIP) are also made in shares, which further aligns the interests of  
our executive directors with those of our shareholders. A substantial part 
of executive directors’ remuneration is performance-related and linked to 
key performance indicators. The remuneration committee’s unanimous 
view was that the Group’s performance supported the executive directors’ 
remuneration this year. Overall operating profit rose 11.1% in the year  
to 27 June 2015 and the Group’s share price rose 13.9%. Over the three 
year period to the same date, the share price increase was 124.1%.
The remuneration above includes the vesting of the LTIP award from  
2012, which has rewarded the successful implementation of long term  
value strategic targets set three years ago.
For the next tranche of LTIP awards in November 2015, we are  
proposing a customer satisfaction measure recognising that providing  
high levels of customer service is fundamental to our success.

1. Reduction since our 2007/08 baseline, calculated using conversion factors provided annually by the Government.
TOTAL REVENUE (£m) 
£3,215.2m
Group revenue rose £512.8m, or 19.0%, in the year 
with growth in all divisions. 14.6% of the increase 
is attributable to the introduction of the GTR rail 
franchise in September 2014. 
TOTAL OPERATING PROFIT (£m)
£114.7m +11.1% +19.0%
Group operating profit increased by £11.5m, or 
11.1%, ahead of the Board’s initial expectations. This 
strong performance was driven by our rail division. 
We refer to operating profit excluding the impact 
of one off charges and credits to show a clearer 
trend. Our operating profit after exceptional items 
and amortisation was £96.8m (2014: £109.5m).
ADJUSTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (p)
150.8p +1.5%
Adjusted earnings per share (3ps) rose by 2.2p, 
or 1.5%, reflecting increasing operating profit and 
taking the non-controlling interest in our rail division  
into account.
We use adjusted eps as a KPI as it excludes the 
impact of one off charges or credits in any year to 
provide a clearer trend. Our basic eps was 121.6p, 
down 25.9% due to the impact of exceptional costs in 
2015 and an exceptional credit in 2014 (see note 7).

Further to a 4.3% increase in the interim dividend, 
the Board is pleased to propose a final dividend 
of 63.4p per share (2014: 59.0p), increasing the full 
year dividend to 90.0p (2014: 84.5p), up 5.5p  
or 6.5%. 
Y ear on year performance in this metric declined, 
largely due to the introduction of the GTR rail 
franchise, which has higher than Group average 
CO 2 emissions per passenger journey. Compared 
to our 2007/08 baseline data, overall Group CO 2 
emissions per passenger journey have improved 
9.3%, On a like for like basis, removing the impact 
of bus acquisitions and new rail franchises, since 
2007/08 the improvement is 15.9% against the 
same baseline year.

Our regional bus passenger satisfaction scores 
remain industry leading. The overall score in our 
rail division declined in the year, impacted by the 
significant infrastructure improvements taking  
place as part of the Government’s £6.5bn 
Thameslink Programme.

 CHIEF  
EXECUTIVE’S 
STATEMENT
Overview
I am pleased to announce an excellent set of results, 
delivered in a challenging global economic environment.  
Our diversification strategy over the past four years to 
reduce the group’s dependency on the London office 
sector has paid off and demonstrated the robustness of 
ISG’s businesses.
We have continued to expand our service offering and now 
offer:
fit out and project management services to •	
customers in many of the major European, Middle 
Eastern and Asian cities;
fit out, refurbishment and new build services to food •	
retail, retail banking and retail fashion clients nationally 
across the UK; and
new build and refurbishment services to public and •	
private sector clients across England and South 
Wales.
In addition, whilst maintaining our leading market position 
in the office sector, we have broadened our offering in 
the London market where we offer fit out, new build and 
refurbishment services to include both the public and 
private sectors.
This has enabled the group to offset the decline in the UK 
and Western European office sectors by our exposure to 
more resilient sectors such as food retail, retail banking, 
technology and public sector projects as well as our 
increased exposure to the Asian markets.

7 Results
For the year ended 30 June 2009, adjusted profit before 
tax

that decreased by 4% to £1,049m (2008 - £1,090m).  
Adjusted earnings per share
2

(2008 - 36.22p).
Net cash as at 30 June 2009 of £32.1m was slightly behind

Dividends
An interim dividend of 4.00p was paid in April 2009.  The 
Board has decided to increase by 5% the level of final 
dividend.  Hence a final dividend of 9.66p is proposed

increase of 3.5%.  Subject to shareholder approval at 
the AGM on 4 December 2009, the final dividend will

 and order 
book for each of the group’s business segments.
The recent series of economic and political events in the 
world have had an impact on our business with many of 
our corporate clients becoming more cautious in their 
decision making in the last quarter of calendar year 2008 
and the first quarter of 2009, leading to some projects 
being delayed or cancelled.  
With group revenue decreasing in the year by 4%, adjusted 
group operating profit
1
 decreased by 8% to £13.9m (2008 
- £15.1m) resulting in an operating margin on revenue of 
1 .3% (2008 - 1 .4%).
In London, revenue declined by 33% to £380m, resulting 
in operating profits falling to £5.3m (2008 - £7 .9m).  London 
now represents 31% (2008 - 43%) of group trading 
operating profit.  The operating profit of our Regional 
Construction businesses increased to £3.0m (2008 - 
£2.3m) resulting from a 22% increase in revenue, and now 
represents 17% (2008 - 12%) of group trading operating 
profit and includes a full year’s contribution from Pearce 
Construction (2008 - seven and a half months).

9 Our Retail operations generated operating profits of £6.7m 
(2008 - £3.9m) resulting from a 52% increase in revenue 
and now represents 38% (2008 - 21%) of group trading 
operating profit and includes a full year’s contribution from 
Pearce Retail (2008 - seven and a half months). 
Our Asia operations generated operating profits of £2.1m 
(2008 - £1 .7m) resulting from a 24% increase in revenue 
and now represents 12% (2008 - 9%) of group trading 
operating profit.  Our Middle East operations generated 
an operating loss of £0.4m (2008 - nil) as we invested in 
the start up of these operations.  Our European operations 
generated operating profits of £1 .4m (2008 - £3.1m), with 
the decline due to the substantial reduction in revenue in 
the second half of the year caused by the economic crisis.
In respect of the order book of £822m at the end of June 
2009, only 26% of the activity relates to the corporate 
office sector (2008 - 36%) with 37% relating to education, 
affordable housing and government sectors (2008 - 34%) 
and 27% to the retail and leisure sector (2008 - 25%).
london
In our Annual Report for 2008, we anticipated a slow down 
in the office market and reduced the volume target for our 
London businesses in the financial year by 20%.  With the 
severity of the credit crunch particularly on commercial 
developer clients, volumes in the year declined by 24% 
to £448m (2008 - £588m) and revenue by 33% to £380m 
(2008 - £569m).  Operating profit decreased by 34% to 
£5.3m (2008 - £7 .9m) resulting in an operating margin 
on revenue of 1 .4% (2008 - 1 .4%).  With the anticipated 
decline in volumes we have been actively managing the 
level of our resources.
london Fit out

 have declined 29% to £218m 
(2008 - £309m).  Notable project delivery successes were 
the completion of the new London offices for Mayer Brown 
International, Reed Smith, Standard Bank and the Financial 
Services Authority, new offices for Unilever in Leatherhead, 
the third phase of the refit of Shell House on the South 
Bank and a £75m data centre fit out for EDS.  In addition, 
we have also been working on the pre-construction phase 
of the circa £60m fit out of KPMG’s new UK headquarters 
building in Canary Wharf, which started on site in May 
2009.  
The business has an order book of £159m as at June 
2009 (2008 - £174m), of which £137m is to be delivered 
in the current financial year (2008 - £102m).  Since the 
year end the business has been awarded eleven projects 
in the residential, technology and office sectors with a 
total value of £68m, of which £40m is for delivery in the 
current financial year.  In the last few months we have

11 noted tentative signs of improvement in the pipeline of 
major fit out opportunities, with the pipeline of contracts 
we expect to tender in the next six months increasing over 
the previous six months.  We have seen also some signs 
of improvement in the smaller end of the market albeit it 
continues to be highly competitive.  As such we anticipate 
volumes being maintained in the current financial year.  
london Build
As expected, revenue in London Build has declined by 13% 
to £227m (2008 - £260m) due to the reduced demand for 
new build and refurbishment of office space in Greater 
London.  In the year we completed several projects for 
commercial developers including the Stratton Street 
project for Grafton Advisors, the Fleetway House scheme 
for Tishman Speyer, 107 Cheapside for Carlyle Group and 
the Savannah House scheme for Standard Life.  Recent 
wins include the £13.5m Mechanical Engineering building 
for Imperial College, for whom we have carried out over 
30 projects since our first project in 2000.  We are making 
good progress on the Nido Spitalfields 35 storey student 
accommodation tower for Blackstone which is due for 
completion in August 2010.  In February 2009 we started 
on site on the Velodrome for the London 2012 Olympics 
and have achieved an Olympic Delivery Authority’s key 
milestone of completing the Velodrome foundations by 
May 2009.
The business has an order book of £188m (2008 - £357m), 
of which £140m is to be delivered in the current financial 
year (2008 - £200m).  With the decline in the pipeline of 
office new build and refurbishment opportunities, we 
would anticipate revenue in 2009/10 to be 33% lower than 
2008/09 levels.  
Regional Construction
Our Regional Construction businesses which include the 
activities of our offices based in Manchester, Bradford, 
Birmingham, Bristol, Ipswich and Maidstone, performed 
well despite the reduction in private sector work.  Revenue 
in the period increased by 22% to £367m (2008 - £302m).  
The results include a full year’s contribution from Pearce 
Construction (2008 - seven and a half months).  On a 
like for like basis, revenue for the Regional Construction 
businesses grew by 10%.
Operating profit increased by 31% to £3.0m (2008 - 
£2.3m), resulting in an operating margin on revenue of 
0.8% (2008 - 0.7%).
During the year, 62% of revenue related to public sector 
clients (2008 - 40%).  Across our Regional Construction 
businesses we now have the benefit of a significant 
number of public sector frameworks covering core sectors 
of affordable housing, local authorities, health and prisons.  
These frameworks delivered £66m of revenue and we have

13 already been allocated £50m of projects for the current 
financial year, including £22m under the Aspire Ministry 
of Defence framework and £13m under the North West 
Prison framework.  In May we were appointed as one of 
eleven contractors to the Construction Framework South 
West, a four year framework expected to deliver £500m 
of construction activity.  We were also successful in being 
appointed as one of three contractors on a three year 
framework for Severn Trent Water.
During the year, we worked on 45 education projects 
with a total revenue of £118m (2008 - £50m) including the 
Suffolk Sixth Form Centre in Ipswich, Gateway College in 
Leicester, St John’s School in Marlborough, St Brendan’s 
College in Bristol and Sir John Deane’s College in Cheshire.  
We have an education order book of £108m as at the end 
of June 2009 (2008 - £90m), which includes the recently 
won City Technology Centre Kingshurst Academy in Solihull 
and the motor neurone disease research centre at the 
University of Sheffield.
Work for our private sector clients included building two 
new Asda stores in South Wales, Manchester Airport 
Terminal 1 airside refurbishment, our fourth Village Hotel, 
the Toronto Square development in Leeds, the Salthouse 
Hotel on the Ipswich waterfront, and commercial offices 
for Standard Life in Guildford.
As at 30 June 2009, the total order book for the Regional 
Construction businesses stands at £286m (2008 - £305m), 
of which 62% relates to public sector works and £224m is 
to be delivered in the current financial year (2008 - £238m).  
With the likely pressure on public sector capital spending 
we are anticipating that revenues will decline by circa 10% 
in the current financial year.
Retail
Overall our Retail operations, Pearce Retail and ISG 
Cathedral, performed in line with expectations during the 
year, with revenue increasing by 52% to £208m (2008 
- £137m).  Our Retail operations are currently focused 
primarily on major food retail and bank branch roll out 
frameworks.  The results include a full year contribution 
from Pearce Retail (2008 - seven and a half months).  On a 
like for like basis the revenue for our Retail operations grew 
by 12% year on year.
Operating profit increased by 69% to £6.7m (2008 - 
£3.9m), resulting in an operating margin on revenue of 
3.2% (2008 - 2.9%).  
During the year Pearce Retail, which focuses primarily 
on major food retail customers, undertook a total of 67 
projects (2008 - 56 projects) comprising new builds, 
shell fit outs, extensions and refurbishments for Tesco, 
Asda, Sainsbury’s, Marks & Spencer and Morrisons.  
The business experienced a reduction in refurbishment

15 programmes by its key customers, but this has been 
compensated for by our ability to offer a wider range of 
services with an increased allocation of new build and 
extension projects, particularly by Asda and Morrisons.  In 
addition we have just been awarded our first new build 
opportunity for Tesco and anticipate being allocated further 
opportunities shortly.  
Since acquiring Pearce Retail, we have been successful in 
expanding the geography over which we service our food 
retail customers from Pearce’s historic South West market. 
For the current financial year our customers are continuing 
to be committed to their capital spend programs to 
increase square footage and hence the business has 
already been allocated by its major food retail customers 
contracts totalling approximately £84m (2008 - £103m).  
Since the year end we have received further instructions 
from customers for projects valued in excess of £30m and 
we have been notified of increased allocations by Asda, 
Tesco and Marks & Spencer for projects starting in the 
second half of the year.
During the year ISG Cathedral focused primarily on bank 
branch roll out frameworks undertaking 195 projects for 
Barclays Bank, Lloyds Banking Group, RBS and HSBC, 
including Barclays’ flagship branch projects in Manchester 
and London Piccadilly, the latter of which won the National 
Association of Shopfitters Design Partnership Award in 
conjunction with Aukett Tytherleigh.  ISG Cathedral was 
successfully appointed to a new four year framework 
agreement with Barclays and successfully re-bid a four year 
framework agreement with the Lloyds Banking Group.
In addition ISG Cathedral undertook nine new concept 
projects for high street fashion retail clients at Westfield, 
White City including Tiffany & Co, La Senza and Monsoon, 
its 100th store for T -Mobile in the year, two projects for 
Primark and refurbishment works on two hotel projects for 
The Doyle Collection.
For the current financial year, ISG Cathedral has already 
been allocated 340 projects by Barclays Bank, Lloyds 
Banking Group, RBS and HSBC resulting in an order book 
of £51m (2008 - £70m).  Our retail banking customers 
continue to be committed to their capital spend programs 
recognising the importance of their UK depositor bases in 
the present economy and commencing implementation of 
rebranding programmes.
Overall our Retail operations have an order book as at 
30 June 2009 of £135m (2008 - £173m).  With recent 
allocations from our major food retail clients and bank 
branch roll-out framework clients, we are confident of 
maintaining activity levels throughout the current financial 
year.

17 Asia
In our Asia operations, revenue increased by 24% to £63m 
(2008 - £51m).  The business increased operating profit 
by 23% to £2.1m (2008 - £1 .7m), representing 12% (2008 
- 9%) of group trading operating profit, resulting in an 
operating margin on revenue of 3.4% (2008 - 3.4%).
The business enjoyed higher activity levels from its 
offices in China (Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai) with 
revenue up 160% and a retail refurbishment project for 
Swire Properties in Beijing contributing significantly to 
this increase.  However Hong Kong, Tokyo, Malaysia 
and particularly Singapore were impacted by the global 
economic situation and the collapse of Lehman Brothers, 
which short term led to a loss in confidence and the delay/
cancellation of a number of projects.
In the year the business provided consultancy services 
and delivered projects for a broad range of clients in 
the retail, financial and corporate sectors including 
Apple, Emporio Armani, UGG, Mandarin Oriental, Swire 
Properties, Standard Chartered Bank, Bohai Bank, Barclays, 
Credit Suisse, JP Morgan, Fidelity, Merrill Lynch, Shell, 
ExxonMobil, Ogilvy & Mather and Deloitte.
In Asia we have continued to strengthen our management 
resources for the next phase of growth and we have 
invested in larger offices in China to support the growth.
The business is carrying forward an order book of £42m 
as at June 2009 (2008 - £34m) and this includes the recent 
securing of two fit out opportunities for Marina Bay Sands 
totalling £21m in Singapore.  Since the year end we have 
secured further fit out projects totalling £15m.  With the 
improved order book and continuing improving prospects 
for the region, we are anticipating increased activity levels 
of approximately 20% in the current financial year.  
Middle East
We have continued to resource the joint venture with Al 
Habtoor Leighton Group which is to provide fit out and 
joinery services across the Middle East, and this has led to 
an operating loss of circa £0.4m in the year on revenue of 
£2.3m.  The joint venture was completed in June 2009 and 
we anticipate it making a positive contribution in the first 
half of the current financial year on the back of a current 
total order book of £12m, which includes the refurbishment 
project of the Sheikh Zayed Sports Stadium in Abu Dhabi.  
We continue to build a strong pipeline of opportunities in 
Dubai and Abu Dhabi and since year end we have been 
selected for three further projects totalling £8m.

19 Europe
Our European business, which has the shortest order 
book of all our businesses, experienced the most severe 
reaction to the global economic situation in the second half 
of the financial year.  Post Lehman Brothers, the business’s 
key customer base of international financial services and 
technology companies delayed or cancelled their strategic 
projects across Europe.  As a result of this revenue 
declined by 4% to £29m (2008 - £30m).  On a like for like 
basis  the business showed a decline in revenue in the 
year of 17%.  The business contributed an operating profit 
of £1 .4m (2008 - £3.1m), representing 8% (2008 - 17%) 
of group trading operating profit, resulting in an operating 
margin on revenue of 4.8% (2008 - 10.3%).  The lower 
margin reflects a trend towards a higher proportion of 
tendered work and increased investment in the business’s 
infrastructure as we expand our coverage in both sector 
and geographical offerings.
With offices in Paris, Frankfurt, Milan and Geneva the 
business delivered projects for RBS, the Accor Group, Iron 
Mountain, Cardinal Health, Yahoo, Ace Insurance, Adobe, 
Google and General Reinsurance.
The business has agreed a strategic partnership with a 
leading international petrochemical customer, where we 
have now completed one project and anticipate working 
on five further projects totalling £20m over the next 18 
months in Europe and the Middle East.
The business has throughout the period devoted resources 
to developing its supply chain into Eastern Europe and is 
now delivering a number of projects in Moscow, Poland 
and Bulgaria for international clients.  In addition it has 
opened an office in Amsterdam to service the Benelux 
countries.
As at June 2009, the business had an order book of £6m 
(2008 - £8m) reflecting the quieter commercial office 
market in Paris and the completion of a number of projects 
in Geneva.  Since year end we have seen an increase in 
demand for our services and we have been awarded a 
further £13m of work including a project with Rolls Royce 
in Poland, a project for Hackett in Paris and projects for our 
leading international petrochemical customer in Brussels 
and Hanover.

21 Outlook
At the end of June 2009, our total order book was £822m 
(2008 - £1,051m), of which £686m (2008 - £756m) is for 
delivery in the current financial year and £122m (2008 - 
£283m) for the next financial year.  The business continues 
to position itself towards more resilient regions and 
sectors.
In the UK our Retail frameworks continue to give us 
visibility through the current year, where our clients are 
committed to maintaining their current capital investment 
programs in both the food and retail banking sectors.  
In London and our Regional Construction businesses we 
have already secured two thirds of our targeted revenue 
for the current financial year.
In our Asia business demand continues to be driven from 
China aided by a strong recovery in the Singapore market.  
In the Middle East from a low base we are continuing to 
build a strong pipeline that should enable the business to 
grow in profitability.  In Europe we continue to widen our 
geography and are making progress in diversifying into 
other sectors.  
We are now seeing tentative signs of improvements in 
pipelines in some of our major markets including Asia, 
Europe and London Fit out, with our core clients in the 
financial services, petrochemical and technology sectors 
once again making strategic investments.  This is giving us 
an increased level of optimism for the longer term.

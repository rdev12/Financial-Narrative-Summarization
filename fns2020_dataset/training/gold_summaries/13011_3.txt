Statement

Introduction 
 
The financial year 2007-8 has been a mixed year for the RDF Group (‘the Group’). The Group’s 
Recruitment division has performed strongly but the Managed Services division has suffered as a result of 
the impact of the credit crunch on one of its major clients. 
 
Results 
 
Total revenue in the year is £30.489m (2007: £22.227m) with the major growth coming from the 
Recruitment Services division. Operating profit, before exceptional items, is £0.747m (2007: £1.315m) 
and operating profit, after exceptional items, is £0.162m (2007: £1.193m).  As a result, the loss per 
share is 0.66p (2007: Earnings per share 7.17p). 
 
The Board can report that the Group was profitable in the last quarter of the financial year and that it 
has remained profitable in the first quarter of the current financial year 2008-9. Having not paid an 
interim dividend for 2007-8, the Board is pleased to recommend a final dividend of 0.75p per share 
(2007: 1.25p), bringing the total to be paid for the year to 0.75p per share (2007: 2.25p). 
 
Strategic Developments 
 
During the last quarter of the year, the Board reviewed the current strategy of the Group’s investment in 
both its Managed Services division and Recruitment division. As a result of this review the Board 
concluded that its Managed Services division should be sold, subject to achieving an acceptable price.  
The Board appointed Smith & Williamson Corporate Finance Limited to manage the sale process and 
announced the decision on 17 June 2008. So far no formal offers have been received for the business 
although a number of expressions of interest have been received. 
 
Outlook 
 
In the prevailing economic climate, all companies face new and unusual challenges and the Group is no 
different.  Notwithstanding this, due to the measures we have put in place, we are confident that the 
Board’s strategy will deliver results and expect the Group to return to profitability.  The possible 
disposal of the Managed Services division should have little direct effect on 2008-9 but is expected to 
enhance earnings over time.

Kier Group plc  Annual Report & Accounts 2013 Cover: 
Kier Construction has completed 
the Southend Pier Cultural Centre 
which is now open to the public 
ahead of an official opening this 
autumn. Built off-site at Tilbury 
Docks, the placing of the cultural 
centre onto the 120-year-old cast 
iron Southend Pier more than a mile 
out to sea presented the project 
team with a number of obstacles. 
The Kier team rose to the 
challenge with a fantastic result, 
and the new cultural centre has 
reinstated Southend’s most 
famous landmark by creating a 
vibrant public space on the pier 
from which to enjoy the landscape 
of the Thames Estuary.

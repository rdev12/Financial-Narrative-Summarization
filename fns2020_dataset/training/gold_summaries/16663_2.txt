OUR BUSINESS Steel division The continuous casting of steel  
is a highly demanding process that is critically 
dependent upon consistent product quality and 
optimised production. Vesuvius provides systems, 
products and services that allow steel mills to 
control the flow of molten metal in the continuous 
casting process. Our products protect the steel 
from oxidation and chemical contamination, 
increasing efficiency and productivity, enhancing 
quality, reducing the environmental footprint and 
improving the safety of the casting process.
Steel Flow c ontrol supplies products used to 
channel and control the flow of molten steel from 
ladle to tundish and from tundish to mould; slide 
gate refractories for furnaces ladles and tundishes; 
slide gate systems; temperature measurement and 
slag level detection systems; tundish and mould 
fluxes; and control devices to monitor and regulate 
steel flow into the mould. These products have 
been designed to resist extreme thermomechanical 
stress and corrosive environments. The majority of 
these products are consumed during the process  
of making steel and, consequently, demand is 
primarily linked to steel production volumes. 
Continuing innovation allows us to offer  
enriched solutions that create additional value  
in our customers’ processes, leading to a  
sales progression regularly ahead of steel 
production volumes.
a dvanced Refractories include specialist 
refractory materials for lining steelmaking vessels 
such as blast furnaces, ladles and tundishes.  
These are in the form of powder mixes, which are 
spray-applied or cast onto the vessel to be lined 
(“monolithics“) and refractory shapes (e.g. bricks, 
pads and dams). Vesuvius is one of the world’s 
largest manufacturers of monolithic refractory 
linings for vessels subject to extreme temperatures, 
corrosion and abrasion. Key success factors in the 
Advanced Refractories product line are installation 
technologies, products adapted to fit customers’ 
processes, and effective and efficient logistics 
services. These factors are successfully combined 
with Vesuvius’ R&D centres, its knowledge of 
customers’ processes and its project management 
capability to deliver market-leading solutions to  
our customers.

Vesuvius’ Foundry division trading as Foseco,  
is a world leader in the supply of consumable 
products, solutions and associated services related 
to the foundry industry. The foundry process is 
highly sequential and, similar to the continuous 
casting of steel, is critically dependent on 
consistency of product quality and productivity 
optimisation. The Foundry division’s solutions and 
advanced computer simulation techniques allow 
foundries to reduce defects and hence reduce 
labour-intensive fettling and machining, minimise 
metal usage requirements, influence the metal 
solidification process and automate moulding  
and casting, thus reducing cost, energy usage  
and mould size.
The conditioning of molten metal, the nature of  
the mould used and, especially, the design of the 
way metal flows into the mould are key parameters 
in a foundry, determining both the quality of the 
finished castings and the labour, energy and  
metal usage efficiency of the foundry. Vesuvius’ 
products and associated services to foundries 
improve these parameters.

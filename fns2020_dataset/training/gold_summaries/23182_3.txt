  W e deliv er ed 
another year of 
solid progress 
producing a

performance
Chairman  and Group CEO  statement
  Ov er view
We delivered another year of solid progress producing a good 
 nancial performance in line with our guidance given in January. 
We are embedding ‘Our vision, our future’ and it is encouraging 
to see how enthusias � c our people are about ‘Bringing life to 
technology™’. We con � nue to focus on our customers and our 
opera � onal founda � ons. We are pleased with the progress that 
has been made over the last two years.

Customers remain our key focus; the two of us have visited over 
27 during the past year. Our annual customer survey ra � ngs have 
improved and we are increasingly being seen as a key partner. 
We have con � nued to improve our opera � onal e ﬀ ec � veness 
demonstrated by margin improvements in all three divisions. 
The divisions are demonstra � ng ownership and responsibility 
for their individual businesses and are being agile in responding 
to the challenges they face. We have recon  rmed our strategy, 
maintaining our investment in the areas where we are seeing 
the greatest poten � al for growth. It was pleasing to complete 
the acquisi � on of SP Devices, a step forward in our strategy 
to provide customers with board-level solu � ons and specialist 
applica � ons exper � se.
The year ended 31 March 2016 represents our third consecu � ve 
year of revenue growth in markets with slow overall growth. 
Our investment priori � es remain Industrial Vision, Space, 
Radiotherapy and Semiconductors, whilst con � nuing to support 
customers across our other ac � vi � es. We are seeing the bene  ts 
of this disciplined approach. We have seen slower growth in 
many of our markets this year, so our innova � on is allowing us 
to make new markets and to take market share to support 
our growth. 
 P erf ormance 
The Group delivered reported revenues of £236.4m, an increase 
of 5.1% (2015: £224.9m), and maintained the adjusted
(1)
 
opera � ng pro  t margin at 17.8%, which resulted in adjusted
(3)
 
earnings per share increasing 6.7% from 13.68p last year to 
14.59p this year.
 The culture change within the business over the past two years 
is improving how we operate. We saw strong revenue growth 
in Imaging, both in Professional Imaging and Space Imaging, 
driven by innova � on and improving opera � onal performance. 
We have delivered a signi  cant margin improvement in Imaging 
and Semiconductors. In RF Power we saw modest margin 
improvement despite lower revenue, demonstra � ng the bene  ts 
of reorganisa � on and good cost control. 
  A dj u s te d
(1)
 opera � ng pro  t increased from £40.1m to £42.0m, 
a � er absorbing a £5.5m swing in foreign exchange, represen � ng 
growth of 4.7%. These results re  ect a good performance 
through the year, with a par � cularly strong fourth quarter. 
Comparing year on year performance, we saw organic growth 
in our Industrial Vision, Space, Radiotherapy, Commercial and 
Industrial businesses, with lower revenues in RF defence. We 
also bene  ted from the acquisi � on of AnaFocus and SP Devices, 
par � ally o ﬀ set by the disposal of our Thermal Imaging business. 
The  nancial posi � on of the Group remains strong with net 
borrowings of £21.1m (2015: £5.2m). In terms of working capital 
movements this is in line with our working capital model, and 
decisions that we consciously made in the second half. Inventory 
and trade receivables have increased in Imaging to support 
growth. We made progress on our reorganisa � ons and had 
lower accruals for incen � ve payments in the year. We completed 
our programme to reduce concentra� on in our supply chain 
in RF Power and have u � lised advanced payments as we have 
delivered on Space programmes. This was in part supported by 
reduc � ons in planned capital expenditure in the later part of  001

e2v technologies plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 201 6         
Shareholder Informa � on Strategic Report Governance Financials
the year such that this remained equivalent to deprecia � on and 
amor � sa � on. Acquisi � ons u � lised £13.0m of cash. This included 
the acquisi � on of SP Devices, earn out payments on AnaFocus 
and product line acquisi � ons in Semiconductors, less the 
proceeds from the sale of the Thermal Imaging business.
We have bene  ted from making the divisions more accountable 
for their end-to-end performance and reorganising them so they 
can focus on delivery to their customers. A refreshed management 
team for Space Imaging has been established under the new 
divisional president and we are beginning to see the bene  ts of 
the changes they are making. We have made progress on the 
reorganisa � on of the RF Power opera � ons in our Chelmsford 
facility ‘Project Sunrise’. We have established separate units for 
our specialist defence ac � vi � es in Lincoln, and we have completed 
the reorganisa � on of our US businesses. We were pleased to 
complete the sale of our Thermal Imaging business in October, 
further simplifying our Professional Imaging business.
As part of the evolu � on of the Group we have refreshed the 
management and refocused our people to be � er meet our 
customers’ needs. This aligns our people more closely with our 
strategy and provides them with more opportunity to share in 
the success of the Group. 
We closed the year, as expected, with a 12 month order book 
at £130m, an 11% decrease over the prior year of £146m. This 
re  ects the changing composi � on in the Group’s revenues with 
growth coming in shorter order cover businesses, delivery on 
programmes in Space Imaging and the cycle of the Radiotherapy 
business along with the an � cipated decline in RF defence.
 Dividend
The Board has recommended a  nal dividend of 3.8p per share, 
bringing the full year dividend to 5.4p per share, an increase of 
5.9% from last year’s full year dividend of 5.1p and in line with 
our progressive dividend policy. The  nal dividend is scheduled 
for payment on 2 August 2016 to shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 8 July 2016.
Direc on
We con � nue to embed our vision, ‘Bringing life to technology™’. 
As part of the Group’s strategic cycle, the Board has reviewed 
progress in the implementa � on of our strategy with its refocus 
on customers, markets and opportuni � es. This has rea ﬃ  rmed 
the a � rac � veness of our selected areas of investment priority.
Our strategic drivers bring together our vision. We con � nue to 
focus on our customers; this is our core belief. Our customers 
have provided improved scores in our most recent customer 
survey. We are seeing real progress in embedding the new 
culture and how everyone can make changes in what they do 
to bene  t our customers. We have strengthened management, 
simpli  ed our processes and reorganised our remaining central 
opera � ons leading to lower costs and improved margins. We 
con � nue to focus on opera � onal improvement, with an ongoing 
focus on process e ﬀ ec � veness  in Space Imaging. We are 
inves � ng in innova � on in our chosen markets where we see that 
there is strong customer pull and increasingly working with our 
customers as their trusted innova � on partner. We have made 
considerable progress over the last two years through self-help 
and the business is in good shape to respond when market 
condi � ons improve.
We successfully completed two acquisi � ons over the last 
two years and we con � nue to build a pipeline of possible 
opportuni � es. The � ming and terms of any par � cular deal 
is di ﬃ  cult to predict. To support this, the Board sees an 
appropriate target net indebtedness level of not more than 1.5x 
net borrowings to EBITDA. This could rise for a period of � me 
closer to the Group’s  nancing arrangements limit if there was 
an excep � onal acquisi � on and the Board was con  dent that 
leverage would reduce in a � mely manner post such acquisi � on.
Safety, health and environment
We are con � nuing our journey with our Safety, Health and 
Environmental Leadership Team (SHELT) programme. We are 
encouraged by the commitment of employees to iden � fy 
hazards and make proac � ve sugges � ons for changes to reduce 
risk. This is improving the safety of our working environment 
as we can take ac � on before issues arise. The Group maintains 
its good health and safety record with no serious incidents and 
improved sta ﬀ  safety recognised in a decrease in the accident 
count during the year. The Group is commi � ed to opera � ng in 
an environmentally sustainable way and we have reduced our 
normalised greenhouse gas emissions despite our growth.
 P eople
We are pleased with the ongoing engagement of our employees 
with our vision of ‘Bringing life to technology™’. Our people have 
used their talents to sustain innova � on and supply the solu � ons 
our customers seek. Our sta ﬀ  are commi � ed to pu �  ng the 
customer at the centre of everything that they do, simplifying 
how they do things and opera � ng in an e ﬀ ec � ve and e ﬃ  cient 
manner. We regularly celebrate success and value everyone’s 
contribu � on and are working together to improve what we do 
and work smarter. 
We remain commi � ed to o ﬀ ering opportuni � es to our people 
and new joiners to develop their careers. Amongst our sta ﬀ  of 
1,750, we welcome 271 new joiners, 29 of whom are on our 
graduate and appren � ce schemes, and we congratulate 113 
people who have been promoted. 
We are grateful to all of our employees for their hard work 
during this year and thank them for their commitment and 
success in growing the Group’s businesses. It was par � cularly 
pleasing to see the commitment of our people to deliver the 
performance in the  nal quarter. We were able to formally 
recognise this through discre � onary bonus payments at modest 
cost. 
Overall, we are pleased that we are delivering ‘Our vision, our 
future’.
Outlook
Whilst we remain cau � ous about the broader economic 
environment, our outlook for the current  nancial year remains 
unchanged with a similar  rst half, second half weigh � ng to that 
in the previous  nancial year.

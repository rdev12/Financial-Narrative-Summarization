TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC | Annual Report 2011
Chairman’s statement
The	 demerger	 of	 TalkTalk	 from	 Carphone	 Warehouse	 at	 the	
end	 of	 last	 year	 was	 designed	 to	 build	 value	 for	 Shareholders	
by	 giving	 both	 companies	 the	 freedom,	 focus	 and	 flexibility	 to	
develop	 and	 pursue	 the	 strategies	 that	 were	 right	 for	 each	 of	
them.	 One	 year	 on,	 there	 can	 be	 no	 doubt	 that	 the	 demerger	
has	 worked.	 TalkTalk’s	 first	 year	 as	 a	 standalone	 company	 has	
been	 one	 of	 intense	 activity	 and	 we	 are	 delivering	 the	 benefits	
of	 our	 growth	 and	 scale,	 reporting	 strong	 growth	 in	 earnings	
and	 operating	 free	 cash	 flow.	
I	 have	 sometimes	 described	 TalkTalk’s	 acquisition	 of	 Tiscali	 	
in	 2009	 as	 being	 like	 a	 snake	 swallowing	 a	 goat	 –	 prolonged,	
sometimes	 painful	 but	 worth	 it	 in	 the	 end!	 We	 started	 the	 	
year	 with	 our	 Tiscali	 customers	 having	 been	 rebranded	 and	
moved	 onto	 TalkTalk	 tariffs,	 but	 still	 on	 separate	 networks	 and	
separate	 billing	 systems.	 Through	 the	 course	 of	 the	 year	 we	
migrated	 almost	 all	 of	 them	 onto	 our	 own	 network	 and	 billing	
system.	 This	 was	 an	 enormous	 and	 complex	 operation,	 at	 the	
end	 of	 which	 we	 have	 a	 stronger,	 integrated	 business	 that	 is	
ready	 to	 take	 the	 next	 big	 steps	 forward.
The	 process	 of	 absorbing	 Tiscali’s	 customers	 into	 TalkTalk	 	
was	 not	 always	 painless,	 and	 some	 suffered	 disruption	 to	 	
their	 service.	 We	 sometimes	 did	 not	 deal	 with	 these	 problems	
as	 well	 as	 we	 should	 have	 done,	 and	 this	 resulted	 in	 some	
customers	 getting	 frustrated	 with	 us	 and	 leaving	 TalkTalk.	
However,	 I	 am	 certain	 that	 for	 those	 customers	 who	 stayed	
with	 TalkTalk,	 and	 they	 are	 the	 vast	 majority,	 the	 journey	 	
was	 worthwhile	 and	 they	 will	 now	 enjoy	 a	 consistently	 	
better	 customer	 experience.	
The	 successful	 integration	 of	 Tiscali	 has	 given	 us	 a	 strong	
base	 to	 build	 on,	 but	 there	 is	 still	 a	 huge	 job	 to	 do	 to	 make	
TalkTalk	 more	 efficient	 and	 to	 give	 our	 customers	 an	 even	
better	 experience.	 We	 are	 now	 implementing	 a	 new	 strategy	 	
to	 do	 this,	 and	 to	 drive	 further	 revenue	 and	 profit	 growth.	 	
This	 includes	 transforming	 the	 way	 we	 work,	 expanding	
the	 coverage	 of	 our	 network,	 and	 developing	 exciting	
new	 products	 and	 services	 for	 our	 customers.
At	 the	 heart	 of	 TalkTalk	 is	 our	 commitment	 to	 be	 the	 UK’s	 best	
value	 for	 money	 provider	 of	 broadband,	 voice	 and	 television	
services.	 That	 commitment	 is	 now	 more	 important	 than	 ever.	
Consumers	 and	 businesses	 are	 still	 facing	 a	 difficult	 economic	
environment,	 with	 budgets	 under	 pressure	 and	 likely	 to	 remain	
so	 for	 some	 time.	 Broadband	 is	 now	 an	 essential	 service,	 and	
we	 will	 be	 absolutely	 true	 to	 our	 heritage	 of	 giving	 customers	
consistently	 the	 best	 value	 for	 money	 products	 in	 the	 market.	
Giving	 customers	 value	 is	 about	 more	 than	 offering	 them	 the	
lowest	 prices.	 It	 is	 also	 about	 what	 they	 get	 for	 their	 money,	
and	 we	 have	 now	 included	 our	 unique	 new	 HomeSafe	 service	
into	 all	 TalkTalk	 products.	 Parents	 are	 becoming	 increasingly	
concerned	 about	 what	 the	 internet	 can	 bring	 into	 their	 homes,	
and	 HomeSafe	 allows	 them	 to	 control	 this	 effectively.	 It	 also	
demonstrates	 how	 TalkTalk	 can	 use	 its	 advanced	 network	
technology	 to	 develop	 innovative	 services	 that	 customers	 want.	
Early	 next	 year	 we	 will	 be	 transforming	 our	 customers’	
television	 viewing	 experience.	 UK	 households	 can	 currently	
choose	 between	 Freeview,	 the	 free,	 basic	 multi	 channel	 	
TV	 service	 with	 limited	 functionality,	 and	 high	 cost	 pay	 TV	
services,	 offering	 an	 extensive	 range	 of	 content	 and	 functions.	
YouView	 from	 TalkTalk	 will	 bridge	 the	 gap	 between	 these	 two	
extremes.	 Customers	 will	 get	 all	 the	 Freeview	 content	 they	 are	
used	 to,	 but	 with	 advanced	 catch	 up	 and	 video	 on	 demand	
functions,	 all	 integrated	 within	 a	 simple,	 intuitive	 program	
menu.	 And	 they	 will	 get	 all	 this	 in	 value	 for	 money	 packages	
that	 are	 just	 not	 available	 in	 the	 market	 now.	
In	 this	 very	 active	 year,	 we	 have	 mapped	 out	 our	 course	 for	 	
the	 next	 phase	 of	 TalkTalk’s	 development,	 and	 taken	 some	
major	 steps	 forward.	 To	 reflect	 this	 progress,	 from	 the	 start	 	
of	 the	 2012	 financial	 year,	 we	 intend	 to	 distribute	 50%	 of	 	
our	 Headline	 earnings	 per	 share	 as	 regular	 dividends.
Last	 year	 was	 a	 challenging	 one	 for	 our	 employees,	 and	 	
on	 behalf	 of	 the	 Board	 I	 would	 like	 to	 thank	 them	 all	 for	 	
their	 efforts,	 and	 for	 their	 continuing	 commitment	 to	 	
TalkTalk	 and	 to	 our	 customers.
“ This first year since our demerger has been one 
of intense activity for TalkTalk, building a strong 
base on which we can offer an enhanced 
experience for all our customers, and continue 
to grow our revenue and profitability.”
Charles Dunstone

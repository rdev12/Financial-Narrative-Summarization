Chief Executive’s Report
01 Business Review 02 Management and Governance 03 Financial Statements
R e s u l t s 
After the extraordinarily difficult business environment of 2008, 
2009 presented no less a challenging period. Equity market volumes 
continued to decline, whilst corporate fund raising activity continued 
for much of the year at the depressed levels seen in 2008, albeit 
beginning to tentatively recover in the second half of 2009. It is 
therefore very satisfying to report a return to profitability for the year.
Group statutory profit before tax for the year increased substantially 
to £11.1m (2008: £12.7m loss). Group adjusted operating profit improved 
similarly to £20.8m for the period (2008: £2.7m loss). Adjusted 
diluted earnings per share was 7.83p (2008: 1.17p) with statutory 
diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 3.87p 
(2008: 5.18p loss).
These results were achieved through a diversified mix of income 
which totalled £129.4m (2008: £63.9m) and a continued discipline 
on costs.
Group full year dividend is up 24% year on year to 2.50p, more 
than covered by adjusted and statutory earnings.
The Group has retained its Balance Sheet strength and strong liquidity 
position with year end cash and cash equivalents up £5.9m to £109.5m.
 
Both principal operating businesses, Investment Banking (Evolution 
Securities Limited) and Private Clients (Williams de Broë Limited) 
traded profitably during 2009 with Investment Banking reporting a 
significant improvement in adjusted operating profit to £18.5m for 
2009 (2008: £5.4m loss).
The results for 2009 reflect the transformation of the Group, 
achieved over the last three years. The business mix is radically 
different today in terms of both the quality and breadth of income 
streams within the Group as shown below.
The graphs below put into context how these results have been 
achieved against a backdrop of a very challenging business 
environment and, in particular, illustrates how our strategy to 
diversify the business mix has begun to deliver results.
Although rising equity market levels have clearly helped the performance 
of the Private Client business in the year, through increased 
management fee levels, the continued low level of small-cap fund 
raising and low equity market volumes have not prevented a record 
level of income for the Group as a whole.
The graph above illustrates how the Group’s total income is no 
longer dependent on the levels of AIM market fund raising activity.
Prior to the transformation of the Group’s business mix such difficult 
market conditions would have continued to have had a detrimental 
impact on the Group’s overall income and profitability.

Our strategy for some time has been to achieve sustainable earnings 
growth by diversifying our business base and building recurring 
revenue streams. The Group has a long track record of acquiring 
financial assets and businesses at reasonable prices to create shareholder 
value. The Group was well placed going into the downturn in 
financial markets: 
> The Group had already begun to diversify its revenue mix towards 
recurring fee income through the acquisition of Williams de Broë 
Limited; and
> The Group took early and decisive action to adjust its cost base 
and preserve balance sheet strength and liquidity.
As a result of the Group being well positioned going into and through 
the downturn relative to many peers, we were able to complete three 
significant business initiatives in the space of nine months:
 
> The acquisition of the investment management team of Singer 
& Friedlander Investment Management Limited (“SFIM”) has 
brought over £1billion of new assets under management; 
> The development of our fixed income agency business within 
Evolution Securities Limited which has significantly expanded the 
range of products the Group covers and the number of institutional 
clients the Group services; and
> The build out of a large-cap Pan-European equity research and 
sales business resulted in net hires of 56 people within the business 
during the year.
The Group’s focus in 2009 has been on these three key initiatives, 
while continuing to develop the Group’s other businesses in accordance 
with the strategic aims and core principles, namely: 
Financial Strength
> Underpinned by a disciplined approach to investment;
> Focus on an agency model; and
> High Balance Sheet liquidity.
Partnership Culture
> Proper alignment and reward sharing between employees and 
shareholders; and
> Long-term view focused on relationships not transactions.
The Group has stayed true to these values throughout the downturn 
of 2008 and 2009, both in growing our existing businesses and in 
developing new ones.
The Group aims to maintain a high cash generation and low fixed cost 
agency model to deliver high margin and low risk returns. 
The heart of the Group’s business is building long term client 
relationships and developing a true partnership culture. The Evolution Group Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2009 9

Private Clients activities comprises Williams de Broë Limited, one 
of the UK’s leading and fastest growing retail investment managers, 
WDB Capital Limited, the investment manager to WDB Capital 
UK Equity Fund Limited, and WDB Assetmaster Management Company 
Limited, the investment manger of our multi manager collectives.
Williams de Broë Limited continues to increase in significance to the 
Group, both in terms of current performance, and in terms of business 
development momentum it is now displaying. Organic growth over 
the last five years, together with the successful integration in 2009 of 
the new teams in Edinburgh and from Singer & Friedlander Investment 
Management Limited in London, has created a market leading business 
of scale in its sector. 
The Private Client business performed robustly in 2009 despite the 
uncertain market conditions. Total net income for the year of £42.4m 
was up 23% on the prior period (2008: £34.5m). Recurring management 
fee income of £24.4m (2008: £17.4m) accounted for 58% of total net 
income, compared with 50% in the comparative period. Transactional 
volumes increased 47% to 167,000 (2008: 114,000) driving transactional 
income to £17.0m in the year (2008: £14.1m). Adjusted operating 
profit increased by 14% to £4.1m (2008: £3.6m), with a strong 
performance in the second half of 2009 as new teams started to 
register and margin improvement initiative began to deliver. 
Growth in assets under management remained a core focus within 
Williams de Broë Limited during 2009. At 31 December 2009, total 
assets under management reached a record level of £5.2bn, an 
increase of 37% from £3.8bn at the end of 2008. This represents an 
excellent performance for a period that saw the recruitment of no new 
investment managers or acquisitions of businesses, whilst management 
focused on completing the integration of the prior year. Headcount 
remained largely unchanged during the year at 268 (2008: 260). Net 
fund sales were achieved solely from organic growth. Net fund inflows 
of £322m (2008: £550m) were achieved by our discretionary sales 
team together with our investment managers. 
With a heritage dating back to 1869, Williams de Broë Limited has 
always prided itself on the quality of its people and the service it 
gives to clients. Its reputation has been founded on the following 
core values:
> Personal service – we have a personal service driven culture and 
our ethos is to maintain investment managers dedicated to our 
individual client’s needs;
> Bespoke by nature – we tailor our services to fulfil our individual 
client’s specific investment objectives and risk criteria; 
> Sound investment process – we maintain a significant resource in 
our investment process and have a strong focus to achieve 
investment excellence;
> True independence – we select “best of breed” investments, which are 
appropriate for our clients, without conflicts of interest. We also 
develop close relationships with our professional intermediary 
partners; and 
> Quality business infrastructure, back office and compliance departments. 
In summary, 2009 represents a year of significant achievement for 
Williams de Broë Limited with the successful integration of new 
teams in London and Edinburgh combining with organic sales 
momentum across the business to deliver sound investment 
performance and record results.
Whilst management initiatives to improve operating margins are 
now beginning to deliver, we have also ensured that there has been a 
commensurate investment in new systems and governance processes 
to anticipate the increased demands of our current growth ambitions.
The potent combination of a high quality team of investment professionals, 
a differentiated product, a respected brand and a highly scalable 
infrastructure together with sound financial strength of the Group 
has firmly positioned Williams de Broë Limited as an engine for 
significant further growth in the short and medium term.

Business Review
Chief Executive’s Report (continued)
I nv e s t m e nt	B a n k i n g
2009 saw a significant expansion to our Investment Banking division. 
Overall headcount grew significantly from 125 to 220 (up 76%) as a 
result of our two key business initiatives: the significant expansion of 
the agency fixed income team and; the significant large-cap equities 
team. The business was able to instigate these transforming initiatives 
for modest upfront investment in the midst of the continued market 
upheavals experienced in the early part of 2009.
As a result of these initiatives the Investment Banking division 
produced a record level of income in the period of £87.0m (2008: 
£29.7m), nearly three times (up 193%) from the level of income 
achieved in 2008. As a result adjusted operating profit increased 
£23.9m to £18.5m from a loss of £5.4m in 2008. 
All areas of the business contributed to this significant growth in  
the period, however, the main drivers were our agency equities and 
fixed income businesses. Equity sales commission income of £23.2m 
recorded a £9.9m (up 74%) increase on the prior year (2008: £13.3m) 
and fixed income commission of £35.3m recorded a £28.2m (up 
397%) increase on the prior year (2008 £7.1m). Our equity market 
making team achieved income of £13.0m compared with £0.1m in 
the prior period an increase of £12.9m. Corporate finance achieved 
income of £15.5m (2008: £9.2m), up £6.3m (up 68%) through the 
successful raising of £451m for our corporate clients (2008: £157m). 
Equities 
2009 was a transformational year for our equities business, our 
existing UK mid market equities platform was repositioned to 
include increased coverage of UK and Pan-European large-cap 
equities. We made significant hires across the equities platform, 
increasing the client facing staff by 108% over the year. 
Research
The strength and quality of our research lies at the heart of our equities 
offering and we now cover 312 companies compared with 176 in the 
prior year (up 77%). In 2009, we expanded our research coverage to 
include: Banks, Beverages, Consumers and Food Producers, Economics 
and Strategy, Food Retail, General Financials, Income Service, 
Luxury Goods, Pharmaceuticals and Biotech, Property, Support 
Services, Telecoms and Tobacco. We have also added more resource 
to our existing sector strengths in Aerospace, Industrials and Engineering, 
Mining, Oils, Travel and Leisure, Utilities and Growth companies. 
Our research team now has significant coverage of UK and Pan-European 
large-cap and UK mid and growth companies. The build-out of our 
research team is now largely complete, although we anticipate some 
selective hires in the current year, particularly where we can emphasise 
our key strengths of industry knowledge, sector expertise and research 
experience. As a result of the investment made in research through 
2009, we have experienced a significant re-rating of our research 
product from our institutional clients through the second half of 
2009 and into the current year. We are confident that this 
momentum will continue.  
Sales and trading
Our clients have an increasing requirement for high quality sales, 
sales trading and trading services. 2009 saw the transformation of 
our offering, our new colleagues have increased the strength and 
capability of our distribution strengths and execution services. 
During the second half of 2009, we began to experience the income 
opportunity that is available to our new platform, notwithstanding, 
the well documented concerns over market volumes and market 
values in 2009. We have added to our mid and small-cap UK trading 
expertise by now providing market making and distribution in the 
Euro Stoxx 300, and through our algorithmic trading functionality 
we have access to a large number of different pools of liquidity both 
light and dark, on behalf of our clients, in addition to all primary 
exchanges enabling us to offer our clients a first class execution 
capability. We have established offices in New York, Boston and 
Madrid in the second half of 2009 and continue to grow our distribution 
expertise at the local level, and although only 10 months into our 
expansion plans, we continue to see growing evidence and validation 
from our clients that the product offering is of the highest quality. 
During 2009, income within our equities business grew by £22.8m 
to £36.2m, an increase of 170%, and the number of institutional 
clients’ accounts grew by 89 to 597 an increase of 18%.
Fixed Income 
During 2009, our fixed income business saw significant upgrades in 
headcount and quality of product. The business was able to recruit a 
range of high quality specialists, with wide ranging experience and 
track records of providing their clients with well priced liquidity. 
Strategically, we have set out to develop our fixed income service to 
be “best in league” to offer genuinely un-conflicted research with no 
principal client conflicts. This provides a real focus on the buyer and 
seller, solving their liquidity requirements and providing transparent 
pricing. The fixed income business now principally covers six product 
areas across UK and Europe; Investment Grade Bonds, Asset Backed 
Securities, Emerging Markets, Government Bonds, High Yield and 
Distressed Bonds, and Illiquids (prefs and PIBS). Importantly 
Evolution Securities Fixed Income team has been rated for 2009 as 
the No.1 UK and European Fixed Income Agency House by Credit 
Magazine, polling over 52% of the vote.
During the year, fixed income revenues grew by £28.2m to £35.3m, 
an increase of 397%, whilst the number of institutional client accounts 
grew by 267 to 345, an increase of 342%.

Corporate Finance
Equity corporate finance and corporate broking
In 2009, we successfully completed 20 (2008: 9) placings on behalf 
of our clients, raising £451m (2008: £157m), which together with 
other advisory fees and retainers generated income of £15.5m up 
68% in the year (2008: £9.2m). Overall retained corporate clients 
grew from 70 to 76 during the course of 2009, and our efforts on the 
AIM market were recognised by Growth Company Investor Magazine  
(as voted by Directors of public companies) who voted Evolution 
Securities Limited, No. 1 AIM advisor for 2009.
Debt capital markets
Strategically, the core offering of strength in distribution was complemented 
during 2009 by the recruitment of key professionals in both Debt 
Advisory and Debt Capital Markets teams. It is already clear that 
there is a real requirement for corporates to look at a range of financing 
alternatives including Investment Grade and Non-Investment Grade 
bonds as well as private placement strategies, as traditional lending 
channels have become less obvious. The team are currently working 
on a range of mandates for potential transactions in 2010, enhancing 
upon the global distribution strengths that have been built during the 
year, and providing depth and clarity on pricing to our corporate clients.
In 2010, we will further recruit into our corporate finance division to 
continue the momentum of growth in new corporate client capture, 
but also to make sure that the coverage of our significantly expanded 
equities and fixed income business is suitably aligned with the strengths 
required in our corporate finance department.
I nv e s t m e nt 	B a n k i n g 	–	O u t l o o k
Evolution Securities Limited has made significant progress in 2009, 
both quantitatively and qualitatively, and we intend to continue to 
build on that growth in 2010. The distribution strengths that have 
been established in both equities and fixed income securities have 
been remarkable. A key opportunity is to marry these strengths with 
our capital markets services in both equity and debt, allowing us to 
find new and innovative financing solutions for our clients in a 
changing financing environment.
G r o u p 	–	O u t l o o k
The core of the Group strategy since early 2007 has been principally 
based around risk avoidance, combined with tight control of costs and 
a highly liquid and unencumbered Balance Sheet. This allowed the 
Group to capture significant optionality at the end of 2008 and into 
the beginning of 2009, in both the Investment Banking and Private 
Clients businesses. Already in 2009 we are beginning to see the returns 
and momentum that these actions have produced. A key part of our 
strategy is to continue to increase our strategic risk appetite within 
the parameters that we have laid out in this report, in order to continue 
to develop our recurring revenue and profit potential, and to drive 
further shareholder returns.
We note the regulatory dislocation beginning within the Investment 
Banking sector and the inevitable exit of capital deployed, and continue 
to see opportunities for increasing our risk appetite and potential 
returns. Our emphasis on agency skills, wherever possible, and a 
partnership structure achieved through shared future equity returns, 
allows flexibility of remuneration to play a key role in the retention 
of our talent and the attraction of new partners. In the future this 
should be at the core of further real and sustained growth.
The Group is very well positioned, and aims to continue to develop 
the strong momentum in revenue and profit growth in 2009 from all 
our activities. Although there is much uncertainty in global markets 
which provides challenges to short term trading, this only goes to 
underpin the long-term stability that the markets require to operate 
more effectively, and in fact reflects an underestimation of the global 
economic recovery and the beneficial impact of the robust nature of 
the capitalist model.
We look forward to further opportunities for growth in 2010, and I 
would like to thank all our employees for the extraordinary efforts  
to deliver the transformations to the Group over the course of 2009.

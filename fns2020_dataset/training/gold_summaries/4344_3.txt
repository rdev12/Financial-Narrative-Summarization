We continue to develop our radio network in Australia.
The launch of Nova 100 in December 2001 in Melbourne
was one of the most successful in radio history. I hope
that the launch of Nova 93.7 in Perth, which I will have
the pleasure to attend, proves to be equally successful.
Most of our business to business internet sites are profitable
and our consumer internet offerings are seeing larger
audiences and revenues. Our focus here is on the classified
advertising markets.
But the resilience of our Group in difficult times is based
on the strength of our established businesses. Associated
Newspapers has weathered a substantial fall in advertising
revenues by cutting costs and increasing the circulations
of its national titles. They did this despite cover price
increases, while others were cutting theirs. Associated
would have increased its profits but for the investment
in a new title, Ireland on Sunday.
Euromoney Institutional Investor has done very well in
increasing profits, despite a 12% fall in revenues. Teletext
has also been successful in defending its profitability,
despite the contraction of its core holiday advertising market.
Early in 2002, Pierre Côté retired from the Board. He has
been involved with the Group for many years and served as
a Director for seven of them. I thank him for his wise counsel
and wish him a long and happy retirement. Sir Patrick
Sergeant has announced that he will retire from the Board
early in 2004 – I will pay tribute to his contribution to the
Group nearer that time. Charles Dunstone, Chief Executive
of Carphone Warehouse, joined the Board in December
2001. He is already making a valuable contribution. I am
also pleased to welcome to the Board Francisco Balsemão,
Chairman and Chief Executive of Impresa SA.
I said a year ago that our people were by far our best asset.
This last turbulent period has again shown their quality
and, because of them, I am confident that our Group will
continue to thrive. I am sure all shareholders are most
grateful for their hard work and commitment.

Chairman ’s Statement
The resilience of our Group in difficult
times is based on the strength of our
established businesses.
After a year of big falls in the world’s equity and
advertising markets, I am glad to report higher Group
profits. This testifies both to the strength of our titles
and our businesses, and to the excellence of our editorial
and management teams.
Our strategy of investing in revenues other than advertising
has again paid off. DMG World Media had a marvellous
year, as have the business to business activities of DMG
Information. Two of our newer businesses, Metro and
Euromoney Institutional Investor’s Internet Securities, have
achieved break even towards the end of the year despite
the challenges in their markets. They will do much better
in the years to come.
DMGT has always believed in investing in its businesses.
Never is this more important than when times are hard.
This year we have continued the substantial investment
programme in our UK press capacity which should come
to fruition late in 2004. It is on time and within budget. We
have also chosen to invest more in the editorial, marketing
and distribution of our regional newspapers in order to
reverse the decline in their circulations. Early signs are
encouraging. These investments are why Northcliffe
Newspapers recorded marginally reduced profits, although
its spread of titles around the UK and the resilience of
advertising outside London have served it well.
Lord Rothermere
Chairman 07 Daily Mail and General Trust plc 06 Daily Mail and General Trust plc
10 years
Over the last ten years, DMGT has sought to reduce its
dependence on the UK, newspapers, and newsprint, the
price of which fluctuates. We have continued to invest in
and maintain the quality of our newspapers, but the rules
and regulations have made it difficult to expand in our
core UK markets. 
To grow as we wish, we have expanded geographically and into other media areas,
principally Teletext, Australian radio, exhibitions, business to business information and
careers. Over this period, we have invested the substantial cash flows of our core newspaper
businesses both to strengthen those businesses and to develop new divisions. In total,
more than £1.5 billion has been spent on acquisitions. A year after the Group returned to
its traditional strength of growing our businesses organically and, where appropriate, by
fill-in acquisitions, we set out below the key events and acquisitions of the last ten years.

FIVEaa 09 Daily Mail and General Trust plc
for debt owed to us, of the 25% of DMG Radio Australia we
did not already own. Other transactions have been relatively
small and designed to augment our existing businesses.
Generally we are finding that the prices asked for good media
assets are not reducing in line with stock markets, so we have
to look hard for value.
As regards the disposal of non-core assets, we have been able
to take advantage of strong property markets to sell a number
of properties that were surplus to requirements.
It seems appropriate for me to refer to the much publicised
issue of pensions. More employers have chosen to close
defined benefit schemes and to offer defined contribution
schemes to their employees. We aim to offer what we believe
to be the most appropriate form of pension benefit to our
employees, be that defined benefit or defined contribution.
We have had an actuarial valuation of our defined benefit
schemes carried out during the year and reviewed as at
September 2002; this showed the schemes remaining in
surplus and not requiring any increase in contributions.
We have also been required to undertake a valuation under
the rules set by the new accounting standard, FRS 17 and,
in common with most defined benefit schemes, ours showed
a substantial deficit as at September 2002. This is only for
accounting purposes and has no impact on the funding of our
schemes. Importantly, our schemes have more cash coming
in from contributions and investment income than is being
paid out in benefits, and so there is no need to sell assets at
what we hope are today’s depressed prices. We have no plans
to close any of our pension schemes.
Over the next 12 months, we will continue to invest in our
businesses and to look for suitable acquisitions to strengthen
them. We are quite comfortable with our current level of debt,
but in the current uncertain trading environment, would not
wish to see a substantial weakening of our debt ratios. We are
also likely to see the passing of the new Communications Act,
which will open up new possibilities for us.
I hope that you find the reviews interesting and informative.

Chief Executive’s Review
On the following pages you will find a detailed
review of the past year’s activities of each of the
Group’s divisions. As the Chairman has said in his
statement, it has been a challenging year, but one
in which the resilience of the Group as a whole has
been demonstrated.
Despite reporting profits higher this year than last, our share
price has not escaped the general weakness in the world’s
stock markets. As you can see from the graph above, the
DMGT ‘ A ’ Ordinary Non-Voting share price is currently
around 5% lower than this time last year, following a fall 
of 28% the previous year. The media sector has performed
substantially worse than the broader market, as it has fallen
from its “dot.com” inspired highs achieved early in 2000. It 
is some consolation that the DMGT share price has modestly
outperformed the media sector over that period and, as you
can see from the graphs on pages 40 and 44 continues to
outperform the market substantially over longer periods.
Over the last five years, DMGT has invested substantial
amounts of money in establishing new business divisions,
as well as strengthening our core newspaper operations.
It has been good to see these beginning to pay dividends
as with the profit improvement from our exhibition business,
dmg world media, and the business-to-business operations
of DMG Information.
As I indicated last year, the pace of making acquisitions has
slowed significantly, with the total amount spent reduced to
£119 million. The only substantial transactions have been the
purchase of Loot in October 2001, a business which fits well
with our other London titles, and the repurchase, in exchange

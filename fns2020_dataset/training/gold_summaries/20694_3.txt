 As your Interim Chairman, I am 
honoured to be presenting our 2016 
Annual Report, which highlights 
another year of excellent progress 
against our strategic objectives.”
Danuta Gray,
Interim Chairman
Another year of 
substantial progress
During the year the Group has 
continued executing on its strategy 
to deliver ‘banking as it should be’ to 
more customers and generating strong, 
sustainable returns for shareholders. 
Earnings per share have increased 
by 11% to 25.2p, generating an 
underlying return on average equity 
of 18%. These are excellent results in 
competitive markets and a testament 
to the dedication of colleagues across 
the Group.
Resilience in an uncertain 
operating environment
As well as being a year of considerable 
progress for Aldermore, 2016 has 
been a year of change and uncertainty 
for the banking industry as a whole, 
with evolving regulation, political 
developments and their corresponding 
impacts on the global economy. 
In particular, the UK’s referendum 
on EU membership and vote to leave 
introduced considerable volatility to 
financial markets, which impacted 
the share price of many companies, 
including Aldermore and other 
specialist lenders, as shown in the 
chart opposite. Following the vote, 
Aldermore’s business model has 
remained resilient, demonstrated by 
our financial results and partly reflected 
in the share price performance 
during the second half of the year. 
There remains much uncertainty 
regarding the precise nature and timing 
of Britain’s exit from the EU. However, 
the Board remains confident that the 
business can continue to respond to the 
opportunities and threats this presents 
and continue to successfully deliver 
against our strategic objectives.

Strategic report
Chairman’s 
statement Commitment to strong 
Governance
The Board’s responsibility to provide 
strong and effective governance 
remains paramount. Throughout 2016 
we were fully compliant with the 
Corporate Governance Code 2014 
and having overseen the Board 
effectiveness review in my capacity 
as Senior Independent Director, I have 
every confidence in the continued 
strength and cumulative experience 
of the Board. 
I would like to take this opportunity to 
welcome Chris Patrick to the Board 
and to thank Peter Cartwright and Neil 
Cochrane for their services as Non- 
Executive Directors. Both Peter and 
Neil made valuable contributions to the 
Aldermore Board, as representatives 
of our Principal Shareholders, AnaCap 
Financial Partners LLP. 
On behalf of the Board I would also like 
to extend particular gratitude to Glyn 
Jones, who has served as Chairman 
of the Aldermore Board since March 
2014. Glyn played an instrumental 
role in Aldermore’s significant growth 
and transition to a listed company and 
leaves behind a strong, experienced and 
dedicated Board. 
We are progressing in our search 
for a successor for Glyn and are 
confident we will secure a strong 
replacement to oversee Aldermore’s 
continuing progress. 
Our communities
We remain committed to investing in 
our communities, whether that is within 
Aldermore through development of the 
team; our local communities through 
volunteering and fundraising; or the 
broader UK economy through lending to 
businesses, homeowners and landlords. 
We are also committed to strong 
corporate citizenship. 
We support the drive to create greater 
accountability and transparency 
throughout the banking sector and 
have worked to ensure compliance 
with the FCAs Senior Management 
Regime from March 2016, as well as 
joining the Banking Standards Board in 
the year. We are also proud signatories 
of the Women in Finance Charter and 
are committed to both developing 
greater female representation in 
senior positions across the Group and 
promoting the advantages of diversity 
more broadly across the business. 
More on our role in our communities can 
be found in our Corporate Responsibility 
Section on pages 36–38. 
Outlook
The Board is committed to supporting 
the substantial progress Aldermore 
is making in operational development 
and financial performance, as well 
as managing the challenges that 
this presents. 
The EU referendum introduced greater 
uncertainty. However, the UK economy 
has remained resilient to date. 
Your Board remains confident that 
Aldermore can continue to grow within 
existing risk appetite generating strong, 
sustainable returns for shareholders.

Interim Chairman

1 The 2014 statutory results for Cineworld 
Group plc “the Group” include the results of 
Cineworld Cinemas and Picturehouse for the 
53 week period ended 1 January 2015 and 
the results of Cinema City for the 44 week 
period ended 1 January 2015.
2 Pro forma results refer to the Group’s 
performance had Cinema City been consolidated 
for the entirety of the period and has been 
calculated by reference to the acquired 
management accounts of Cinema City. For the 
purposes of percentage movements, the impact 
of the 53rd week has been eliminated (week 
ending 1 January 2014, the first week of the prior 
period) and movements in performance have 
been calculated on a constant currency basis.
3 EBITDA is defined as reported in the 
Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss 
as Operating profit before depreciation and 
amortisation, onerous leases and other non-
recurring charges, impairments and reversals 
of impairments, transaction and reorganisation 
costs, profit on disposals of assets.
4 Adjusted profit before tax is calculated by 
adding back amortisation of intangible assets 
(excluding acquired movie distribution rights), 
and certain non-recurring, non-cash items and 
foreign exchange as set out in Note 5. Adjusted 
profit after tax is arrived at by applying an 
effective tax rate to adjusted profit before tax.
5 The 2014 adjusted diluted earnings per 
share and dividend per share have been adjusted 
for the first 48 days of the period to take into 
account the rights issue of 8 for 25 shares on 
14 February 2014.
6 CEE is defined as Central and Eastern 
Europe and includes Poland, Hungary, Romania, 
Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Slovakia.

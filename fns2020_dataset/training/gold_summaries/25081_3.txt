Chairman’s Statement
For the Year Ended 30 September 2010
Impax has sustained its strong track 
record and once again delivered 
substantial growth for shareholders
Since my statement for the year ended 
September 2009, the world economy 
and financial markets have continued to 
recover and the investment management 
sector has emerged leaner and, I hope, 
in a more sober frame of mind. Against 
this backdrop, I am pleased to report 
that Impax has sustained its strong track 
record and once again delivered healthy 
growth for shareholders.
Over Impax’s financial year (the “Period”) 
from 1 October 2009 to 30 September 
2010, assets under discretionary and 
advisory management (“AUM”) 
expanded from £1,263 million to £1,823 
million, an increase of 44 per cent. Since 
the end of the Period we have assumed 
responsibility for management of an 
additional £131 million of assets raised 
by our investment trust focused on 
the Asia-Pacific region and €134 million 
of further capital commitments to our 
second private equity fund. On 31 
December 2010, inclusive of these 
amounts, AUM was £2,251 million. 
Over the past twelve months, the 
backdrop to environmental investing has 
continued to strengthen. Weather 
analysts expect that 2010 will turn out to 
be one of the hottest years on record, 
while extreme weather events in Pakistan 
(floods), Russia (heat waves and 
drought), China (floods) and elsewhere 
reinforced fears that significant climate 
change is already upon us. The trend of 
increasingly unpredictable weather has 
motivated voters and policy makers in 
the European Union, Australia and 
California to press ahead with policy to 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions and 
helped to create a sense of urgency at 
December’s climate conference in 
Cancún, Mexico. Similarly, during 2010 
governments in several emerging market 
economies declared ambitious policies 
to reduce pollution, improve energy 
security and stimulate the growth of 
domestic clean technology sectors. 
Results for the year end and 
proposed dividend 
Turnover for the year was £15,339,000 
(2009: £10,391,000), a 48 per cent 
increase over the year. 
Profit before tax was £5,177,000 (2009: 
£2,473,000, including a charge in respect 
of the Group’s long-term, share-based 
incentive scheme of £552,000). The 
profit included £1,002,000 arising from 
full repayment at face value of a loan 
note issued to the Company in 2004 
when Impax exited from a legacy oil 
business.
The effective tax rate for the Period was 
27 per cent; for the financial year ending 
30 September 2009 the tax rate was 
substantially lower (8 per cent) as a result 
of credits arising from the recognition of 
deferred tax assets.
The Board regards the most relevant 
measure of the year’s earnings to be 
earnings per share (“EPS”) as adjusted 
to exclude the charges for our long-term 
incentive scheme settled from the 
issuance of primary shares. On this 
basis, EPS were 3.50 pence (adjusted), 
a 33 per cent increase compared to last 
year (2.63 pence (adjusted)). The 2010 
EPS result included 0.79 pence 
attributable to the uplift in value of the 
loan note; the 2009 EPS result included 
0.65 pence attributable to one off tax 
benefits. 
The Group’s balance sheet 
also strengthened during the Period and 
cash generation has increased 
significantly. At the end of the financial 
year, shareholders’ equity had increased 
to £16,903,000 (2009: £13,850,000) and 
cash reserves available to shareholders 
were £8,339,000 (2009: £6,694,000). 
The Group remained debt free during the 
Period.
In view of the Group’s strong financial 
position, I am pleased to report that the 
Board recommends an increased 
dividend of 0.60 pence per share (2009: 
0.40 pence per share). The dividend 
proposal will be submitted for formal 
approval by shareholders at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting on 
2 March 2011. If approved, the dividend 
will be paid on or around 11 March 2011. 
The Board does not currently intend to 
recommend the payment of interim 
dividends. 06

Prospects
Over recent years institutional investors 
have generally been disappointed by 
investment returns from mainstream 
products, which have fallen well behind 
levels required to deliver on stated 
objectives. As a consequence, many are 
revisiting their asset allocation models 
and examining whether new strategies 
and asset classes can improve expected 
risk-adjusted returns. In this context, it is 
encouraging that many are reviewing in 
detail the credentials of investment 
portfolios in the environmental sector, 
Impax’s chosen area of focus. Evidence 
continues to build that this sector is 
growing more rapidly than the overall 
economy, and I anticipate that 
allocations to strategies such as those 
run by Impax will grow considerably.

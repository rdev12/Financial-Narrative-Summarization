Consolidated revenue for the year ended 
31 March 2012 was £64.4 million, an 
increase of 2% compared to the previous 
year’s £63.4 million. 
Full year gross profit margin was 48.3% 
(2011 – 46.2%). The increase in gross profit 
margin was primarily a result of changes 
in the product mix of sales in favour of 
higher margin model railway products. This 
reflected improvements in the performance 
of our supply chain. Overheads increased 
year on year, due primarily to the effect of 
variable selling costs increasing in our UK 
concessions and European subsidiaries as 
a result of higher levels of sales, and with 
incremental promotional activity associated 
with the London 2012 Games. 
Pre-tax profit before amortisation of 
intangibles and net foreign exchange 
adjustments on intercompany loans 
(hereafter referred to as underlying 
pre-tax profits) was £4.5 million (2011 – 
£4.4 million) (see note 1). Basic earnings 
per share calculated on underlying pre-tax 
profit (hereafter referred to as underlying 
basic earnings per share) were 9.48p 
(2011 – 8.34p). Statutory pre-tax profit 
was £4.0 million (2011 – £4.1 million) and 
statutory basic earnings per share were 8.19p 
(2011 – 7.50p).
Taxation at £0.8 million (2011 – £1.3 million) 
was 21% of reported profit before tax 
(2011 – 31%). This included a prior year 
deferred tax adjustment of £0.3 million, 
relating to the provision for unrealised profit 
in stock. The taxation figure excluding this 
adjustment was 27%. 
Core Group inventories reduced during the 
year. However, at the year end we were 
carrying stocks of London 2012 merchandise 
valued at £3.3 million in order to service 
the sales to be made in the run-up to and 
during the Games. This resulted in an overall 
increase in stocks at the year end. We expect 
this position to unwind as the London 2012 
inventory is sold. Net debt as at 31 March 
2012 was £6.3 million (2011 – £6.1 million).
Dividend
This has been another year in which 
trading has been challenging. Last year the 
dividend payment was maintained at the 
level of the previous year, notwithstanding 
a reduction in earnings per share. The Board 
recommends that the total dividend for the 
current year be re-aligned to the Group’s 
long term policy of paying 50% of earnings. 
The total dividend has been calculated after 
excluding the impact of the prior year tax 
benefit referred to above and results in a 
recommended dividend of 3.7p per ordinary 
share (2011 – 5.0p). An interim dividend of 
1.7p has already been paid, so the proposed 
final dividend will be 2.0p. In line with the 
notification made in last year’s Report and 
Accounts to this effect, payment of the final 
dividend will be made after the Group’s peak 
working capital requirement for the year has 
passed. The final dividend will therefore be 
paid on 21 December 2012 to shareholders 
on the register at 23 November 2012.
Banking Facilities
The Group has banking facilities of 
£17.5 million in the UK. These facilities 
comprise a £7.5 million amortising Term 
Loan which expires in July 2014 and a 
£10 million Secured Money Market Loan 
which expires in August 2015. The Group 
also has additional facilities of £2.5 million in 
place in its European subsidiaries. Borrowings 
in the year ended 31 March 2012 peaked 
at £15.6 million. The Group remained 
comfortably within all of its covenants during 
the year. 
Business Overview
This has been a further year of challenging 
economic conditions. However we have 
made good progress in a number of key 
areas. In mainland Europe improved supply 
chain performance enabled our European 
business to report increased sales and a 
satisfactory profit. Trading conditions in our 
The Group’s principal business is the design, development, production and

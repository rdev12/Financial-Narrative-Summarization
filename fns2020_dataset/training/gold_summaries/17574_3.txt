YouGov	 serves	 its	 clients	 by	 providing	 research	 insights	 ranging	 from	 changing	 consumer	 opinions	 towards	 brands	 to	 voting	 intentions	 in	 elections	 and	 attitudes	 towards	 social	 and	 commercial	 issues.	 Over	 the	 past	 12	 months	 we	 have	 increased	 our	 range	 of	 clients,	 broadened	 the	 number	 of	 services	 we	 have	 on	 offer	 and	 extended	 our	 geographical	 reach.	 YouGov	 has	 been	 one	 of	 the	 most	 successful	 pioneers	 of	 internet	 based	 r e s e a r c h 	 a n d 	 t h i s 	 i s 	 r e fl e c t e d 	 b y 	 t h e 	 h i g h	
demand	 for	 our	 products	 and	 services	 and	 	 by	 the	 interest	 shown	 by	 potential	 recruits.
Following	our	expansion	during	the	last	year	 and	the	recent	post-balance	sheet	events	 we	now	operate	through	strong	subsidiary	 companies	in	Europe,	North	America	 	 and	the	Middle	East	which	will	allow	us	 	 to	meet	increasingly	multi-national	 requirements	of	our	clients.
Building a stronger business
In	the	past	year	we	have	focused	on	 international	growth	and	strengthening	 	 our	product	offering.
We	 successfully	 integrated	 the	 Siraj	 business	 w h i c h 	 w e 	 a c q u i r e d 	 o n 	 3 0 	 J u l y 	 2 0 0 6 .		 In	 December	 2006,	 we	 acquired	 an	 initial	 32%	 (£3.8m)	 stake	 in	 our	 associate	 	 business	 Polimetrix,	 based	 in	 Palo	 Alto	 	 and	 Washington,	 USA.
In	March	2007	we	launched	a	new	joint	 venture	YouGovCentaur,	a	50:50	joint	 venture	with	Centaur	publishing,	with	33	 t i t l e s	( i n c l u d i n g :	T h e	L a w y e r ,	T h e	E n g i n e e r	
etc)	to	create	a	new	UK	based	market	 research	agency	with	a	focus	on	the	 business-to-business	sector.	 In	April	2007	we	announced	YouGovStone,	 a	5 1 %	j o i nt	v e nt u r e	w i t h	L o n d o n ’ s	‘ Q u e e n		 of	Networking’	Carole	Stone,	weaving	 prominent	 social	 and	 industry	 commentators	 into	specialist	opinion	leader	panels.	 In	addition	we	announced	the	creation	of	 YouGovAlpha,	the	vehicle	we	have	created	 to	service	clients	in	the	investment	industry,	 following	the	mutually	agreed	disbanding	 	 of	YouGovExecution	by	YouGov	and	 Execution,	the	50:50	joint	venture	partners.

Recent events
O n 	 2 7 	 J u l y 	 2 0 0 7 	 w e 	 a n n o u n c e d 	 t h e 	 fi r s t		 in	 a	 series	 of	 transactions;	 our	 German	 expansion	 through	 the	 acquisition	 of	 psychonomics	 AG.	 This	 was	 followed,	 post	 year	 end,	 when	 we	 made	 the	 decision	 to	 acquire	 the	 remaining	 68%	 stake	 in	 Polimetrix,	 o u r 	 U S 	 a s s o c i a t e 	 a n d 	 a c q u i r e d 	 Z a p e r a , 	 a	
business	 based	 in	 several	 countries	 in	 Scandinavia.	 These	 acquisitions	 have	 been	 funded	 through	 a	 share	 placing,	 which	 our	 shareholders	 approved	 on	 3	 September	 2007.	 These	 acquisitions	 will	 allow	 us	 to	 accelerate	 our	 growth	 and	 are	 consistent	 with	 the	 strategy	 we	 outlined	 this	 time	 last	 year	 when	 we	 started	 the	 restructuring	 of	 the	 Group.
Future prospects and outlook
Following	the	successful	acquisitions	in	the	 USA,	Germany	and	Scandinavia,	our	focus	 is	on	the	integration	of	these	businesses	 into	our	Group,	and	the	development	of	 Group	wide	systems	and	products.
We	also	have	numerous	organic	growth	 opportunities	to	pursue	across	the	 	 enlarged	Group	and	will	continue	to	 	 look	at	complementary	acquisitions	 	 that	meet	our	strict	criteria.	 T h e	c u r r e nt	fi n a n c i a l	y e a r	h a s	s t a r t e d	w e l l

that	2007/08	will	be	another	successful	year	 for	YouGov.
Conclusion
We	have	many	exciting	opportunities	ahead	 of	us	and	we	have	a	growing,	talented	and	 energetic	team	of	individuals	driving	and	 supporting	the	Group’s	development.	 I	take	this	opportunity	on	behalf	of	the	Board	 to	thank	all	of	our	teams	for	their	hard	work	 and	I	look	forward	to	our	continued	success	 i n	t h e	y e a r	t o	J u l y	2 0 0 8 .

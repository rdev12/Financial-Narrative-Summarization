 4 Anglo Asian Mining PLC Annual report and accounts 2009
Mining operations 
Our focus during 2009 was channelled towards 
Gedabek, and the building of its mine and 
processing plant. These efforts bore fruit in 
May 2009 when we commenced gold mining 
operations 	 and 	 sold 	 our 	 first 	 gold 	 in 	 July 	 2009. 	
The Company began construction of an open pit 
mine in 2008. This included building infrastructure 
and developing an open pit mine, as well as 
designing and building a conventional heap 
leach pad and processing facility for the recovery 
of gold, copper and silver. It was also the 
Company’s	intention	during	the	first	year	of	
the mine’s operation to revise its JORC compliant 
resource of 15.6 million tonnes of ore grading 
1.4 g/t gold, 0.24% copper and 12.2 g/t silver 
in the indicated and inferred categories. To this 
end we completed Phase I of the Realistic Mineral 
Model Report which indicates upgrades for the 
measured, indicated and inferred gold, copper 
and silver metal contents of at least 50%. 
We expect the JORC compliant report to be 
completed by the end of July 2010 with the 
more detailed Phase II study to follow at the 
end	of	the	year	after	further	in-fill	drilling	has	
been completed. 
As is often the case, there were some technical 
problems	experienced	during	the	start-up	of	
the mine, namely at the processing facility. 
These included the operational consistency 
of the secondary and tertiary crushers, which 
curtailed production, as well as geological issues 
pertaining to the location of the leach pads. 
Accordingly, Anglo Asian implemented a 
number of initiatives in July and August 2009 
to rectify these problems, expand production 
a n d 	 i m p r o v e 	 e f fi c i e n c i e s . 	 T h e s e 	 i n i t i a t i v e s 	 i n c l u d e d	
installing two new cone crushers to improve 
operational	consistency	which	were	fitted	and	
completed at the end of September 2009. 
Anglo Asian also installed an additional tertiary 
cone crusher and sourced a reconditioned one 
that can be introduced as a standby for the 
secondary cone crusher to increase the plant’s 
operational	flexibility .	
W e	continued	to	encounter	difficulties	during	
the installation of these new cone crushers and 
also had ongoing problems with the stacker 
that affected levels of ore on the leach pad. 
These	difficulties	were	principally	the	result	
of unexpectedly high moisture content within 
the ore fed to the crushers. Subsequently, 
the Company revised its production forecasts 
to	25,000	ounces	of	gold	in	its	first	full	year	
of production to June 2010 from the initial 
70,000 ounces of gold. Since that time, we 
have experienced increasing gold production and 
as a result, we have already exceeded our revised 
p r o d u c t i o n 	 t a r g e t 	 f o r 	 o u r 	 fi r s t 	 y e a r 	 o f 	 o p e r a t i o n	
with production from July 2009 to April 2010 
totalling 30,323 ounces of gold. The table on 
page 5 illustrates monthly gold production. 
Our new stacker system will begin operating 
in late May 2010 and further increases in 
plant availability and production are expected. 
Chief Executive’s review
Our focus during 2009 was 
channelled towards Gedabek, 
and the building of its mine 
and processing plant. These 
efforts bore fruit in May 2009 
when we commenced gold 
mining operations and sold 
our first gold in July 2009. 
 Summary
  Gold production at Gedabek continuing to increase quarter 
on	quarter	as	efficiencies	at	the	mine	further	improve
  SART processing plant to facilitate the recovery of the copper and 
silver dissolved in the leaching solution completed February 2010 – 
expected to be fully operational by September 2010

Table 2 overleaf summarises levels of dry ore 
which have been transferred to the leach pad 
on a monthly basis since April 2009. In order 
to improve economic recovery, blending of high 
and low grade ore has been carried out in a 
ratio that will increase tonnes whilst maintaining 
the grade quality. 
The weather will always play a role in the running 
of operations given our location. Over the 
winter months we experienced extremely cold 
conditions, which resulted in the freezing of 
our solution application pipes. However we 
have now purchased below surface drippers 
which will be installed before next winter. 
We are now moving into the wet season, 
which creates its own challenges. In anticipation 
of this we have been building bigger drainage 
channels around the leach pad and increased 
the surge capacity of our solution storage ponds, 
although the fact that no ore was delivered to 
the leach pad in June 2009 was due to a lack 
of capacity on the pad. 
Post period end, we were delighted to commence 
the new SART process, which facilitates the 
recovery of the copper dissolved in the leaching 
solution. The copper is recovered in the form 
of a precipitated copper sulphide concentrate 
by -product,	which	also	contains	silver	with	
commercial value. Initial results appear 
promising. Following process optimisation, 
a plant automation system will be installed. 
The plant capacity is 1,800 tonnes of copper 
concentrate per year although the amount 
produced will depend on ore mineralogy and 
process	efficiencies.	Initial	assay	results	show	
that the copper concentrate contains 60–70% 
copper and 4,000 to 6,000 g/t of silver although 
it should be noted that the high silver content 
may be the result of an anomaly caused by 
the silver build up in the solution prior to the 
start up of the SART plant. During March and 
April 2010 we produced approximately 85 dry 
tonnes of copper concentrate using circa 30% 
of the plant’s capacity. The Company is in the 
process of evaluating options for the sale of 
copper/silver concentrate.
On more practical issues surrounding the running 
of the mine, health and safety systems remain 
at the forefront of our agenda. We abide by 
strict health and safety criteria and our record 
in this respect remains excellent with no major 
or serious accidents during 2009 and to date 
in 2010. 
Environmental principles are also high on 
our agenda and the mine is constructed to 
the highest environmental standards. In terms 
of power and water, we are using our own 
diesel-powered	generators	and	water	supply	
is readily available from nearby streams. 
On the same theme, we were delighted to 
announce that in March 2010, the Company 
was 	 awarded 	 the 	 following 	 certificates:

before,	we	foresee	a	few	teething	issues	in	its	first	months	of	operation.	
We expect the SART process to be fully operational by September 2010.

Chief Executive’s review continued
Mining operations continued
We have good relationships with our labour 
force of approximately 300 people including 
a local management team, Azeri mining 
and earthworks contractors and experienced 
operations personnel from surrounding countries. 
In order to accommodate our staff we have 
built a permanent mine camp at Gedabek. 
We also have a highly active community policy 
aimed at enfranchising the local community 
and assisting in their economic advancement. 
To date, Anglo Asian has carried out several 
community development projects including 
providing seminars and training on beekeeping 
and we have a pilot programme in place to 
give soft loans to beekeeping families to start 
in business. Anglo Asian has also provided the 
expertise and material to enable two villages 
local to the Gedabek mine to obtain fresh water, 
as well as repairing a bridge and a medical 
facility in one of the villages. Additionally, we 
have set up a training centre in Gedabek and 
have partnered with two international Non 
Government Organisations (‘NGOs’) to offer 
local residents vocational training such as welding 
and business development courses such as 
beekeeping, tailoring, computer skills and 
business	start-up.	The	centre	is	also	used	for	
an internet café at Gedabek, which gives ongoing 
training in the use of computers and free use 
of the internet for the local community. 
Exploration
Although we are currently focused on 
development and successful production 
at Gedabek, exploration still remains central 
to	our	long-term	strategy	of	increasing	our	
production	profile.	Our	portfolio	includes	
three	Contract	Areas	covering	1,062	sq	km:	
Gedabek, Ordubad and Gosha, which run 
across the Tethyan Tectonic Belt, one of the 
world’s	significant	copper	and	gold	bearing	
areas. We believe that with further exploration, 
our exploration portfolio has the potential 
to replicate Gedabek and generate further 
producing entities. Additionally, we hope 
to develop our 900 sq km prospects in three 
additional Contract Areas located in the 
region in Azerbaijan occupied by Armenia 
when the political situation permits. 
Gedabek
Exploration activities within the Gedabek 
Contract Area continue. During the initial 
development of the mine, it became evident 
that in a number of areas the ore had higher 
grades than forecast by the original ore body 
model and there are also extensions beyond the 
predicted 	 final 	 pit 	 boundaries. 	 Ore 	 mined 	 as 	 of 	
31 March 2010 amounted to 468,000 tonnes 
at a grade of 4.18 g/t. Out of this amount, 
212,000 tonnes with an average grade of 
3.0 g/t was not included in the original reserve 
estimations. In order to help clarify the situation, 
we enlisted the help of SGS Mineral Services 
and, at the end of August 2009, one of its 
consultants visited Gedabek to review its 
geology and existing drill logs. Subsequently,

to create a more accurate ore body model of the Gedabek deposit. 
Initial results of Phase I of the Realistic Mineral Resources Model Report were 
announced in April 2010 and indicated upgrades for the measured, indicated 
and inferred gold, copper and silver metal contents of at least 50% from the 
original JORC compliant mineral resource statement of 702,000 ounces of gold, 37,500 tonnes of copper and 
6,100,000 ounces of silver. The mineral resources were estimated by accessing, reviewing, validating and processing 
the whole geological and chemical information from 141 exploration diamond and reverse circulation (29 diamond, 
34 reverse circulation and 78 combined) drill holes and 262 production blast holes. 
The	report	represents	the	first	phase	of	SGS’s	work;	the	second	phase	of	the	project	will	involve	in-fill	drilling	to	
increase the reliability of the results obtained from the original drill holes. This work is expected to be completed 
by	late	2010	and	will	increase	the	Board’s	confidence	in	the	new	resource	evaluations.

a	re-modelling	and	a	geometallurgical	study	
was commissioned to create a more accurate 
ore body model of the Gedabek deposit. 
Initial results of Phase I of the Realistic Mineral 
Resources Model Report were announced in 
April 2010 and indicated upgrades for the 
measured, indicated and inferred gold, copper 
and silver metal contents of at least 50% from 
the JORC compliant mineral resources statement 
provided by SRK in 2006. The mineral resources 
were estimated by accessing, reviewing, validating 
and processing the whole geological and 
chemical information from 141 exploration 
diamond and reverse circulation (29 diamond, 
34 reverse circulation and 78 combined) 
drillholes and 262 production blastholes. 
It is important to note that the report 
represents	the	first	phase	of	SGS’s	work;	
the second phase of the project will involve 
in-fill	drilling	to	increase	the	reliability	of	the	
results obtained from the original drill holes. 
This work is expected to be completed by late 
2010	and	will	increase	the	Board’s	confidence	
in the new resource evaluations. The results 
of the report are therefore subject to revision. 
We also continued exploration work at Maarif, 
another property on the Gedabek Contract 
Area. This included pioneer drilling following 
geochemical and geophysical surveys. This will 
be followed by analysis and interpretation of 
the results in the second half of 2010. 
Gosha 
The 300 sq km Gosha Contract Area is situated 
50	km	north-west	of	Gedabek	and	contains	
t h r e e 	 p r o s p e c t s : 	 G o s h a , 	 I t k i r l a n 	 a n d 	 M u n d u g l u .	
In April 2009 the Company was granted a two 
year extension by the Government of Azerbaijan 
to continue exploration in this area for precious 
and base metals until 13 April 2011.

used in tandem with additional data that 
we have collected, will form the basis for an 
extensive exploration programme. Ultimately, 
we	aim	to	define	new	resources	and	replicate	
our success at Gedabek with the development 
of an underground mining operation. 
Gosha has more than 6 km of exploration audits 
from	the	Soviet-era,	of	which	the	richest	
mineralisation zone has a prospect of narrow 
vein type renegade gold deposit. In addition 
to	this	zone,	which	according	to	Soviet-era	
studies contains approximately 3.2 tonnes of 
gold with average grade of 14.0 g/t, there are 
several other vein type mineralisation zones. 
In total according to these studies, Gosha has 
a resource of 8 tonnes of gold in the indicated 
and inferred categories. 
Additionally, assay results from extensive 
samplings completed by the Company on the 
richest mineralisation zone indicate a close 
match with previous works during the 
Soviet-era.	W ith	this	in	mind	we	launched	
a new exploration programme for 2010 
including diamond core drilling. Furthermore 
a contract for an extension of a new audit was 
signed with a local company for 2010, in order 
to cross cut the ore vein at a lower depth. 
Ordubad
The 462 sq km Ordubad Contract Area in the 
Nakhchivan region contains numerous targets 
including Shakardara, Piyazbashi, Misdag, 
Agyurt, Shalala and Diakchay, which are all 
located within a 5km radius. In April 2009 
we were granted a two year extension to 
continue exploration in this area for precious 
and base metals until 13 April 2011.
During	2009	based	on	previous	Soviet-era	
studies, we launched a core drilling programme 
at the Misdag, Shalala and Diakchay targets. 
These results did not correlate to the data 
indicated	in	the	Soviet-era	reports.	In	light	
of	this,	we	have	modified	our	exploration	
strategy at the Ordubad Contract Area and 
started a new regional geological survey over 
the area, in addition to limited exploration 
activities at the Agyurt target area with a view 
to extending the licence period. Consequently, 
we have made a decision to write off $773,180 
in exploration and evaluation expenditure 
attributable to Misdag, Shalala and Diakchay 
mining properties as well as writing down the 
remaining $5,000,000 mining rights attributable 
to Ordubad Contract Area.
Product Sharing Agreement (‘PSA’)
The Company has exclusive rights, through 
one of its subsidiaries, RV Investment Group 
Services LLC, to explore and extract all minerals 
from all of the Contract Areas through a PSA 
with the Government of Azerbaijan. This also 
provides Anglo Asian with exclusive rights to 
data	from	the	Soviet-era	covering	these	areas.	
Under the terms of the PSA, which is modelled 
on Azerbaijan’s internationally recognised oil 
industry practices, the Government of Azerbaijan 
is entitled to 51% of commercial products 
from each mine after deducting the quantities 
of commercial products necessary to enable 
the Company to recover its operating costs, 
capital costs and imputed interest. Costs 
allowable as operating, capital and imputed 
interest	for	each	mine	are	defined	under	the	
terms of the PSA agreement. Prior to the point 
at which the Company has recovered all its 
carried forward, unrecovered operating, capital 
and imputed interest costs, the Company is 
able to recover up to a maximum of 75% of 
the imputed revenue from each mine. Up until 
the time Anglo Asian has recovered all its carried 
forward, unrecovered costs, the Government 
of Azerbaijan effectively takes 12.75% (being 
51% of the balancing 25%) of commercial 
products of each mine with the Company 
taking 87.25%.

Carr’s Milling Industries PLC
Annual Report & Accounts 2006
Chairman’s Statement
Richard
Inglewood
It gives me great satisfaction to report to
Shareholders that Carr’s has once again raised
adjusted pre-tax profits to record levels, with a
9.2% increase to £7.3m. Growth in our existing
business and expansion in Germany reflects a
good performance from all three divisions. 
FINANCIAL OVERVIEW
The annual figures have, for the first time, been prepared under
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) and those for 2005
have been restated on a comparable basis.
Revenue in the 52 weeks to 2 September 2006 rose 26.3% to £242.6m
(53 weeks to 3 September 2005: £192.1m), partially due to the inclusion
for the full year of the animal feed business acquired by our associate from
Pye in July 2005 and of the flour business acquired by Carr's Flour Mills
from Meneba in November 2004.
Profit before tax was £6.3m (2005: £10.4m). Profit before tax
excluding non-recurring items (principally the £4.1m gain on disposal of
the Bendall’s factory in the previous year) and amortisation of intangible
assets increased by 9.2% to £7.3m (2005: £6.7m). Adjusted earnings
per share, on a similar basis, rose 17.3% to 59.7p (2005: 50.9p) - an
eighth successive annual increase. Basic earnings per share was 51.0p
(2005: 92.1p).
Operating cash flow in the year was strong. Cash generated from
operations of £11.1m compared with £6.7m in the previous period. Net
debt reduced to £13.9m (2005: £14.9m), representing gearing of 68.3%
(2005: 73.9%). The net interest charge of £1.0m (2005: £1.2m) was
covered 7.9 times (2005: 6.7 times) by adjusted Group operating profit.
The results are considered in more detail in the Chief Executive’s Review.
DIVIDENDS
Reflecting the Group’s progressive dividend policy, its good performance
and its encouraging prospects, the Board is proposing an increase in the
final dividend of 13.6% to 12.5p per share. Along with the interim dividend
of 5.5p per share, paid in May 2006 (2005: 5.0p), this makes a total
dividend for the period of 18.0p per share, an increase of 12.5% on last
period’s 16.0p. The final dividend, if approved by Shareholders, will be paid
on 19 January 2007 to Shareholders on the register at the close of 03

DEVELOPMENT OF CARR’S AGRICULTURE BUSINESS
In anticipation of a decline in divisional profit in the face of a further
deterioration in the UK market for agriculture, during the period Carr’s
made various changes to its animal feed business.
As reported in the Interim Announcement of 26 April 2006, to address a
noticeable reduction in demand and serious industry over-production of
compound and blended feed, our associate’s compound feed mills at
Blackburn (Lancashire), Penrith (Cumbria), and Shrewsbury (Shropshire)
were closed. The remaining Pye animal feed business, is now fully
integrated into Carrs Billington Agriculture Operations. The integration of
the sales teams, systems and product ranges proved challenging, and it is
to the credit, and demonstrates the strength, of our management teams
that this is complete and the business is focussed on the challenges
ahead.
The animal feed business expanded into Wales with the formation in
September 2005 of a new joint venture company, Bibby Agriculture,
together with Wynnstay Group and Welsh Feed Producers; Carr's
Billington Agriculture Sales is a 50% shareholder. Bibby Agriculture 
traded profitably.
Since 2001, we have sold our Crystalyx low moisture feed blocks through
a large distributor in Germany, Agravis. Volumes have steadily increased
and reached a stage where it was viable to build a manufacturing plant in
Germany using our patented manufacturing process. A new company,
Crystalyx Products GmbH, jointly owned by Carr’s and Agravis, was formed
and the new plant was commissioned in January 2006. In the early
months, new sales outlets have been sourced and we are encouraged by
the performance to date.
In the US, we replaced a production line at our factory in Belle Fourche,
South Dakota, completing in November 2006. This new line incorporates
the new technology developed by our own engineering staff and is
designed to meet the expected increased demand.
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
The Pye acquisition in July 2005 nearly doubled Carr’s compound and
blended feed volumes. In the period there was a further deterioration in the
UK market for agriculture, including the Group’s principal trading area of
North West England and South West Scotland, as a result of delays in
farmers’ receiving subsidies (in the form of the initial Single Farm
Payment), the low price of milk and animals feeding outside in the mild
winter weather. In addition, margins were squeezed due to higher energy
costs. Consequently, Agriculture’s contribution reduced, as forecast in the
Interim Announcement.
The Meneba acquisitions, comprising mills at Kirkcaldy in Fife and Maldon
in Essex, more than doubled the size of Carr’s flour business, previously
comprising a single mill at Silloth in Cumbria. Demand for flour from both
bakers and biscuit producers was high throughout the period and, together
with the success in winning new customers, the three mills operated to
near capacity throughout the period. Accordingly, a substantial increase in
Food’s contribution to the Group’s profit before non-recurring items and
amortisation was achieved, as anticipated in the Interim Announcement.
The Bendalls engineering business re-located to its new factory in July
2005 and has benefited from the improved facilities and production layout.
The three engineering businesses made good progress in 2006.
BOARD
In September 2005, Alastair Wannop was appointed a non-executive
Director, bringing non-executive Directors to three and independent non-
executive Directors to two, and I succeeded David Newton as Chairman. 
As in previous years, the Board reviewed best practice Corporate
Governance policies and procedures and made changes to ensure the
Group remains where appropriate compliant, bearing in mind its size, with
the Combined Code.
OUTLOOK
In the 52 weeks to 2 September 2006, the performance of the business
continued to benefit from the strength of the management teams at the
Group’s operational activities. This attribute has enabled the Group to
continue its progress despite the difficulties posed by increased costs,
particularly energy, and the general trading environment. We expect these
challenges to continue into the current year. However, I can report that
trading in the opening weeks is in line with management’s expectations but
with the high cost increases being experienced the management will be
challenged to continue the Group’s growth.

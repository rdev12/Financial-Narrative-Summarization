 For the second year in a row, our principal
investment markets (as measured by the
MSCI Emerging Markets Index, MXEF)
grew by in excess of 20%. Funds under
management (“FuM”) were US$5.82
billion (£3.54 billion) at 31st May 2011
(2010: US$4.38 billion or £3.01 billion),
representing a 33% increase in US$ terms
and an 18% increase in sterling terms. This
reflects net new client monies as well as out
performance over and above MXEF , which
increased by 29% over the same period
(31st May 2010 to 31st May 2011).
As anticipated by our investment
management team, emerging markets since
our year end have essentially tracked down
as investors, domestic and international,
have settled for the (almost) risk-free
returns available on cash as a result of a
series of rate rises in the principal emerging
markets. As at 31st August 2011, MXEF
has fallen 10.6% since our year end.
FUM were US$5.22 billion at 31st August
2011, a fall of 10.3% over the figure at
31st May 2011.
Results  
Revenue for the year to 31st May 2011
(being the fees derived from the Group’s
management charges on FuM) increased by
22% to £36.5 million (2010: £30.0 million) .
Profit before tax increased by 27% to 
£13.1 million (2010: £10.4 million) net of 
a one-off charge of £0.4 million relating to
the costs of our upgrade to the main market
of the London Stock Exchange (2010: nil).
Basic profit per share, after a tax charge of
£4.4 million, representing 33% of pre-tax
profits (2010: £3.4 million, representing
33% of pre-tax profits), increased by 23%
to 35.1p (2010: 28.5p). Fully diluted profit
per share increased by 26% to 34.0p
(2010: 26.9p). Cash and cash equivalents
at the year-end were £6.1 million (2010:
£4.8 million).
Dividends
In line with the Group’s policy of paying
dividends that are approximately 1.5 times
covered by profit per share, the Board is
recommending a final dividend for the
year to 31st May 2011 of 16p per share
(2010: 15p) to be paid some four weeks
earlier than last year on 21st October
2011 to shareholders on the register on
7th October 2011. This would bring the
total for the year, including the interim
dividend of 8p paid on 28th February
2011 (2010: 7p), to 24p (2010: 22p),
representing an increase of 9%. The level
of payout this year is covered 1.46 times
by basic profit per share compared to 
1.30 times last year.
Upgrade to the Main Market
At the end of October 2010, the
Company’s ordinary shares were delisted
from AIM, where they had traded for 
four and a half years, and admitted to the
Official List of the UK Listing Authority
and the London Stock Exchange’s main
market. The Board believed that this
natural progression would result in a 
wider potential investor universe for 
City of London Investment Group shares. 
This has proved to be the case in the 
10 months since, both for individual
investors (who can now hold our shares 
in ISAs) and for institutional investors 
(a number of whom are unable to invest
in AIM listed entities). 
Chairman’s statement
“Despite the volatility in the
markets in which we operate,
we are confident that our
investment process can continue
to produce good returns for our
clients and shareholders.”

Chairman’s statement
Continued
Diversification
We are seeing significant progress in two
of our diversification products. The first is
Natural Resources where the Group has
recently won a number of mandates to 
be funded over the next few months. 
The second is developed market closed-
end funds where we have recently won 
a significant mandate which we hope 
will be the first of many, based upon the
consistent outperformance demonstrated
by this product. In both cases there 
is significant consultant interest in 
the products.
From 1st June 2011, the Group has
employed two additional marketers,
bringing the total team to three people.
Our aim is to attract new monies which
for the most part earn significantly higher
margins for the Group because they do
not attract the marketing commission
charged by the Group’s former third
party marketing agency. We hope to see
further increases in the net margins
earned by the Group as the expanded
internal marketing team gains traction
and we focus increasingly on the
diversification products.
Board and management
Post our year end, on 3rd June 2011, the
Group announced the appointment of 
an additional non-executive Director, 
Rian Dartnell. Rian is a US citizen and
resident and is Chief Investment Officer
for Granite Associates, responsible for
setting and implementing the firm’s
investment strategy and for managing 
the investment team. He joined Granite
Associates in 2001, prior to which he 
held a number of senior international
investment management appointments,
latterly with Global Asset Management.
Rian knows both our investment and
client markets well and I am sure that 
his experience and knowledge will benefit
the Board’s decisions. I welcome him 
to the Group. 
The Board has carefully considered the
important matter of Barry Olliff’s
succession. He has the roles of both 
Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and
Chief Investment Officer (CIO), and he
has already told shareholders that he
wishes to be able to retire in 2015 – his
well publicised share sale programme is a
preparation for this event. He now holds
13.5% of the shares. Working closely
with Barry the Board decided that Doug
Allison, who is currently Chief Financial
Officer (CFO) and has been with the
company 14 years, will make an excellent
successor CEO and intend to make this
appointment in 2013. The Board is also
discussing with Barry the best way to
ensure that his role as CIO is passed on 
so as to ensure the continuation of the
Group’s successful investment performance. 
Staff
During the year great demands have been
made on the staff in all areas of the
Group, reflecting the challenging markets
in which we trade and the need to be
properly equipped to maintain the highest
standards of professionalism. I heartily
thank them all for their hard work,
initiative and loyalty.
Outlook
This year has already felt the effects of the
economic turbulence resulting from the
difficulties of Governments to manage
their economies satisfactorily. We believe
that our core products together with our
newer strategies will place us in a relatively
good position to confront the future
uncertainties. Despite the volatility in the
markets in which we operate, we are
confident that our investment process can
continue to produce good returns for our
clients and shareholders.
I will update shareholders on progress at
the time of the AGM, which will be held
on 3rd October 2011.

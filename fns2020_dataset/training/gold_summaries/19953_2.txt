FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS Leading US health 
and life insurer
For disaster recovery, recovered data 
has to be synchronised with live 
“production” data across its cluster 
of servers. 
In addition there is an ingest (capture) and 
analysis use case – data is continuously 
captured and continually accessed, with 
WANdisco’s Fusion ensuring that neither 
activity impinges on the other. 
Fusion has achieved results not 
possible with open source Hadoop. 
The company sets great store by 
Fusion achieving this without adding 
significant workload to computing 
operations… and concluding the 
implementation in under a month.
FIND OUT MORE ABOUT OUR STRATEGY 
ON PAGE 14
Fusion sits in front of our cluster, and replicates without having to do reads from inside the 
cluster. WANdisco’s Fusion adds almost zero overhead to our production cluster, whereas if 
you use “DistCp” as part of open source Hadoop, you are going to put extra file system load 
on your cluster and that is going to impact you.
We ingest all of our raw data, then we transform it and, from there, we use Fusion to replicate 
it into our analytics cluster. As quick as we’re ingesting it, it becomes available for analytics.
We do extensive analytics algorithms that are very invasive to our operational cluster. 
Without Fusion that would have been a very difficult problem to solve. We would have had 
to scale our operational cluster to an extreme amount to be able to run queries at the same 
time as ingests and transformations. It would have scaled to a point that was untenable.
We were able to implement Fusion from start to finish without a proof of concept, 
and without a whole lot of upfront planning, in less than four weeks.

 o2o plc Report and Accounts 2008
D J Callear Chairman
I am pleased to report improved results for 2008 in line with 
our expectations. Challenging economic conditions, including 
unprecedented product cost pressures, were balanced by 
the positive impacts of our business restructuring and the 
acquisitions of TripleArc plc and Accord Office Supplies Limited 
and, given market conditions, margins have held up well across 
the Group. Following these acquisitions and the more recent 
document services partnership, o2o is now better positioned to 
drive forward its business with a more comprehensive range of 
products and services and a wider customer base.

o2o plc Report and Accounts 2008 2 o2o plc Report and Accounts 2008  Results
Group revenue was £181.0m, up from 
£167.9m in 2007. Underlying profit 
before tax at £12.1m was up from £1 1.6m 
in 2007 , before exceptional and non-
recurring costs of £1.8m (2007: £2.3m), nil 
share option charges (2007: £0.2m) and 
amortisation of intangibles relating to 
acquisitions in the year of £0.6m (2007: nil). 
Profit before tax, after all such charges, was 
£9.6m (2007: £9.0m) and profit after tax 
was £6.6m (2007: £6.3m). Basic earnings 
per share were 18.5p (2007: 17.4p).
Cash and net debt
Net cash generated from operating 
activities declined to £2.2m (2007: £5.4m). 
Net cash of £5.3m has been injected into 
the acquired businesses as a consequence 
of anticipated working capital movements 
together with a related interest charge 
of £1.3m (2007: nil). Accordingly, without 
the acquisitions, £8.8m would have been 
generated from operating activities.
Net debt was £29.7m at 31 December 2008 
(2007: £6.4m net cash), reflecting the cost 
of the acquisitions of £34.1m and working 
capital support post acquisition, net of 
repayments made.
Committed borrowing facilities total 
£45.0m. The facilities, which are committed 
until April 2013, comprise a term loan 
(£25.0m) and an invoice discounting 
arrangement (up to £20.0m) on which we 
are charged interest at 1.1% over LIBOR and 
0.9% over bank base rate, respectively.
The first repayment of £2.5m on the term 
loan is not due until April 2010 and will be 
repaid out of operating cashflows. Financial 
covenants are applied to the committed 
facilities with which the Group has complied 
to date with significant headroom.
Dividends
The Board recommends a final dividend 
of 7.5p per share (2007: 6.8p), which, if 
approved at the annual general meeting 
(AGM), will be paid on 12 May 2009 
to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 14 April 2009. 
Combined with the interim dividend paid 
in November 2008, this makes a total 
dividend per share of 11.0p (2007: 10.0p) 
and amounts to a distribution of £3.9m 
(2007: £3.6m). The total dividend, paid 
and payable for the year is covered by 
earnings 1.7 times (2007: 1.7 times).
Review of operations 
In last year’s annual report we stated 
both our intention to continue to 
improve business efficiency and our 
commitment to expand our routes to 
market through acquisition. In the year 
ended 31 December 2008 we achieved 
this by further streamlining activities and 
by the acquisitions of two complementary 
businesses: AccessPlus (through its parent 
company, TripleArc plc) and Accord Office 
Supplies Limited (Accord). In addition 
Banner Document Services Limited (BDS), 
our partnership with Shred Easy Limited 
(Shred Easy), which commenced trading 
subsequent to the end of the financial year, 
will add a further business critical service 
to our product portfolio. We believe that 
these achievements provide a platform 
for a more resilient business and increased 
shareholder value. Other than our option to 
acquire Shred Easy, we have no immediate 
plans for further material acquisitions.
Operationally, we have structured the 
Group around two broad areas of activity 
– managed procurement and business 
critical services. This new structure 
operates under four trading brands: 
Banner Business Services and Accord 
(managed procurement); and AccessPlus 
and Banner Document Services (business 
critical services). All are supported by o2o’s 
integrated supply chain. 
Trading volumes and margins across the 
Group held up well during the year, given 
market conditions. The substantial pressure 
from product cost increases attributable to 
energy, paper pulp and steel price inflation 
and, more recently, a weaker sterling was 
dealt with by determined negotiation with 
suppliers and passing unavoidable increases 
through to customers.
Year on year revenue in Banner Business 
Services (BBS), our core contract 
management business, grew by a modest 
2.6% (excluding the year on year decline 
of £18.1m in MoD revenues) as the 
business focused on contract retention 
and mitigating the impact on 2008 of the 
withdrawal from MoD supply in the latter 
part of 2007 .
A full review of Group operations is included 
in the Chief Executive’s Review on pages 4–1 1.
Board changes
I welcome Chris Batterham to the Board as 
non-executive Director and Chairman of 
the Audit Committee. Chris is a Chartered 
Accountant with significant experience as 
a finance director in the business services 
sector. He joined the Board on 27 June 2008, 
following the resignation of Peter Bertram 
on 24 April 2008, as reported last year. 
Employees
Once again, I would like to recognise the 
contribution to the success of o2o made 
by its employees and thank them for 
their commitment.
Outlook
Following the integration of our recent 
acquisitions, we are focused on growing the 
enlarged Group, making it more efficient 
and improving its cash generating ability. 
The various initiatives we have introduced 
and the actions we have taken continue 
to have a positive effect on the business. 
However, at the same time and like 
others, we are faced with more uncertain 
economic circumstances than we have 
seen before. 
Through acquisition and partnership, o2o 
has succeeded in expanding its routes to 
market and this provides a more resilient 
business base from which it can build. 
The Group has a high concentration of 
customers under formal contracts and 
other supply arrangements in both the 
private and public sector. Further, we will 
continue to seek and find ways to improve 
the efficiency of its operations. Accordingly, 
whilst we acknowledge the continuing 
general economic uncertainty, we are 
confident that o2o is now positioned as 
well as it has ever been to drive forward 
its business.
AGM
The AGM will be held at the Company’s 
head office, St Crispins, Duke Street, 
Norwich on 23 April 2009 at 3.00 p.m. 
Notice of the AGM together with the 
proxy forms for use at the AGM, is being 
circulated with these financial statements.

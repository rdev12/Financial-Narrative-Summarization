 Chairman’s Statement
This year's Annual Report marks a
milestone in the development of
office2office. It covers the period in
which office2office made its debut on
the London Stock Exchange as well
as maintaining its track record of
growth in both sales and profit before
exceptional items.
RESULTS
Turnover grew by £16.2 million (12.9%) to
£141.8 million (2003: £125.6 million) with all
areas of the Group performing strongly.
Operating profit before goodwill amortisation
and exceptional costs, but after FRS20 costs
of £0.2 million, increased to £10.1 million
(2003: £7.7 million). FRS20 share option costs
related to the management share option
schemes and SAYE scheme. Goodwill
amortisation amounted to £0.7 million 
(2003: £0.7 million) and the exceptional costs
incurred in the flotation process were 
£3.3 million. After reflecting such charges,
operating profit was £6.1 million 
(2003: £6.9 million).
Profit after taxation before goodwill
amortisation and exceptional costs was 
£6.6 million (2003: £4.8 million). Profit after
taxation, after reflecting such charges, was
£2.8 million (2003: £4.0 million).
Net cash inflow from operating activities after
exceptional costs was £10.9 million 
(2003: £9.9 million). Net debt was eliminated,
with net cash in hand at 31 December 2004
of £0.5 million (2003: net debt £7.2 million).
Fully diluted earnings per Ordinary share
before goodwill amortisation and exceptional
costs were 16.6p (2003: 12.0p). After goodwill
amortisation and exceptional costs, fully
diluted earnings per Ordinary share were 5.6p
(2003: 9.7p).
DIVIDEND
The Directors recommend a final dividend in
respect of the year ended 31 December 2004
on Ordinary shares of 4.2p (2003: nil) per
share, amounting to £1.5 million. If authorised
at the Annual General Meeting, the dividend
will be paid on 9 May 2005 to shareholders
on the share register at the close of business
on 8 April 2005.
4 office2office Annual Report 2004 TRADING
Trading is discussed in detail in the Chief
Executive’s Review. In summary, despite a
competitive office supplies market, the Group
continued to diversify its customer base with
net customer wins. In particular, following the
largest customer contract re-tender since
flotation, we have retained a broadly similar
share of the significant NHS Logistics
business to that previously held. 
STOCK EXCHANGE LISTING
On 29th June 2004 the Group's shares
started trading on the main market of the
London Stock Exchange. The flotation
provided £5 million of cash, before costs,
which has allowed the Group to redeem all
outstanding Preference shares (£3.0 million)
and apply the balance for general working
capital purposes.
BOARD AND GOVERNANCE
In June, we welcomed Jim Cohen and 
Peter Bertram to the office2office Board as
independent non-executive Directors. They
bring a wealth of experience, which will be
invaluable to the Group over the coming
years. Jim Cohen is currently a main board
Director of Balfour Beatty plc. Peter Bertram,
a Chartered Accountant, was CEO of Azlan
Group plc prior to its sale in 2003 and has a
number of other non-executive Directorships.
EMPLOYEES 
Ultimately, the key to our success lies in the
enthusiasm, commitment and skills of those
who work for office2office. I would like to
acknowledge that contribution and to thank
everyone for their support and dedication
during an eventful year. We shall strive to
continue the development of an environment
where our staff find job fulfilment and success.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
The Annual General Meeting will take place 
at the Group’s head office, St Crispins, 
Duke Street, Norwich on Wednesday 
20 April 2005 at 10.30 am. Notices detailing
the ordinary and special business to be
conducted together with the proxy forms are
circulated with these financial statements.
OUTLOOK 
The success of our strategy for growth and
profitability provided the platform for the
Group to debut successfully on the London
Stock Exchange. Throughout 2004 we have
continued to record net customer wins, mainly
in the private sector, which expand and
diversify our customer base to underpin future
growth. In addition, recent successful contract
renewals have demonstrated office2office’s
competitive ability.
The Board will continue to focus on the
fundamentals that have created success 
so far.
We intend to develop our customer service,
procurement and logistics strengths to
enhance our position in the bid to win new
customers, to renew existing customer
contracts as they expire and, ultimately, to
manage the impact of proposals to further
consolidate public sector contracts.
Accordingly, while recognising that we do
have challenges to face, we look forward to
2005 with measured confidence.

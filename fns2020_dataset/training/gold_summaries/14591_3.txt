Outlook
2007 was a successful year, in which the company delivered 
a return on sales in excess of 15%. Our broad spread of
geographies and end user markets, and strong product offering,
ensure that we are well placed to maintain good progress despite
an economic outlook which is less certain. The current year has
started well, with encouraging prospects across the multiple
industries and regions we serve.

Our business at a glance
Saga has become one of the UK’s most trusted 
businesses by providing customers with excellent 
products and leading customer service for more than 
60 years. We have successfully used our reputation 
and the brand’s strength to broaden our product 
offering and expand into new areas where we know 
the Saga approach to quality and service will succeed. 
From a hotel in Folkestone we have evolved into the 
leading provider of high-quality insurance, financial 
services, travel, healthcare and media products. We 
are the only commercial organisation of scale in the 
UK that focuses on the fast-growing over 50s market.

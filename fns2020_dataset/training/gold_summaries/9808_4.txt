 Marshalls plc     Annual Report 2013 4
Summary Highlights
The action Marshalls has 
taken over recent years to reduce 
the cost base and net debt, whilst
maintaining operational flexibility,
combined with a range of growth
initiatives, means the business is 
well positioned to take full 
advantage of improving 
market conditions.
Marshalls is increasing output 
to meet growing demand and 
deliver benefits from operational 
gearing. The medium term objective 
is for the Group to return to the 
revenue and profit levels that were
achieved by Marshalls before 
the recession.

 Strategic Report
Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2016
31
Environment
The Board recognises the requirement
under Section 414C of the Companies 
Act 2006 to detail information about
environmental matters (including the
impact of the Company’s business on the
environment), employee, human rights,
social and community issues, including
information about any policies it has in
relation to these matters and effectiveness
of these policies. 
The Company seeks to ensure that its
business is conducted in a manner that 
is responsible to the environment and has
introduced an electronic communications
policy. This policy has led to a significant
increase in the number of such
communications, with a commensurate
reduction in the distribution of hard copy
documents. The management and
administration of the Company is
undertaken by the Investment Adviser.
YFM Private Equity Limited recognises the
importance of its environmental
responsibilities, monitors its impact on the
environment and implements policies to
reduce any damage that might be caused
by its activities. Initiatives of the
Investment Adviser designed to minimise
its and the Company’s impact on the
environment include recycling and
reducing energy consumption. Given the
size and nature of the Company’s activities
and the fact that it has no employees, the
Board considers there is limited scope to
develop and implement social and
community policies.
Anti-Bribery and
Corruption Policy
The Company has a zero tolerance
approach to bribery. The following is 
a summary of its policy:
• it is the Company’s policy to conduct
all of its business in an honest and
ethical manner. The Company is
committed to acting professionally,
fairly and with integrity in all its
business dealings and relationships;
• the directors of the Company, the
Investment Adviser and any other
service providers must not promise,
offer, give, request, agree to receive or
accept financial or other advantage in
return for favourable treatment, to
influence a business outcome or gain
any business advantage on behalf of
the Company or encourage others to
do so; and
• the Company has communicated its
anti-bribery policy to the Investment
Adviser and its other service
providers.
The Company had no employees during
the year. The Board is composed of three
male non-executive directors. For a review
of the policies used when appointing
directors to the Board of the Company
please refer to the Directors’
Remuneration Report.
The Strategic Report on pages 6 to 31 is

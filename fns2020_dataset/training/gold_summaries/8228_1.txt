 Chief Executive’s Review
Intelek recorded an encouraging
performance in what was a turbulent
year in terms of the global economy.
Underlying profit before tax increased by
23% on a sales increase of 9% on the
previous year. Our strategy of targeting
Government sectors, adopted across
all our three businesses after the last
downturn, has proved to be successful,
particularly so in the last twelve months.
n In satellite communications, Paradise
Datacom’s sales were 20% ahead
of last year, helped substantially
by the improved dollar exchange
rate and by Government/military
programmes that offset the global
softening of demand for commercial
telecoms. The prospects for satellite
communications remain exciting
with strong fundamental drivers:
progression towards HDTV,
increased use of the internet, a
strong demand from the defence
sector and the spread of mobile/
cellular telephony in developing
countries.
n In microwave components, Labtech
continued its strategic transformation
into a defence and air traffic control
components business, replacing
former telecommunications sales
with new orders from Government
equipment manufacturers, including
£2.3 million of orders for phased
array radar systems.
n In aerospace, CML won further
business on the world’s largest
military jet programme, the Joint
Strike Fighter, and benefited
from increased sales from our
core customer base where we
have a number of long-standing
relationships.
“An encouraging performance in a turbulent year.
The Group remains well positioned and we look to 
the future with confidence.”

Satellite
communications
Paradise Datacom 
John Restivo President
 Sales £18.3 million (2008: £15.3 million)
Operating Profit £3.6 million (2008: £3.2 million)
Paradise Datacom has a global
presence, headquartered in State
College, Pennsylvania and with
additional locations in Essex (UK),
Atlanta (Georgia), Phoenix (Arizona),
Beijing (China) and Bangkok
(Thailand), and representatives in
all other major territories. Paradise
Datacom manufactures a broad
range of products that are used in
satellite-based telecommunications
systems. Satellite communications
is a multi $billion industry. Paradise
Datacom serves the ground station
portion, supplying a market currently
estimated at $400 million.
Satellites provide a unique benefit
to telecommunications operators in
that they lack many of the obstacles
faced by terrestrial-based alternatives,
including point-to-point microwave
towers, pole-mounted copper
cables and optical fibre. With an
unobstructed view of the satellite,
a ground terminal can be installed
quickly and with relative ease allowing
links and networks the ability to “go
live” with minimal difficulty and delay.
In a point-to-multipoint scenario,
where a large area such as an entire
continent is the target recipient of a
voice, video or data service, satellite-
delivery as a broadcast medium
is virtually unchallenged. Satellites
are critical for mobile applications
such as satellite news gathering
(SNG) vehicles and military flyway
terminals. The global demand for
ever increasing volumes of data, for
example for high definition, internet
and remote monitoring and control,
drive investment in new technologies.
Paradise Datacom products cover
essential elements used in most
satellite ground stations and provide
new technological solutions with
continuous investment in research
and development.
The diverse Paradise Datacom
product portfolio is broken into
two basic categories and includes
both radio-frequency (RF) products
and satellite modems. Satellite
modems manufactured by Paradise
Datacom have been expanded into
three product lines consisting of
Evolution, Vision and the most recent
introduction, Quantum. Evolution
addresses conventional point-to-point
applications; Vision targets Digital
Television Broadcast operators;
Quantum, the Company’s most
sophisticated and versatile modem,
incorporates elements of both
Evolution and Vision as well as a host
of other unique features pioneered by
Paradise Datacom.
Since satellite lease charges can
represent up to 30% of a network
operator’s running costs, products
and technologies that provide
bandwidth savings are in great
demand. In mid 2009/10, Paradise
Datacom will begin shipping modems
with two new technologies, Sat-Abis,
an optimiser for cellular network
operators, and ViaSat’s patented
Paired Carrier Multiple Access
(PCMA) technology embedded.
PCMA allows satellite ground station
operators the potential to cut their
satellite lease costs in half, by
overlapping both the transmit and
the receive carriers to transmit data,
using echo cancellation.
Paradise Datacom’s RF product range
is one of the most extensive available
in the industry. It consists of solid
state power amplifiers (SSPAs) with
output power levels from 10 watts
to 8,000 watts, Block Upconverters
(BUCs) and low-noise amplifiers
(LNAs). Recent product innovations
include PowerMAX, vBUC, Gallium
Nitride-based SSPA module
architectures and an expanding range
of Ka-band amplifiers. These ensure
a continuation of Paradise Datacom’s
position at the forefront of technology
and developments in the satellite
amplifier market.

Sales/Head ($000)
Paradise Datacom produced another
record performance with profit up by
15%, helped by the strengthening of the
US$ where the average rate of $1.71/£
compared favourably with the prior
year average of $2.01/£. Sustained by
Government business in many countries
across the world, Paradise Datacom’s
dollar sales increased by 2% despite
the weakening commercial market.
With margins steady at 20% of sales,
2008/09 recorded an impressive financial
performance especially when taking
into account the additional investment
made in front-end sales resources and
increased engineering capability.
During the past year, as part of an
ongoing effort to increase market share
and expand brand recognition, Paradise
Datacom opened engineering and sales
offices in Thailand and China and a
service centre in India. This has resulted
in greater visibility of regional sales
opportunities and has given Paradise
Datacom access to large-scale operators
who require a local presence in order
to provide product repair, operational
training and post-sales support. As a
consequence, sales to the territories
covered by these offices increased by
£1.5 million in 2008/09.
In addition to the Asian expansion, an
engineering facility was established in
Phoenix, Arizona enabling Paradise
Datacom to capitalise on the abundance
of local engineers with skills relevant
to Paradise Datacom’s market focus.
These new facilities complement our
existing operations in State College,
Pennsylvania.
Paradise Datacom’s modem range has
been expanded and now consists of
Evolution, Vision and the most recent
introduction, Quantum. The Evolution
modem addresses conventional point-
to-point applications including open
network standards i.e. international
business services and backhaul links
such as those used in cellular networks.
The Vision modem targets Digital
Television Broadcast operators and
meets global digital video broadcasting
standards (DVB-S/DVB-S2). Quantum,
our most sophisticated and versatile
modem, incorporates elements of both
Evolution and Vision as well as a series
of integrated test and monitoring facilities
pioneered by Paradise Datacom, that are
accessible remotely via the internet.
Our facility in State College in the
USA has also broadened its range of
amplifiers to meet the ever changing
demands being placed on the satellite
communications industry by government
and commercial customers. The
introduction into operational service of
the first two Wideband Gapfiller satellites,
with the forecast of up to a dozen more,
has released what is certain to be a
significant rise in the demand for X and
Ka-band products by US and foreign
government agencies who already
account for more than 50% of Paradise
Datacom’s business.
Key Performance Indicators
Three key ratios for each of the operating companies 
have been selected to highlight performance movement 
in the last three years with brief explanatory comments 
where necessary.
(a) Sales per head reduced slightly following the next 
phase of investment in sales and engineering 
resources.
(b) The 2008 stock level was unusually low given the
demands of the industry for fast response.
Nevertheless, the 2009 level is higher than planned
and should be reduced during the first half of 2009/10.
(c) Strong margins continued the excellent record of 
return on capital employed.

Satellite
communications 
Paradise Datacom
Some of the major programmes won
by Paradise Datacom during the year
included:
n A multi-year retrofit programme for
government transportable earth
stations using C, Ku and X-band
SSPAs was perhaps the most
significant award. Approximately
$2.2 million has been shipped to date
with significant follow-on anticipated
during the course of the current
calendar year.
n A $2 million order was received at the
end of the financial year from a major
US systems integrator for the initial
phase of a large NATO programme.
n Europe’s Galileo and China’s
Compass global positioning satellite
networks placed orders for ground
control amplifiers for their satellite
constellations totalling approximately
$1 million.
n A major satellite system operator
in Asia purchased $1.5 million in
high-power solid state amplifiers to
replace ageing tube amplifiers, with
another $0.5 million pending.
n An IP network operator in Western
Canada has also begun placing
orders for Paradise Datacom SSPAs
to replace existing products, with
total orders expected to surpass
$1 million in 2009.
n In addition, two of our recently
released products, the Quantum
modem and the vBUC amplifier, are
currently undergoing evaluation for
a significant upgrade to an existing
network in Alaska.
Paradise Datacom has one of the most
extensive product offerings of any SSPA
(solid state power amplifier) and Modem
manufacturer in the industry. Recently
released product innovations should
ensure a continued increase in RF market
share. These include PowerMAX, the
highest power, most versatile SSPA on
the market, vBUC (Block Up Converters)
and the incorporation of the latest high-
power components (Gallium Nitride)
into a new range of SSPA modules. In
addition, Paradise Datacom will soon
be launching an expanded range of Low
Noise Amplifiers (LNAs) and Ka-band
SSPA product lines. On the satellite
modem side, attention will be focused
on products that optimise bandwidth,
giving customers significant cost
savings. Sat-Abis, for cellular backhaul
applications, has been released recently,
and Paired Carrier Multiple Access
(PCMA) is expected to be launched mid-
year 2009/10, under licence from ViaSat.
Paradise Datacom will continue to
update its product portfolio to meet the
needs of the customer base it serves.

Microwave components
and manufacturing 
services
Labtech Microwave
Brian Mazonas Managing Director
 Sales £7.3 million (2008: £7.9 million)
Operating Profit £ Breakeven (2008: £0.2 million)
Labtech Microwave specialises in the
manufacture of advanced microwave
electronic printed circuit boards and
the design, manufacture, assembly and
test of MMIC (monolithic microwave
integrated circuits) packages and
microwave components. Microwave
circuits and components are
manufactured in prototype and
medium to high volumes for major
defence, telecommunication, ATC
(air traffic control) and space system
customers worldwide.
Labtech Microwave’s extensively
equipped printed circuit boards
processing plant is based in a purpose-
built facility in Presteigne, Wales and its
component design and build facility is in
Milton Keynes.
Labtech Microwave’s printed circuit
board technology is focused on the
processing of high performance
PTFE (Teflon) microwave substrates
with plated through holes and high
specification wire bondable plating
finishes. Circuit layers can be bonded
together in a multilayer construction
and include precision machined metal
backing for high frequency applications
such as broadband digital radio links,
microwave power amplifiers and
phased array radar antennas. The
printed circuit board technology covers
applications from low microwave
frequencies (~1GHz) to millimetre-
wave frequencies (up to 94GHz) where
circuit feature tolerances require the
most advanced processing techniques
including laser profiling.
Labtech Microwave exploits its 20
years experience in design and
manufacture of a range of high-end
broadband microwave components
mainly for the European defence
market. Using high accuracy thin
film ceramic circuit manufacturing
capability, Labtech Microwave
produces multioctave microwave
amplifiers, switches and detector log
video amplifiers (DLVAs). In the last
3 years or so Labtech Microwave,
utilising the latest microwave circuit
technology at Presteigne, has
embarked on a plan to develop
a broad range of components to
address key market sectors. Products
including DLVAs, amplifiers and
switches have been established
and are being routinely sold into
the defence markets. Development
work started during the year to
produce a Ka-Band LNA for the
SatCom market which is being
marketed by Paradise Datacom.
The combination of precision
circuit machining (including laser
technology), advanced automatic
chemical processing and component
design, assembly and test gives
Labtech Microwave a leading world-
class capability. By integrating these
capabilities Labtech Microwave is able
to address successfully the emerging
markets of MMIC packaging and
phased array radar where the ability to
manufacture and test these advanced
microwave circuits is key.

Microwave components
and manufacturing 
services 
Labtech Microwave
During the year, Labtech Microwave
continued its transformation into a
defence and air traffic control (ATC)
components business with both these
key market segments showing significant
growth. As anticipated, sales into the
telecom radio link market reduced
by nearly 25% year on year which
resulted in overall sales reducing by
£0.6 million. The second half of the
year was progressively affected by
the worsening economic conditions,
particularly in the commercial telecoms
market. In addition, the order placement
of a large defence contract and the start
of a substantial ATC project were delayed
to the end of the year which resulted
in a break-even on trading profit
(2008: £0.15 million). The 12 month
book to bill has been maintained
at 1.06:1.
Further important contract wins in the
European AESA/Phased Array radar
market amounted to £2.3 million, of
which £1.2 million was shipped during
the year. These radars are becoming
the preferred option for military use
as they offer significant weight and
cost advantages when compared with
mechanically steered radars and provide
the very high performance capability
needed for today’s military operations.
Management estimate that the total
annual market is $2 billion and it is
forecast to grow at 20% per annum.
Labtech Microwave’s addressable
portion of this market is estimated
at £80 million. Our multilayer printed
circuit boards are manufactured at the
Presteigne site and then assembled and
tested at the Milton Keynes location.
This integrated capability has proved
to have significant market appeal with
Labtech Microwave now involved in
many key phased array programmes
throughout Europe.
Labtech Microwave has also enhanced
its position in other areas of the defence
market via its ranges of amplifiers,
specialist microwave switches and
Sales/Head (£000)
Key Performance Indicators
(a) Sales per head were affected by the continued 
reduction in volume telecommunications business.
(b) Labtech carries a relatively low level of stock, 
though this has increased as a consequence of the 
increase in defence and component sales.

crystal polymer substrates, are now 
routinely used especially for millimetre 
wave applications (e.g. 60 and 94GHz) 
for very high capacity radio links and 
highly sensitive detectors in the security 
and industrial markets.
The business also continues to pursue 
opportunities in other microwave 
markets as it moves away from the 
commodity driven telecom business. 
During the last year, Labtech Microwave 
has substantially increased its sales of 
specialist microwave circuits into the air 
traffic control market - for both defence 
and commercial applications. Towards 
the end of the financial year, Labtech 
was awarded a contract which will lead 
to significant business growth in this 
market sector. Orders to date under 
this contract have already exceeded 
£1 million. As part of this new contract, 
Labtech Microwave has installed and 
commissioned an autoclave at its 
Presteigne facility which will enable it to 
produce multilayer antenna elements up 
to 6 feet long.
The growing high frequency Ka-Band 
SatCom market already utilises Labtech 
Microwave’s high precision circuit 
board processing capability. These 
skills, together with the design and 
manufacturing expertise of the Milton 
Keynes site, are being employed to 
develop a Ka-Band Low Noise Amplifier 
(LNA) for the SatCom market. This 
amplifier is being sold and promoted by 
Paradise Datacom in the USA.
Looking ahead, Labtech Microwave 
will continue to grow its defence and 
air traffic control business (already 
more than 50% of sales) offset in part 
by further reductions in the telecom 
business levels leaving a modest growth 
in total sales year on year. In line with 
the changing business needs, cost 
reductions were implemented at the end 
of the year and, together with a higher 
margin product mix, it is expected that 
profitability will improve as the 2009/10 
year progresses. 
Ka-band Low Noise Amplifier, designed by Labtech Microwave for Paradise Datacom
Detector Log Video Amplifiers (DLVAs). 
Currently, Labtech Microwave is 
developing new DLVAs which operate 
at higher frequencies and have faster 
response times. DLVAs are used as part 
of an electronic surveillance system 
to detect incoming threats, requiring 
nano-second response times to trigger 
defensive solutions.
The anticipated decline in Labtech 
Microwave’s telecommunication sales 
continued during the year, although 
a focus on the higher-end radio link 
market helped stabilise the decline. Sales 
reduced 25% in 2008/09 as a leading 
European OEM completed its strategy 
of sourcing from the Far East. However, 
Labtech Microwave’s capabilities 
remain in demand for the very high-end 
products and from the smaller radio link 
suppliers who value Labtech’s more 
complete service offering including 
MMIC (Monolithic Microwave Integrated 
Circuit) packaging and assembly of the 
microwave transceivers. These high 
performance packages, utilising liquid

CML 
Geoff Stewart Managing Director
 Sales £13.9 million (2008: £12.9 million)
Operating Profit £2.0 million (2008: £1.8 million)
CML Group manufactures machined, 
composite and sheet metal 
components and assemblies for 
aerostructures and aircraft systems 
and its customers include Airbus UK, 
APPH, BAe Systems, GE Aviation, 
GKN Aerospace, Hawker Beechcraft, 
Mecachrome, Senior Aerospace, and 
Westland Helicopters.
The Group has four divisions located 
on two sites in Birkenhead in the 
North West of England with a third 
site being planned to re-locate and 
expand the Group’s composite 
capability.
The Precision Machining Division is 
focused on 4 and 5-axis machining of 
aluminium and hard metals. Principal 
products, covering almost the full 
range of Airbus commercial and 
military aircraft, include interspar ribs 
and ancillary components, landing 
gear rib supports, sidestay fittings 
and links, underwing access panels, 
engine thrust fittings and aft mounting 
brackets etc. Components for military 
and rotary wing aircraft are also 
supplied to other customers.
The Composites Division specialises 
in the manufacture and repair of 
glass and carbon fibre components 
and assemblies. Products include 
various wing and fuselage fairings, 
covers, and panels, nose and tail 
cone assemblies, air-conditioning 
ducts, flooring etc. The division has a 
significant presence on a number of 
new-build programmes, particularly 
the F-35 Lightning II (Joint Strike 
Fighter), the Hawker 987 business 
jet and the Future Lynx helicopter 
whilst spares and other new build 
requirements are supplied for a 
variety of civil, business and military 
aircraft programmes.
The Fabrication Division’s two 
main revenue streams are from the 
manufacture of extruded fuselage 
and wing stringers for the Hawker 
987 build programme and from its 
position as a key supplier of sheet 
metal spare parts for Airbus’ in-
service fleet. 
The Treatments Division provides 
a comprehensive in-house surface 
treatments capability not only to the 
other three Divisions but also to a 
valuable external customer base.

CML performed at record levels in 
2008/09 with an improvement in 
operating profit of 15% over the previous 
year on an increase in sales of 8%. As a 
result of the continued drive to improve 
performance and reduce waste, CML 
has increased its return on sales to 
15% (2008: 14%) delivering an excellent 
return on capital employed of 47% 
(2008: 43%).
During the last quarter of the financial 
year, we have seen a slow-down in 
order intake as a result of the global 
recession and, in particular, the business 
jet sector for which CML is a supplier 
through the Hawker Beechcraft 987 
programme. Throughout the year the 
precision machining division has seen 
levels of business for large commercial 
aircraft holding steady with forecasts 
going forward from Airbus showing build 
rates continuing at a similar level for the 
coming year. Sales for the Composites 
division were 22% up on the previous 
financial year on the back of strong 
demand from key customers Airbus, 
Hawker Beechcraft and BAe Systems. 
This included some £0.7 million of 
orders from BAe Systems on the F35 
Joint Strike Fighter programme. The 
fabrications division’s sales increased by 
30% on the previous year with the higher 
margin spares business growing by 73% 
to £0.8 million. The treatments division’s 
external sales were 10% down on the 
previous financial year as a consequence 
of the emphasis placed on supporting 
CML’s internal requirements.

Health, Safety and the 
Environment
Build rates have reduced sharply for 
corporate jets and flattened off for 
commercial jets. However, the long-
term drivers for growth are expected to 
support recovery in the years ahead. 
CML will manage its cost base in the 
face of a short-term drop in demand, 
whilst developing the spares business 
and continuing to implement our strategy 
to expand the composites division to 
support the market evolution towards the 
use of lightweight composite structures. 
During 2009 a new 60,000 square foot 
composites facility is set to be opened, 
supported by grant funding through the 
North West Development Agency.
This new facility will elevate CML’s 
position in the industry, providing 
additional capacity and capability to 
support the increase in build rates on 
packages we currently manufacture for 
the Joint Strike Fighter programme and 
to develop further opportunities on UAVs 
(Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) for which we 
took our first orders from BAe Systems 
this year. This, combined with the 
increased use of composites for the next 
generation of commercial and business 
aircraft, will put CML in a strong position 
within an aerospace industry that shows 
significant opportunities for growth in 
the long term.
The new 60,000 sq ft Composites facility, due to open towards the end of 2009
Intelek continues to invest in the training 
and development of staff at all levels and 
remains committed to the highest levels 
of husbandry of the local environment 
and care of employees. Our aim is to 
minimise waste, use valuable resources 
efficiently and prevent damage to the 
environment. Both our manufacturing 
companies which employ the use of 
chemical processes are approved to the 
international environmental standard 
ISO 14001. In addition, these two 
operating companies have been 
surveyed by the Carbon Trust and 
are implementing their energy-saving 
recommendations.

Outlook
The PowerMax, the world’s highest power solid state amplifier 
At the time of writing this report, we are 
two months into our new financial year 
and continue to experience considerable 
uncertainty in our commercial market-
place although Government-funded 
programmes, which are particularly 
important to Paradise Datacom and 
Labtech Microwave, remain resilient. 
Timing of contract wins, however, can 
be somewhat difficult to predict. Our 
aerospace division, CML, will be affected 
by the well-documented issues in the 
corporate jet market. 
Our strategy of targeting Government 
sectors continues to reap rewards and 
major defence opportunities across 
the Group are increasing. We have 
implemented cost reductions throughout 
the Group in anticipation of reduced 
commercial demand, whilst preserving 
our ability to reinstate capacity once we 
signs of recovery. Based on our first two 
months of trading, we expect our first 
half to be lower than last year. However 
the release of Paradise Datacom’s new 
modem and amplifier products, together 
with the level of enquiries being fielded 
on Government programme, indicate 
that we should see an improved second 
half to the year. The Group remains well 
positioned in its key areas of satellite 
communications and we look forward to 
the future with confidence.

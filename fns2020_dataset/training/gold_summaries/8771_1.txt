STRATEGIC REPORT
29
This has been a year of great progress for the Group from a financial, 
strategic and operational perspective. 
In what has been a challenging year for the industry, Jimmy Choo 
has  performed strongly in 2014, with double digit revenue growth at 
constant currency driven by a mix of like for like growth from strong 
product authority and retail excellence, new store openings with 
a focus on China and continued growth in partnership with our 
wholesale customers. Revenue grew by 12.2% on a constant 
currency basis (6.4% on a reported currency basis) to £299.7m in 
2014, driven by strong performance in both ladies’ and men’s shoes. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin grew to 16.8% despite significant currency 
headwinds, demonstrating the operating leverage of the business.
PRODUC TS
Our focus on shoes and dedication to product quality has ensured we 
continued to produce innovative products which resonate strongly 
with our clients around the world. 
As a luxury accessories brand, design and quality is everything. The 
brand positioning is nurtured and the DNA is expressed through the 
products we design and produce. 2014 was a strong year for us from 
a design perspective. The resonance of our collections with our 
clients is apparent in achieving revenue growth ahead of the market. 
We also received external validation of this at Paris Fashion Week in 
2014, where Sandra Choi and Jimmy Choo won Marie Claire’s Prix 
d’Excellence de la Mode Award for best shoe collection. 
Shoes continue to be at the heart of the brand, representing three 
quarters of the business. In accessories, evening bags and small 
leather goods (“SLG”) continued to perform well.
CHOO 24:7
The iconic Choo 24:7 collection which forms the Jimmy Choo 
woman’s perfect wardrobe of shoes underpins our business, forming 
roughly half of our shoe sales. The balance between our continuative 
and seasonal collections is one of the key elements of our 
merchandising strategy. We introduced new colours and fabrics in 
our iconic shoe styles in line with the seasonal collections. This 
maintains the cohesion of our seasonal look and feel and introduces 
newness into the continuative collection. 
CHOO.0 8°
In 2014, we launched a new collection called CHOO.08°, creating 
a cohesive collection based around boots and sneakers with a cool 
London feel. While many of the product elements of CHOO.08° 
were already in our Fashion and Weekend collections, bringing them 
together into a single collection allows us to present the biker cool 
and daring side of the brand DNA in a cohesive way, with tailored 
advertising and events. The response to CHOO.08° has been very 
positive, especially with our Asian and European clients. 
MADE TO ORDER
In order to enhance the luxury positioning of the brand and create a 
more bespoke offering for our clients, we launched Made To Order 
shoes in 2014. Clients can have a pair of shoes made, choosing from 
a range of designs and heel heights, fabric colour or skin and 
personalise them with their initials on the sole.
Made to Order was originally offered in selected stores from early 
in the year. Subsequently, the enhanced online platform has allowed 
us to roll the Made to Order service out across the retail website, 
providing a much wider footprint.

VICES
In addition to our usual seasonal collections, Creative Director 
Sandra Choi produced an exciting limited edition capsule collection 
with contemporary artist Mat Collishaw. The collection united 
Sandra Choi’s personal fascination with jewels with an exploration 
of themes of envy, seduction and the irrepressible yearning for 
objects of beauty. 
MEN
Men’s continued to be our strongest growth category, representing 
5% of revenue. We launched the first ever shoe fashion show in 
2014, building upon the remarkable growth of the men’s luxury shoe 
market and showcasing our fashion forward credentials in the space. 
The event was a great success, with Kit Harrington, Tinie Tempah 
and Jack Guinness amongst the guests.
In addition, we launched Jimmy Choo Man, our first male fragrance, 
with our partners InterParfums SA. The fragrance has performed 
well above our expectations, further demonstrating the appeal of 
the brand image in the rapidly expanding men’s luxury space.  JIMMY CHOO PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2014

DISTRIBUTION
We launched a new store concept, developed with David Collins 
Studio and inspired by haute couture salons and fantasy shoe closets. 
This refreshes the look and feel of our stores, emphasises the luxury 
positioning of the brand and presents the fashion driven products in 
more space, while retaining the higher product densities in the key 
Choo 24:7 collection. Client response has been very positive.
NEW STORE CONCEPT
NEW BOND STREET
We continued to drive our retail channel expansion, with a net nine 
new DOS opened in the period. The focus of our retail expansion 
remains in Asia, where we are under-represented relative to our 
luxury peers.
RENOVATIONS AND 
RELOCATIONS

In addition, we began to renovate our existing store portfolio in the 
new store concept. We began with our Beverly Hills flagship, which 
reopened in early 2014 and completed 14 stores in the new concept 
by the end of the year. While it is still early days, we are greatly 
encouraged by the results to date, with the newly renovated stores 
consistently outperforming the rest of the portfolio. 
The reopening of our New Bond Street global flagship was a highlight 
of the year. Now covering three floors, the New Bond Street 
Townhouse gives us the space to present the fullest expression 
of the Jimmy Choo brand.
We intend to continue the renovation programme, with 10 to 15 
renovations per annum in addition to the new store openings, all 
of which will be in the new store concept.
ASIAN GROWTH OPPORTUNITY
Our growth potential in Asia was one of the opportunities which 
initially attracted me to Jimmy Choo. The luxury market in China has 
been driven by a relatively small number of global brands with broad 
product offerings. Women’s luxury shoes was not a large player in 
this initial wave of luxury consumption, focusing more on gifting 
items purchased by largely male clients. What we have seen in the 
last few years is a shift towards non-logo brands purchased by 
affluent women for their own consumption.
In order to capitalise upon this opportunity, we have focused our 
Chinese growth strategy by buying out our franchise partner in 2012, 
opening Jimmy Choo offices in Hong Kong and Shanghai in order 
to manage the operations in the region effectively and introducing 
focused brand communication messages tailored for the 
Chinese market.
As with “Sex in the City” in the nineties and the “Devil Wears Prada” 
in the following decade, Jimmy Choo’s style and product authority 
continues to catch the fashion zeitgeist. Our products were featured 
in a 2013 storyline of “My Love From the Star”, a popular television 
series in Korea. Korean media has an incredible influence on the 
Asian region as a whole and China in particular, and this alongside 
the focused brand communication in the region has transformed our 
Chinese brand awareness. The shoe featured in the story line has 
been a global best seller and continues to outstrip our expectations. 
The focused strategy in the region has been successful, with very 
strong growth rates in our stores on the ground in China and 
travelling Chinese becoming our second largest travelling client 
group, behind Russians.

There is a much larger growth opportunity for Jimmy Choo in China 
and the wider Asian region, where we remain underpenetrated 
relative to much of the wider luxury market. This includes Japan, 
which remains one of our fastest growing regions. We plan to 
continue to open the majority of our new stores each year in China. 
We have changed franchise partners in Korea, and intend to begin 
the process of forming a JV there in the coming year. This, alongside 
further JVs in Singapore and Malaysia, will allow us to focus and drive 
our growth in the region as we have done in Japan and China.
INVESTMENT IN SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES
During the year we consolidated jimmychoo.com on our new 
platform, increasing our flexibility and ability to leverage our online 
sales platform as we move towards an omnichannel model. 
The improvements made to the online platform and our digital 
communication resulted in L2Digital rating Jimmy Choo as “Gifted” 
in 2014, which underlines the preparations we are making for the 
future development of omnichannel. We also continued to implement 
SAP in our regional operations and began the roll out of elements of 
Product Lifecycle Management (“PLM”), to bring together everything 
from initial sketches and materials research through to prototyping, 
orders, production and reorders into a single system.
2015 will continue this transformation programme, with the near 
final stage of the SAP roll-out and moving into the central global 
distribution centre in Switzerland. This will represent a key stage 
in the development of our omnichannel capability. We plan to be 
initiating trials of the first stages of omnichannel delivery in 2016. 
I would like to take the opportunity to thank all of our stakeholders for 
their contribution to this year’s strong results. I would especially like 
to thank our employees across the business for their hard work in this 
transformational year.

Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report and Accounts 
for the year ended 30 September 2016
Strategic report
Chairman’s  
statement
Introduction
I am pleased to present our Annual 
Report and Accounts for the year 
ended 30 September 2016, a year in 
which we have made strong progress 
in building a more valuable Enterprise 
Inns. The business is performing well 
with continued growth momentum 
and strategic evolution on track, 
providing a clear path to maximising 
shareholder value through the 
optimisation of returns from every 
one of our 4,920 properties.
Market and strategy
The market in which the Group 
operates is routinely subject to 
regulatory and legislative scrutiny and 
during the year the Government’s 
response to the Pubs Code and Pubs 
Code Adjudicator consultation was 
published, resulting in a new statutory 
code which became effective on 
21 July 2016. We are pleased that 
the uncertainty created during the 
wait for its implementation has now 
ended and believe that our strategic 
plans represent the most appropriate 
response to this change in regulatory 
environment.
We are evolving from a predominantly 
leased and tenanted operation to a 
portfolio of businesses which operate 
a variety of models and trading styles, 
providing the flexibility to optimise the 
returns from every asset. These take 
the form of publican partnerships, 
commercial properties, managed 
operations and managed investments. 
We are on track with our conversions 
to these various operating models. 
We have 273 properties trading as 
commercial properties and more 
than 100 pubs within our managed 
business. 
Performance  
and dividends
The Group delivered EBITDA before 
exceptional items of £292 million, 
resulting in a profit before tax and 
exceptional items for the 2016 year of 
£122 million and an adjusted earnings 
per share (EPS) of 19.6p, 0.2p up on 
the previous year.
Publican Partnerships (our leased and 
tenanted estate) continues to achieve 
positive like-for-like net income growth 
for each quarter and an increase of 
2.1% for the full year. We have now 
achieved 13 successive quarters 
of like-for-like growth. Commercial 
Properties like-for-like net income 
has increased by 3.8%. These strong 
results have generated free cash flow, 
which has been used to reinvest in 
the business to drive future growth 
and reduced leverage. In addition, and 
while the Board continues to believe 
that the resumption of dividend 
payments is not appropriate, we 
took the opportunity to create value 
by returning funds to shareholders, 
through the share buyback 
programme launched in March 2016. 
The Board has committed to return 
£25 million to shareholders, and at the 
date of this report £13 million has so 
far been returned from the 14 million 
shares bought back.
People
I would like to acknowledge  
and say thank you on behalf of 
the Board for the hard work and 
dedication that our colleagues 
and publicans have demonstrated 
throughout the year. It has been a 
year of incredible change, as our new 
strategy has significant ramifications 
across the Group. Our colleagues 
have responded with renewed energy 
and commitment. The fact that 
Enterprise can deliver such strong 
results throughout this period is a real 
testament to our people.
Outlook
Whilst the legislation is now certain, 
its impact on our business is not yet 
clear; however, with the work done 
over the last few years, the Group 
is in the best position to be able 
to respond to the challenges and 
opportunities, as they arise. Although 
mindful of the potential consequences 
of Brexit, we have seen no discernible 
impact to date on consumer spending 
and no consequential impact on our 
trading performance.

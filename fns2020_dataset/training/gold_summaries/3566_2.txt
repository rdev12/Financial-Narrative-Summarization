“We have made significant progress during the last
12 months, our fourth successive year of profit and overall
growth. Revenues from existing customers represent 92% of
the Group’s total revenue, which is a strong endorsement of
the product quality and service excellence that we offer. ” 
John O’Connell, Non-Executive Chairman
“During the year there has been a
series of strategic developments
including the Baron acquisition and
the replacement of the Ticketing
system. We are particularly excited by
the Sodexho opportunity, which will
accelerate our entry into new market
sectors. The increase in recurring
revenues also provides the Group with
increased forward visibility.
Furthermore, acquisitions completed
over the last few years continue to be
integrated, and are yielding significant
benefits across the Group. ”

Chairman’s Statement
*Underlying profit and underlying earnings per share, which
are defined on page 60, are used to report our financial
performance in 2005 on a comparable basis to that of 2004.
I am pleased to report that in 2005 Carillion achieved all its key
financial targets and made substantial strategic progress to deliver
further profitable growth, both organically and through the
acquisition of mechanical and electrical engineering maintenance
company, PME. 
In December 2005, we announced the terms of a recommended
cash and shares offer for the acquisition of Mowlem plc. This
acquisition, which received the overwhelming support of Carillion
and Mowlem shareholders, was completed in February 2006 and, 
in line with our strategy, represents a step change in Carillion’s
transformation. 
In this report, Carillion has presented for the first time its full-year
financial results under International Financial Reporting Standards. In
2005, revenue increased by 15 per cent to £2,284 million, including
joint ventures, (2004: £1,985 million), despite the impact of
transferring to Network Rail maintenance contracts that generated
£150 million of revenue in 2004. Underlying* profit before tax also
increased by 15 per cent to £55.5 million (2004: £48.1 million).
Operating cash flow remained strong and at 31 December 2005 
net cash amounted to £90.8 million (2004: £128.8 million).
The intake of new orders in 2005 was particularly strong and by 
the year end the value of the Group’s order book and framework
contracts had increased by 40 per cent to £7 billion (2004: £5 billion).
The integration of PME, which we acquired in March 2005, has
been completed successfully. This has significantly strengthened our
building management and support services capability and enhanced
our earnings in 2005.
Three non-executive directors, Sir Neville Simms, our previous
chairman, Andrew Parrish and Roger Dickens, retired from the Board
in 2005. I should like to record the Board’s thanks and recognition
for their contributions to the development and success of Carillion
and in particular to record the Board’s deep sadness at the death 
of Roger Dickens early in 2006. During 2005, we were pleased 
to welcome to the Board two new non-executive directors. The
appointment of Vanda Murray OBE in June, which I reported to
shareholders in my Interim Report, was followed by the appointment
in November of David Maloney, who brings to the Board
considerable experience in a number of service industry sectors. 
With a record order book and strong presence in our key 
growth markets, the outlook was already positive for Carillion to
deliver sustainable growth. However, the acquisition of Mowlem 
will accelerate growth substantially and create significant value 
for shareholders. It brings together two companies of a similar 
size with an excellent strategic fit, complementary skills and 
market strengths, to create one of the largest support services 
and construction companies in the UK and with substantial
international businesses. Combining the two companies will
generate opportunities for cost savings and strengthen Carillion’s
ability to compete successfully in its chosen markets. As a result, we
expect the acquisition of Mowlem to enhance earnings materially in
2007, the first full year of operation following the acquisition. 
The strong platform that has enabled us to acquire Mowlem and
move forward into 2006 with considerable confidence is due to 
the leadership of Carillion’s senior management team and the
commitment and professionalism of all its people. On behalf of 
the Board I should like to offer our thanks to everyone in Carillion
for the contributions they have made to our success. 
In view of the financial performance in 2005 and enhanced
prospects for future growth, the Board is recommending a final
ordinary dividend for 2005 of 5.2 pence per share, making the total
full year dividend 8 pence per share, an increase of some 7 per cent
on the total dividend paid in respect of 2004 (7.5 pence per share).
The final ordinary dividend for 2005 will be paid on 23 June 2006 
to shareholders on the register at close of business on 28 April 2006.

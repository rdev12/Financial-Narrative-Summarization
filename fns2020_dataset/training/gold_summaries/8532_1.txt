 Financial performance
Turnover for the year of £58.9m (2002: £52.4m) and Gross Profits of £26.7m (2002: £21.4m) reflect both the
strength of the markets in which we operate and the benefits of re-focusing our business on its most profitable areas.
Control of overheads assisted Operating Profits of £11.7m (2002: £6.9m excluding impairment charges) and an
increase in Headline Profit before Tax to £15.5m from £8.4m last year. This is the stronger year in our biennial 
trading pattern and £2.4m of the increase in profits is attributable to events that only take place every two years.
Revenues are 12% higher than last year, despite the effect of a weakening dollar on our revenue streams. Circa
£4.4m of the increase in revenue is attributable to our biennial events, Moscow International Oil and Gas
and Autosalon.  Events which took place last year and did not recur in 2003 (or were discontinued)
and other timing differences reduced turnover by £4.3m. New launches and growth in our 
existing portfolio lifted turnover by £6.4m and profits by £3.6m.
The gross margin achieved of 45% is an improvement on last year’s margin of 41%. The
improvement is partly attributable to the margins we earn on the two biennial events,
and partly to the steps we have taken to reduce our cost of sales and to eliminate less
profitable business.
We carried out a review of our operating structure over the summer and the 
resulting changes yielded annualised savings of over £1m.  The costs of the
restructuring exercise were £0.4m. The cost of severing our relationship with the
Czech and Slovakian exhibition businesses was £0.8m. This included expensing
£0.5m of prepayments in respect of unused tenancies and a loss on disposal of
£0.2m. 
Our associated company contribution in the year primarily relates to our 50%
owned business in Istanbul, Turkey. The core business sold 150,000 square
metres, but yields are low and profits are depressed by the Turkish Lira, which
is only one third of its February 2001 value against the dollar.

ITE Group Plc
Annual Report 2003 The Group has performed well this year and the results represent a highly creditable performance.
This set of results confirms that our period of rationalisation and consolidation has been 
successfully completed and that the Group is making substantial progress. We have contracted
£35m of business for the 2004 year which is an increase on a like for like basis of 11%. 
Trading highlights
In 2003 we organised 114 events in 16 countries (2002: 117 events in 19 countries) and sold a
total of 292,000 square metres of space (2002: 255,800 square metres). We launched 19 new
events over the course of the year across a range of industries concentrating on the markets of
Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Turkey.
Like for like growth in space sales of our annually recurring events was in excess of 14%, led by
exceptionally strong results in our key core events. The top ten events ordered by contribution
to gross profit in 2003 and their change in size over the previous year were:
* 2002 Events not comparable due to biennial pattern
We enjoyed considerable growth in our key market, Moscow, which accounts for up to 70% of our
gross profit. The main influences were the good performance of our two biennial events and the
opening of a new 7,000 net square metre pavilion at the principal exhibition venue, Expocentr.

Expocentr  Russia
Offices : Moscow, St Petersburg. 
Our Russian exhibition business is very well established and enjoyed growth of 25% in both space and revenues.
Russia Building Week expanded to fill the newly built exhibition hall at Expocentr and has further potential to grow,
but is constrained for the time being by the availability of good quality exhibition space in Moscow.  Moscow
International Travel and Tourism show and the World Food Moscow event both enjoyed growth in space sales of
more than 15%. Our Oil and Gas event and Autosalon only take place every two years, but nevertheless both
enjoyed growth of 20% + over their previous editions. Moscow has become an increasingly competitive 
environment in recent years and presently continues to be under-resourced in available exhibition space. However,
new space will be available soon to provide the opportunity to enhance ITE’s growth.
The recently signed co-operation agreement with Expocentr is of real significance to the Group, as it secures our
key Moscow events at the leading Moscow venue of Expocentr for the foreseeable future.
Currently ITE is in new discussions to again further extend the term of our co-operation with Lenexpo, our 
principal venue in St Petersburg, following on from an agreement made late last year. Our premier events in 
St Petersburg remain the Baltic Building Week (8,000 Sq.m.) and Interfood St Petersburg (4,000 Sq.m.). We have
recently developed a new theme in St Petersburg with the agreement of a joint venture in the food production
technology area.

Food exhibition Central Asia
Offices: Kazakhstan (Almaty, Astana, Atyrau), Azerbaijan (Baku) and Uzbekistan
(Tashkent). 
ITE is the leading international operator established in these regions. The economies in these markets are 
buoyant, with growth underpinned by strong world oil and gas prices. In 2003 ITE launched 6 new events in the
region, mainly in Kazakhstan. The launches were in a range of industries including Building, Fashion, Packaging,
Cleaning and Chemicals.
In Kazakhstan, strong growth was developed in the city of Atyrau, where last year’s Infrastructure launch was split
into three separate exhibitions, all of which filled the existing venue capacity. In Almaty we entered into a 
funding arrangement to assist our venue partner to build a new exhibition hall, so as to facilitate growth in our
construction and oil and gas events (which both grew by circa 30%).
Our events in Azerbaijan are showing strong growth from a modest base – in particular in the medical and 
construction sectors.

Lighting prepared for exhibition Eastern & Southern Europe
Offices: Turkey (Istanbul), Ukraine (Kyiv).
We have strengthened our teams in Ukraine and Turkey and have increased the number of events held by making
a series of new launches. The reduction in space sales reflects the sale of our stand alone Czech business last
year and the decision to withdraw from our Belgrade events.
In Kyiv space sales increased by over 30%, though the new launch activity meant that this did not feed through
proportionately to profits. 
In Turkey our wholly owned business further extended its ‘Caspian’ brand, with successful launches in the
Transport, Banking and Finance and Ecology sectors. Caspian Telecoms, launched last year exhibited further good
growth. Overall space sales in Istanbul were affected by a reduction in size of the low yielding construction event,
Ankomak, but profits were still higher than in 2002.

Fashion exhibition Western Europe and UK
One of our strongest performing brands for the year was MODA UK fashion, which takes place in Spring and
Autumn at the NEC in Birmingham. In particular Womanswear outperformed all expectations and almost doubled
the prior year contribution. In September, ITE acquired a further 15% in ITE Moda Limited bringing our interest up
to 90%.

Building and interiors exhibition International Sales Offices & Rest of World
We have international sales offices based in London and Hamburg which focus on selling international exhibitors
into our emerging market events (sales are shown in the regions where the events are held). We recently reviewed
the structure of our London office with a view to reducing overheads. Together with other cost control measures
we have successfully reduced our cost base in London by circa £1m on an annualised basis, without impacting
our sales capacity.
The Group has an increased focus in Africa, although this is not yet significant in revenue terms.  Our industry
brands are proving to be very strong – particularly in Oil and Gas where our brand has helped us win the tender
for the 2005 World Petroleum Congress in Johannesburg. This in turn has provided a platform for ITE to increase
the spread of our oil and gas events throughout the African market. If we consider a market to have significant
potential, we look to follow with the introduction of other selected events from our portfolio of sector brands.

Contemporary stand design Associates
During the year ITE held 50% interests in exhibition organising businesses in the Czech Republic, in Turkey and in
Egypt. As noted earlier, subsequent to 30 September we have disposed of our Czech Republic interests.
ITF in Istanbul has had an encouraging year, organising 16 events including the re-launch of important Auto events
which had been postponed following the economic crisis in 2001. This business is however still the lowest 
yielding market in which we operate. Although the increase in space sales was of real significance, the challenge
for the future is to improve the yields and profitability of the key events.
Outlook
ITE has made very significant steps in consolidating and securing its key business interests throughout the course
of the past year. We have considerable assets in our brands, international sales networks and local office 
infrastructures and these will underpin future growth. The markets in which we specialise continue to offer 
excellent prospects for us to develop and grow our business further.  We are also pursuing new market 
opportunities to leverage our brand strengths.  I look forward to and am excited by the prospects ahead.

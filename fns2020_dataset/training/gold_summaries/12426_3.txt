 Chairman’s statement
“There is plenty of opportunity across 
Porvair for market share gains and the 
Board’s outlook is positive.”
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to report that Porvair continues
to make progress against its financial and
strategic objectives.
Results
Revenues in the year to 30 November 2012
were £76.5 million (2011: £68.1 million) and
profit before tax rose by 40% to £6.3 million
(2011: £4.5 million). These are record results
for the Group. Basic earnings per share were
10.1 pence (2011: 7.3 pence), an increase
of 38%.
Cash generated from operations was £9.2
million (2011: £8.1 million). After interest and
tax, net cash generated from operating
activities was £7.4 million (2011: £6.4 million).
At 30 November 2012 net debt was £3.9
million (2011: £5.1 million) after spending £3.3
million in cash on acquisitions during the year.
Dividends
The Directors recommend an improved final
dividend of 1.6 pence per share (2011: 
1.4 pence), making the full year dividend 
2.6 pence per share (2011: 2.4 pence).
Board composition
Paul Dean joined the Board in August 2012 
as an Independent Non-Executive Director. 
He brings extensive commercial and financial
experience in markets closely related to those
served by Porvair and has quickly settled in 
to his new role. He will become Chairman of
the Audit Committee from April 2013. He will
replace Michael Gatenby, who will retire from
the Board at the 2013 AGM in April. Michael
has been a Director for ten years, and has
made a substantial contribution to the
Group’s evolution over that time. We thank
him and wish him well. Andrew Walker will
succeed Michael as Senior Independent
Non-Executive Director.
Governance
The Board sets high standards for its Corporate
Governance of the Group and has in place
monitoring systems to ensure that those
standards are upheld throughout the Group.
The Board has complied with all aspects 
of the UK Corporate Governance code
throughout the year ended 30 November 2012
with the exception that the Non-Executive
Directors are not appointed for a fixed term.
However from this year, in accordance with
best practice, each Director will be subject 
to re-election at the Annual General Meeting. 
As a result of the larger contracts that the
Group has won recently, the Board has 
placed a greater focus in the year on the
management of risks associated with these
large overseas projects.
Staff
Much has changed at Porvair over the last 
five years. Sales revenues have increased 
by almost 70%, whilst staff numbers have
increased by a fifth over the same period.
At the start of 2013 the Group is on a sound
financial footing and there are plenty of
opportunities for growth. This is all due to our
excellent staff who can see the benefits of their
work in the 2012 results. The Board is most
grateful for their hard work and application.
Current trading and outlook
Porvair’s strategic direction and operating
objectives remain consistent and are producing
good results. We focus on niche markets
which have structural growth drivers. 2013 
has started well and order books are healthy.
The Board remains cautious about the general
economic outlook, but the fundamentals of 
the markets in which the Group operates look
satisfactory. After a record year we expect
revenue to grow at a more moderate rate in
2013. There is plenty of opportunity across
Porvair for market share gains and the Board’s
outlook is positive.
